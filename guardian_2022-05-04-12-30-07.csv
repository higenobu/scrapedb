5/4/2022,"Jacinda Ardern’s Labour party is continuing to slump in popularity, as New Zealand reckons with a losing cost of living crisis. New polling found the centre-right National party leads Labour although a Labour-led coalition would still have a strong chance at government. The Newshub-Reid research poll put Labour down 6.1 points to 38.2% since its last poll in February, and National up 9.2 points to 40.5%. Ardern’s personal popularity had also dropped 7%, to 36.3%. While still behind Ardern, National leader Christopher Luxon had risen in the preferred prime minister stakes at 23.9%, an increase of 6.1%. It marks Ardern’s lowest result in the Reid poll since she became prime minister in 2017, and the best result for a National leader since before that election. The latest poll is in line with other results earlier in the year. In March, a TVNZ/Kantor poll found National had overtaken Labour – albeit by a smaller margin – for the first time since the pandemic began. Those results mark a return to business-as-usual for New Zealand, which has typically relied on the development of multiparty coalition governments rather than single-party rule. The last election, in which Labour won a large enough chunk of the vote to govern alone, was a departure from the norm – driven by Ardern’s personal popularity, and huge support for the government’s Covid-19 response. Now, New Zealand’s attention has turned from the Covid response to the growing challenges of inflation and the cost of living. In April, annual inflation reached a 30-year high of 6.9%, and in March, food prices were 7.6% higher compared with a year prior. Despite government tax relief on petrol, prices at the pump have been driven up by the flow-on effects of the war in Ukraine. The cost of housing and renting remains a concern, with median rents up 7% year on year, while high prices continuing to lock many first-time buyers out of the housing market. Ardern told Newshub that the results reflected a difficult time for the country. “It has been a really difficult period for New Zealand and then of course, by default, that makes it a difficult period to govern through,” she said. “There will be from time to time tough decisions that need to be made and if that means that we take a bit of a hit in the numbers, so long as we stand by all of the decisions we’ve made - and we do - then that’s a price we’re willing to pay.” National party leader Christopher Luxon, who took the party’s helm this year, told the New Zealand Herald the results were a result of broad dissatisfaction from New Zealanders. “Why it’s happening is the public is just feeling that it’s a government that’s all spin and no delivery and it doesn’t get things done,” he said. Under the current numbers, both major parties would be courting coalition options beyond their traditional partners. On the right, the libertarian Act party is sitting at 6.4%, and on the left, the Greens at 8.4%. If the election were to take place tomorrow, that would place the left and right blocks neck and neck, with neither able to form a government with just one coalition partner. Both would be looking to Te Pati Māori – the Māori party – to get them over the edge, with its 2.5%. The next election must be held before January 2024.",News/World news,Jacinda Ardern acknowledges ‘difficult period’ as Labour party slumps again in polls ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/jacinda-ardern-acknowledges-difficult-period-as-labour-party-slums-again-in-polls
5/4/2022,"At the upcoming federal election, the two major parties look to deliver their lowest ever combined primary vote. Polls are indicating the ALP and Coalition will bring in less than 40% of the vote each. While there might be a small increase on Labor’s 2019 tally of 33.3%, the Coalition looks set for its lowest primary vote in history. There is also a good chance of a record number of independents and minor party candidates being elected. After years of “pandemic politics”, this might be a surprise to some. Covid-19 saw an increase of trust in government, with many incumbents benefiting from increased approval ratings. As the pandemic eases, though, confidence in Australian major parties is returning to earlier trends. For a while now, researchers have noticed a growing phenomenon called “anti-politics” in highly industrialised countries like ours. Anti-politics can be broadly understood as a growing mood of public disaffection towards politics and politicians. It encapsulates two key sentiments: that mainstream political systems aren’t functioning, and that they are designed to benefit the elites at the expense of everyday people. Anti-political sentiment has been identified as a cause, at least in part, for the Brexit vote in 2016 and the election of Donald Trump. The stark decline in trust in the established parties in much of Europe has also been identified as part of the phenomenon. The recent French presidential vote, for example, was the second election in a row in which neither of France’s historical major parties have advanced to the second round. While Australia has not seen a crisis of the political system in such a clear way, in our recent research published in the Journal of Australian Political Economy we studied patterns of political engagement in Australia to see whether they show a similar trend. What we found was stark. Australians are increasingly turning off mainstream politics. The most obvious trend is in voting patterns, with a steady and consistent decline of the combined vote for the ALP and Coalition. In the 1950s these parties were receiving over 95% of the combined primary vote. In this upcoming election they will be lucky to receive 70%. It has been a slow but steady decline. Alongside this has been a rise in the vote for minor parties. Most recently the Greens have caused the most disruption, challenging the ALP on the left. Things are no more rosy for the Liberals, however, with the United Australia party and One Nation undermining their vote and a new cohort of “teal independents” looking to cause headaches. Some are deciding not to vote at all. This is a key way anti-politics has been expressed in other parts of the world. The latest French presidential election had the lowest voter turnout since 1969. Compulsory voting means this trend is more hidden here, but even in the face of fines we found evidence that people are similarly starting to opt out. At the 2001 federal election, voter turnout was above 95%’; at the last election this had dropped to 91%. Informal (or invalid) votes are also on the rise, growing from 2% of the total vote in the 1950s to closer to 6% now. While some of this may be due to growing numbers of candidates (and the tablecloth-sized ballot), researchers believe a good proportion is people consciously choosing not to participate. Finally, both major parties have seen significant decline in their membership. While membership figures are kept secret, the public figures we do have indicate both parties peaked in the 1950s – when Labor had over 60,000 members and the Liberals about 150,000. Membership has now dropped to 40,000 and 50,000 respectively. So what is behind these trends? We concluded that voters feel politicians are increasingly focused on their own fortunes more than that of the community. Alongside this, the major parties and politicians have become disconnected from their traditional social bases. Voters are less “rusted on” than in the past. While Australia has not had a political eruption like Brexit or Trump, there is clear and growing destabilisation in our politics. One way this is epitomised is the revolving door of leadership in both major parties since Kevin Rudd was elected in 2007. With a fragile voter base and an electorate increasingly distrustful of politicians, parties have turned to turfing out leaders – and prime ministers – in an attempt to find someone (anyone) that the electorate might like more. This year’s federal election is a fight of who is disliked least. This is not a secure base for either leader to campaign on, and provides a weak mandate through which to implement a political agenda. With the pandemic poll bounce well and truly over, the era of anti-politics looks here to stay. We cannot expect a return to “normal” any time soon.

5/4/2022,"The former Formula One race winner and world championship contender Tony Brooks has died aged 90. His daughter Giulia announced the death on Tuesday. Brooks was one of the great British drivers of the 1950s and narrowly missed out on winning the F1 title in 1959. In his career, he won six grands prix and took 10 podiums from just 38 starts. During his era only Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari and Stirling Moss were more successful. In 1959 he joined Ferrari and won in France and Germany backed up with a second in Monaco. Despite two retirements he entered the final round at Sebring with a shot at the title. But on the opening lap he was hit by his teammate Wolfgang von Trips. Brooks had survived two huge accidents at Silverstone and Le Mans earlier in his career that had changed the way he approached racing and informed his actions at Sebring. “My natural inclination was to carry on,” he said. “Believe me, that would have been the easiest thing to do, but I made myself come in to have the car checked over.” He lost half a lap doing so and he finished third, not enough to prevent Jack Brabham, who had run out of fuel and pushed his car over the line for fourth, taking the title. Brooks was enormously liked and admired. He was a charming, unassuming gentleman and the unsung hero of an era when racing was exceptionally dangerous. Born on 25 February 1932 in Dukinfield, Cheshire, he began club racing in 1952 before joining Aston Martin’s sports car team in 1954. In 1955 he was studying for his finals in dentistry – the family profession – when he was called in as a last-minute replacement at the Connaught team for the Syracuse GP, which he then won. It was a remarkable feat, the first GP win for a British driver in a British car for 31 years and earned him the moniker of “the racing dentist”. Brooks joined Moss and Stuart Lewis-Evans at Vanwall in 1957 and a year later delivered perhaps the outstanding performances of his career, including victories at Spa, the Nürburgring and Monza. The wins on fearsome high-speed circuits was indicative of just what sublime touch and judgment Brooks possessed. He believed his win in Germany, passing the Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins, was his best drive. The 1959 season remained the high point, however, and with the switch to rear-engined cars Brooks was not as comfortable and he retired at the end of the 1961 season. He also proved himself in sports cars winning the Spa sports car GP and the Nürburgring 1000km in 1957. Before his death two years ago Moss paid great tribute to his teammate and friend. “Brooks was a tremendous driver, the greatest, if he’ll forgive me saying this, ‘unknown’ racing driver there’s ever been,” he said. “He was far better than several people who won the world championship.” The F1 chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, also acknowledged the loss of a great driver. “I was saddened to hear the news that Tony Brooks has died,” he said. “He was part of a special group of drivers who were pioneers and pushed the boundaries at a time of great risk. He will be missed and our thoughts are with his family at this time.”",Sport/Sport,"Former Formula One driver Tony Brooks, the ‘racing dentist’, dies aged 90",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/former-formula-one-driver-tony-brooks-the-racing-dentist-dies-aged-90
