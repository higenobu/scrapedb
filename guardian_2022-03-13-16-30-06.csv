3/13/2022,"For the singer Katy Perry the weekend has surely brought relief, with the resolution of a plagiarism claim that had dragged on for eight years. A California court ruled on Friday that she will not now have to pay the rapper Flame (real name Marcus Gray) £2.1m in compensation for the use of a nine-note sequence in one of her hits. But Ed Sheeran, the Halifax-born musical superstar, is not enjoying the same relief. He remains embroiled in the defence of the latest of a string of alleged breaches of copyright. He has treated lawyers to an impromptu performance of a Nina Simone tune to make a point about the essential building blocks of a song, and will return to the High Court in London this week. Such unpleasant, high-profile legal tussles have now become part of the burden of being an A-lister, a kind of humiliating occupational hazard for the elite group of international musicians who regularly bring out tracks that make them yet another fortune. “People only come for you like this if you have written a really huge song. Only a tiny minority are in this hallowed realm, with billion-streaming songs,” said Guy Chambers, who composed some of Robbie Williams’ biggest hits with him, including Angels and Let Me Entertain You. “Although claims are getting more common, it’s not going to happen to many people. Early on in my career I heard the old industry saying, ‘where there’s a hit there’s a writ’, and it’s true.” Chambers and Williams were in the line of fire together once. They went through a legal wrangle over Jesus in a Camper Van, a track from the platinum-selling album I’ve Been Expecting You. “So far I haven’t really had a dispute over the music. The case Robbie and I had was about lyrics, where it tends to be slightly more clear cut,” Chambers said. Williams and Chambers lost the case and a judge ordered that 25% of income generated by the song be paid to Ludlow Music and that it be dropped from future copies of the album. Sheeran, together with co-writers Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac, are continuing to defend themselves against the accusation that they stole an eight-note refrain from the relatively unknown grime act Sami Switch, real name Sami Chokri. The case centres on the hook line of Sheeran’s 2017 hit Shape of You which, it is claimed, has a “striking similarity” to the chorus of Chokri’s 2015 single Oh Why. Sheeran, 31, denies pinching the musical phrase and told the court last week that he had not heard Chokri’s song until he learned of the claim. Four years ago, in a preemptive swoop, Sheeran and his fellow songwriters asked for a legal declaration that they had not infringed any copyright, but months later Chokri and his own co-writer, Ross O’Donoghue, made a claim for damages and “an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement”. It is not the first time for Sheeran. Claim has followed claim recently in a predictable chain that must take some of the pleasure away from being hugely popular and immensely wealthy. Sheeran and McDaid, perhaps best known as a member of Snow Patrol, have already added the names of the writers of TLC’s No Scrubs to their credits for Shape of You due to discovered musical similarities and have also settled a case fought over their song Photograph. In addition they have paid out to the X Factor winner Matt Cardle over the song Thinking Out Loud. But last week McDaid angrily rejected the suggestion that such legal dealings indicate he “was in the habit of consciously or subconsciously appropriating the skill and labour of other songwriters during my songwriting and recording sessions”. Dua Lipa is another performer to be threatened by two expensive lawsuits, both over her song Levitating. Songwriters L Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer have claimed the opening melody of Levitating is a “duplicate” of some of their work. To back up their arguments they pointed out that Lipa openly admits to having “emulated prior eras” to create her sound. The American reggae band Artikal Sound System has also filed a suit claiming that Levitating is close to their 2017 track Live Your Life. And, of course, the mighty Taylor Swift has been dogged by an unsuccessful claim that her song Shake it Off was partly plagiarised. (Swift is open to a bit of early fair dealing. In advance of the release of her song Look What You Made Me Do her lawyers approached the British band Right Said Fred because of a resemblance suddenly detected to their jokey hit I’m too Sexy. The pair got a percentage of the writers’ credit.) The case that first raised the musical stakes, the yogic granddaddy of pop plagiarism cases, was the one Beatle George Harrison came to refer to as “the worst experience of my life”. In February 1971, while his solo hit My Sweet Lord was still high in the charts, he was sued by Bright Tunes Music Corp over the track’s similarities to The Chiffons’ He’s So Fine, a popular song put out a decade earlier. The case crawled on for years and a judge eventually found Harrison guilty of “unconscious plagiarism” because it was deemed likely that he would have heard The Chiffons’ tune. It is a creative syndrome now known as “cryptomnesia” and is pretty hard to guard against. Indeed Harrison, who had happily admitted that My Sweet Lord was consciously inspired by a 1968 version of Oh Happy Day, was so distressed by the plagiarism tag that he later told reporters he was paranoid about composing. “I thought, God, I don’t even want to touch the guitar or a piano in case I am touching somebody’s note.” Perry’s case last week revolved around her song Dark Horse, coincidentally the name of a Harrison 1974 solo album. Gray had sued her back in 2014 and won, but the verdict was later overturned. On Friday an appeals court upheld the decision, suggesting that to do otherwise would have stifled creativity. Industry expert Chris Cooke, founder of UnLimited, believes the ruling indicates that American courts, in this case the crucial Ninth Circuit, may be behaving more cautiously: “I hope there is an understanding now that some musical segments are going to appear in other places. Although it will be fascinating to see if there is a similar caution in the UK with the Sheeran case.” Chambers would welcome greater freedom for musicians: “If I was in the hit-making game now, rather than writing musicals, I would feel pressurised.” Like many songwriters he worried about the impact of the Blurred Lines case, when Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found guilty of merely copying “the feel” of Marvin Gaye’s song Got to Give it Up. Mike Smith, president at Downtown Music Services, believes his job as a music publisher is to protect his artists’ copyright, but he is generally wary of litigation, which he regards as an expensive American habit that mainly benefits lawyers. Musicians will always borrow ideas, Smith understands, but if those ideas are still in copyright then a “there is usually an acknowledgement of what has happened”. “A member of one of my old bands came in once and played a “new” tune to us. We all immediately pointed out it was the same as Werewolves of London by Warren Zevon, which he said he had just never heard.” New algorithms on streaming services promise technology that spots closely aligned harmonics at the touch of a button and, as Cooke points out, YouTube’s Content ID already performs a similar function for music publishers and record labels. “Anything posted that uses an existing song will be detected and the owners can then choose to monetise it or block it for usage. That’s not saying, of course, that any time it detects an unexpected similarity there is a case of copyright infringement. But these developments certainly mean there’s more sensitivity.” Chambers admits if a tune he is writing sounds familiar, he sometimes uses the Shazam music recognition app to check: “It’s not a particularly good way to do it. And anyway we are all inspired by something when we start. When I wrote Angels, I was thinking of Hey Jude. Its piano part has a similar feeling, although it’s not the same chords.” Chambers admires the more relaxed attitude of Elvis Costello, whose old hit Pump it Up appears close to a new Olivia Rodrigo track. Costello simply commented on Twitter:“It’s how rock and roll works. You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy. That’s what I did.”",Arts/Music,"From Ed Sheeran to Katy Perry, plagiarism claims are an occupational hazard for musicians",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/13/from-ed-sheeran-to-katy-perry-plagiarism-claims-are-an-occupational-hazard-for-musicians
3/13/2022,"Russia has escalated its war in Ukraine with a strike on a major military base in western Ukraine, only hours after the Kremlin warned that western supply lines into the embattled country were “legitimate targets”. Two large explosions were seen on Sunday at the base in Yavoriv, a garrison city just 12km from the Polish border. The rocket attack took place at 5.45am. “My windows shook. The whole house vibrated. It was dark. The sky lit up with two explosions,” Stepan Chuma, 27, an emergency worker said. Chuma said his colleagues had hurried to the scene, adding: “Many people have been injured.” The Lviv regional military administration said that airstrikes hit the International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security in Yavoriv. The security centre, which is about 50km west of Lviv, is a large military base that includes a training centre for soldiers, predominantly for peacekeeping missions. Lviv’s mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, said the facility was hit by eight missiles. Interfax Ukraine news agency cited Anton Mironovich, spokesperson for the academy of land forces of the Ukrainian armed forces, as saying: “According to preliminary data there are no dead, but information about the injured and wounded is being clarified.” Loud explosions and air raid sirens were heard in Lviv as well as Ivano-Frankivsk on Sunday morning. Unconfirmed reports suggested Ukrainian anti-aircraft defences may have intercepted a Russian missile in Lviv. The attack comes less than 24 hours after Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, warned that western shipments to Ukraine were “legitimate targets”. Supporters of Ukraine, including the UK, Germany and the US, have been shipping thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles into Ukraine using the country’s western corridor in the Lviv region. Ryabkov said that Russia had “warned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”. The attack is thought to be the most westernmost carried out by Russia in 18 days of fighting. Air raid sirens had been heard on previous nights in Lviv, a magnificent Unesco world heritage site 80km from the border with Poland and a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians. But although the city’s 700,000 residents are among the strongest supporters of Ukrainian independence from Moscow, it has so far remained untouched by Russian bombing. The war continued to rage across the rest of Ukraine on Saturday. In the south-east, the town of Volnovakha has been totally destroyed by Russian bombardment, according to regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. A local hospital was destroyed, forcing people to gather in the basement as pro-Russian separatists took over the town. “Volnovakha with its infrastructure as such no longer exists,” Kyrylenko told Ukrainian TV. The town is close to the besieged port city of Mariupol, where new satellite imagery has shown the widespread damage suffered since Russian forces surrounded the city 12 days ago. More than 1,500 civilians have been killed, and humanitarian aid groups say those remaining have not had access to water or medications in days. Zelenskiy urged Russia to uphold an agreed ceasefire to allow evacuations to proceed out of the city, after blaming Moscow for the failure of previous attempts. Britain’s defence ministry has said Russian ground forces were massed 25 km from the centre of Kyiv, Reuters reported. Its residents also woke to the sound of air raid sirens, and along with the rest of the nation, the words of Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy ringing in their ears: “We still need to hold on. We still have to fight.” Seven civilians have died after coming under Russian fire while trying to flee fighting near Kyiv. Ukraine initially accused Russia of firing at a convoy of civilian evacuees from the village of Peremoha while they were in a designated humanitarian corridor, but later said it was not such a route. In a video posted to social media late on Saturday night, Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians to keep fighting, and said Russia could not conquer Ukraine. “They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot. “But the invaders have no natural basis for normal life. So that people can feel happy and dream. They are organically incapable of making life normal! Wherever Russia come to a foreign land, dreams are impossible.” Zelenskiy noted humanitarian corridors had been working, with 12,729 people evacuated on Saturday, and made another plea to the international community to keep doing more for Ukraine. “Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe.” Russia is trying to create new “pseudo-republics”, he continued, adding that the city council members in Kherson, a southern city of 290,000, on Saturday rejected plans for a new pseudo-republic. The Russian military has reportedly installed a new mayor in the occupied south-eastern Ukrainian city Melitopol, after the alleged abduction of mayor Ivan Fedorov by Moscow’s troops on Friday afternoon. Zelenskiy has demanded his immediate release. Russia may also be positioning itself to use chemical weapons, which would amount to a war crime, Nato has warned. Its secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that the Kremlin was inventing false pretexts to justify the possible use of chemical weapons, Reuters reported. “In recent days, we have heard absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories,” he said. “Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime.” Meanwhile, further appeals from global leaders urging Putin to order an immediate ceasefire have failed to yield results. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke to Russian president Vladimir Putin by phone on Saturday, but a French official said: “We did not detect a willingness on Putin’s part to end the war”. US president Joe Biden has authorised $200m in weapons and other assistance for Ukraine, paving the way for the immediate shipment of small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. The rate of refugees crossing the Ukrainian border has slowed, but Ukraine’s neighbouring countries are still struggling to provide shelter for the estimated 2.6 million who have fled since the Russians invaded last month. Neighbouring countries may feel some reprieve over the coming weeks, following Britain’s announcement of a scheme to accommodate refugees, in the wake of intense scrutiny over its chaotic response to the crisis. British people who open their homes to Ukrainians will get £350 a month ($456) under a “cash for accommodation” scheme. Under the scheme Ukrainians who are matched and housed with a UK “sponsor” will be granted leave to remain for three years. They will be able to work, claim benefits and access public services in that time.",News/World news,Russia widens attacks on Ukraine with missile strike on base close to Polish border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/russia-widens-attacks-on-ukraine-with-missile-strike-on-base-close-to-polish-border
3/13/2022,"Even in a country now completely inured to the horrors of mass shootings, the massacre at Sandy Hook remains lodged in the minds of everyone old enough to remember it. Ten years ago, 20-year-old Adam Lanza fired 154 rounds from an AR-15-style rifle in less than five minutes. Twenty extremely young children and six adults were killed. It was the worst elementary school shooting in American history. Elizabeth Williamson’s new book is about that “American Tragedy”, but more importantly it is about “the Battle for Truth” that followed. In excruciating detail, Williamson describes the unimaginable double tragedy every Sandy Hook parent has had to endure: the murder of their child, followed by years and years of an army of online monsters accusing them of inventing this unimaginable horror. Alex Jones of Infowars is the best-known villain of this ghastly narrative. His Facebook pages and YouTube channels convinced millions of fools the massacre was either some kind of government plot to encourage a push for gun control or, even more obscenely, that it was all carried out by actors and no one was killed at all. While a single deranged shooter was responsible for the original tragedy, Williamson makes clear she believes Facebook and Google (the owner of YouTube) deserve most of the blame for the subsequent horror the relatives of victims have endured. As Congressman Ro Khanna reported in his new book, Dignity in a Digital Age, an internal Facebook document estimated that “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendations”. Those recommendations are the result of the infernal algorithms which are at the heart of the business models of Facebook and YouTube and are probably more responsible for the breakdown in civil society in the US and the world than anything else invented. “We thought the internet would give us this accelerated society of science and information,” says Lenny Pozner, whose son Noah was one of the Sandy Hook victims. But “really, we’ve gone back to flat earth”. It horrified Pozner “to see the image of his son, smiling in his bomber jacket, passed round by an online mob attacking Noah as a fake, a body double, a boy who never lived”. Relentless algorithms pushed those “human lies to the top” on an internet which has become an “all-powerful booster of outrage and denial”. Noah’s mother, Veronique De la Rosa, was another victim of Jones’s persistent, outrageous lies. “It’s like you’ve entered the ninth circle of hell,” she tells Williamson. “Never even in your wildest, most fear-fueled fantasies would you have guessed you’d find yourself having to fight not only through your grief, which you know is at times paralyzing, but to even prove that your son existed.” Lenny Pozner regularly saw his dead son described as an “alleged victim”, but it took years before Facebook and YouTube and Twitter took substantial action to quiet the insane conspiracies their own algorithms had done so much to reinforce. Facebook allowed a Sandy Hook Hoax group and dozens of others to operate virtually uninterrupted for two years. Hundreds of videos on YouTube, owned by Google, wallowed in the hoax, drawing thousands who made threats against the families. “Facebook and Twitter are monsters,” says Pozner. “Out-of-control beasts run like mom-and-pop shops.” Facebook “focuses on growth, to the exclusion of most everything else”, Williamson writes. The algorithms are designed to keep all of us on the platform as long as possible, and they operate “with relentless, sometimes murderous neutrality, rewarding whatever horrible behavior and false or inflammatory content captures and retains users”. In 2018, an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg by Pozner and De La Rosa, published in the Guardian, accused the Facebook chief of “allowing your platform to continue to be used as an instrument to disseminate hate”. Two days later, Facebook finally suspended Jones’s personal page but “took no action against Infowars’ account, which had 1.7 million followers”. YouTube removed four videos from Infowars’ channel and banned Jones from live-streaming for all of 90 days. Harry Farid heads the school of Information at the University of California Berkeley. He describes the perfect storm which is threatening democracy and civility everywhere: “You have bad people and trolls and people trying to make money by taking advantage of horrible things … you have social media websites who are not only welcoming and permissive of it but are promoting it, and then you have us, the unsuspecting public.” Williamson makes the important and usually forgotten point that nothing in the first amendment gives anyone the right to use a social media platform. All it says on this subject is that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” As Farid points out, platforms have an absolute right to ban all forms of content “without running afoul of the constitution” – which is why Donald Trump had no judicial recourse when he was banned from Facebook and Twitter after the Capitol riot. But most of the time, Farid says, the platforms just look the other way: “Because they’re making so much goddamned money.” Last fall, the California Democrat Adam Schiff told the Guardian the blockbuster testimony of the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen would finally be enough to spur Congress to regulate the worst excesses of the big platforms. So far, their lobbyists have prevented such action. On Saturday, the Guardian asked Schiff if he still believed Congress might act in this session. “There is still a chance,” he wrote in an e-mail, adding that “the degree of Russian propaganda on social media attempting to justify their bloody invasion of Ukraine” might finally provide the “impetus” needed for change.

3/13/2022,"On day three of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Victoria Gogh realised her mother was slipping away from her. “I noticed on the phone that mum was starting to parrot the government’s narrative about this war – that this was all the fault of Nato, that Russia had no choice but to defend itself,” said Gogh, 28, a fashion consultant originally from a small town in Siberia who moved to Moscow. “It became my mission to change her mind, to show her what was really going on,” said Gogh, who has strongly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on her social media channels. Vladimir Putin’s decision to start a war with Russia’s neighbour has seen many Ukrainian families torn apart, as their adult men are forced to stay behind and fight while other members of the family flee the violence. But Russia has also been experiencing its own family rifts – between those who back the war and those who oppose it. Often, that divide runs along generational lines. “In broad terms, younger Russians are less likely to have anti-Ukrainian sentiments. We have seen that the anti-war protests have also largely involved younger people,” said Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “A lot of how you perceive the war depends on where you get your news,” he said. “If you watch television, you are simply more likely to toe the official line. And older people tend to watch more TV.” In the past, polling has found that television remains the biggest news source for Russians, with more than 60% of the population relying on it for information. Russians over 65 are 51% more likely to watch television than under-25s. The full force of Russian state media has been mobilised to portray the war as a “special military operation” aimed at liberating Ukraine and protecting citizens in Donbas from Ukrainian “genocide”. Videos of Russian bombs hitting cities have been described as staged by the Ukrainian side. “We see that a majority of Russians appear to support the country’s actions, at least the way these actions are presented to them by the media,” Kolesnikov said. He said it was unsurprising, given the sensitivity of the topic, that the war had created tensions between families and friends: “It is very hard for people to accept that their side are actually the bad guys.” Gogh, who decided to leave the country last week after being detained for joining an anti-war protest in Moscow, said she eventually managed to convince her mother, Svetlana, of her country’s “devastating role” in the war. “But now I have to persuade my older cousins and uncles. I have got a whole list,” she joked. Her “mission” is likely to become even harder. On Friday, Russia announced a was block on Instagram, days after doing the same to Facebook and Twitter. The crackdown on social media – and Russia’s few remaining independent media outlets – will further restrict access to outside information on the war and boost the influence of state media. For others, like Dmitry, a tech consultant in Moscow, the war has already had disastrous consequences for his relationship with his family. “After the invasion, I wanted to move in with my parents to try to tell them what is really happening,” Dmitry said. During the first week of the war, he went through a daily ritual of showing his parents video clips of Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities and critical reports by independent bloggers and media outlets. “But none of it had any impact. It actually only made them more convinced that they were right. After a week, I moved back out of the house, and my mother has since texted that I am betraying my country.” The final straw came last Thursday, when his father sent him a news clip that claimed that Wednesday’s bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol had been staged by the Ukrainian authorities, with actors posing as injured mothers. This conspiracy theory has also been promoted by Russian officials. “It made me so angry. I am not sure we will ever be able to sit at the same table again,” Dmitry said, shrugging. “I think they have been zombified by state propaganda, and they truly see me as an enemy of the state. I have given up.” For some, even their own experiences of being shelled have not been enough to convince their loved ones about Russia’s real activities. The BBC and the New York Times have spoken to Ukrainians who said that their relatives in Russia simply would not believe that their cities were being bombarded. “My parents understand that some military action is happening here. But they say: ‘Russians came to liberate you. They won’t ruin anything. They won’t touch you. They’re only targeting military bases,’” said Oleksandra from Kyiv, describing to the BBC her attempts to explain to her parents that the Ukrainian capital was under Russian attack. Ilya Krasilshchik, a popular Russian blogger and former tech executive, asked his 110,000 followers on Instagram to send him their own stories of family infighting. Krasilshchik said he soon received “hundreds of screenshots” from young Russians, showing heated and emotional exchanges with their parents. He decided to post some of those conversations to show young Russians that they weren’t alone. “Clearly, this war has been a very traumatic experience for many families in this country.”",News/World news,‘My mother says I am betraying Russia’: Putin’s invasion divides the generations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/my-mother-says-i-am-betraying-russia-putins-invasion-divides-the-generations
3/13/2022,"Joe Biden visited Texas last week. But it was no ordinary campaigning trip to a state Democrats hungrily eye as a target to flip from red to blue. Instead the US president was speaking about an issue with personal resonance: burn pits. That is the catch-all term used to describe how American soldiers in foreign wars were exposed to toxic chemicals from incinerated military waste that years later causes debilitating disease and death to thousands of veterans. One of those victims, Biden believes, could be his son Beau. In his recent State of the Union address, Biden talked about burn pits – excavations filled with any and all waste from a deployment and set aflame with jet fuel or diesel – saying exposure could have led to the death of Beau, who served a year-long tour of duty in Iraq and later died of brain cancer. “When they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best-trained warriors in the world were never the same. Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness. A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know,” Biden said. In Texas, Biden met with veterans, including one who was stationed near a pit and later had six weeks of treatment and chemotherapy, and said that access to healthcare and benefits for affected veterans should be expanded. “They shouldn’t have to ask for a damn thing,” Biden said. “It should be, ‘I’ve got a problem’ and we should say, How can I help?’” The Department of Defense estimates that roughly 3.5 million service members could have been exposed to burn pits during America’s wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan. A legislative battle is now under way to require the Department of Veterans Affairs to expand its recognition of the health consequences of burn pit exposure. Biden said he’d sign it, and it is nearing Senate approval after passing the House two weeks ago. But the experience of veterans has been much like those American soldiers returning from Vietnam after being exposed to the toxic defoliant Agent Orange and began reporting symptoms, including various types of cancer. They face disbelief and skepticism. It took more than two decades for Congress to pass the 1991 Agent Orange Act and another 30 years to pass the Veterans Agent Orange Exposure Equity Act, which shifted the burden from veterans having to prove exposure to the presumption of exposure to the herbicide. “Many Afghanistan and Iraq veterans who were exposed to burn pits are now starting to develop illnesses that they believe are linked to these types of exposure,” said Aleks Morosky, deputy director with the Wounded Warrior project. “What we know is that many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who were exposed are now getting sick and dying.” Morosky, who served two tours in Iraq, says that soldiers on active combat duty were primarily concerned with enemy fire and roadside bombs. “The fumes from a burn pit may be a nuisance but it’s not the most dangerous thing, front of mind, when you’re over there. It’s only years later that we’ve come to realize how damaging this stuff might have been.” During the Gulf war of 1990-91 returning soldiers reported symptoms including fatigue, headaches, joint pain, indigestion, insomnia, dizziness and respiratory disorders that became known collectively as Gulf war syndrome. Among the possible causes was chemical warfare agents, particularly nerve gas, or pyridostigmine bromide, which was given as a preventive measure against exposure to chemical weapons. But Gulf war syndrome, like the symptoms of Agent Orange exposure and burn pit exposure, can produce multifaceted conditions that lack uniformity and are not easily linked in medical terms to a set of symptoms. Under the Agent Orange Act, says Morosky, “there was a scientific framework in place that triggers determinations by the VA and a list of conditions that are presumed to be connected to service in an area of known exposure. We feel we need an Agent Orange Act for the 21st century.” But today it remains difficult for individual veterans to prove the exposure to burn pits caused their health problems, and in most cases, the VA doesn’t consider exposure a service-related condition. The Department of Veterans Affairs has denied about 75% of veterans’ burn pit claims. Last year the VA established a presumption of service connection for asthma, sinusitis and rhinitis based on exposure to fine particulate matter for veterans who served any time after August 1990 in the south-west Asia theater of operations, as well as Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti or Uzbekistan on or after 19 September 2001. As of this month 30,000 had filed claims, with 73% of 18,105 processed claims being granted so far. In a statement to the Guardian, a VA spokesperson said: “While there are differences between herbicide agents, such as Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam war, and airborne hazards in the Gulf war region, VA takes seriously any claim for disability due to military environmental exposure.” It continued: “The VA will continue to study the long-term health effects from airborne hazards in the Gulf war region.” Support for veterans has come from Biden, who announced that the VA will take new steps to care for veterans diagnosed with nine cancers related to chemical exposure, and from TV political satirist Jon Stewart, who appeared on Capitol Hill last week to promote the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2021. Stewart warned lawmakers not to stall the bill. “Fuck that,” he said. Last year he told NBC: “I would challenge any congressperson who says, ‘Well, we’re going to wait for the science to be settled,’ to dig a 100-yard pit in the middle of a town where your constituents live, and burn everything in that town with jet fuel. And then come and tell me that, ‘Yeah, they’re cool with it, because there’s a lot of confusion about whether or not the science is settled that this is harmful to your health.’” Biden’s son Beau was a major in a Delaware army national guard unit that deployed to Iraq in 2008. He was later named Delaware attorney general before being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2013. He died two years later at age 46. “We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops,” Biden said in Texas. “But I’m committed to finding out everything we can.” In a response, the VA said: “Any veteran who believes he or she has a disability related to military service would be encouraged to file a claim.” One soldier who fell sick after serving in Iraq is 54-year-old army veteran Andrew Myatt, who completed several tours in the Middle East. During a routine physical three years ago, he was referred to an oncologist who diagnosed an aggressive form of adult leukemia. After three years of chemotherapy treatments the cancer is in remission. But the VA has denied Myatt’s eligibility. “I served with honor so it was frustrating to be told, in effect, you’re old and broken and we don’t need you,” he said. “You have to prove you were exposed and that exposure caused what you have.” Myatt points out that the burn pit exposure is not necessarily a war zone issue. The military uses burn pits to dispose of material on foreign training exercises as well. According to a 2019 report from the defense department, there were nine active military burn pits in the Middle East as of 2018. A 2015 report from a Pentagon inspector general said it was “indefensible” that military personnel were “put at further risk from the potentially harmful emissions” from the use of burn pits. Myatt reasons that all military engagements come with lessons of what could have been done better. For his generation, it’s the burn pits or other toxic exposure-related illnesses. “We’d like to see the legislation go through,” he said. “There are a lot of things service members are coming down with – leukemia, skin cancer, lung cancer, brain tumors – that haven’t been seen as cause-and-effect of our exposure while serving our government in a wartime fashion.”",News/US news,Toxic burn pits put the health of US veterans at risk.

3/13/2022,"The longest medieval cathedral in the world, Winchester, is 170 metres (558ft) from end to end. The new stations on the Elizabeth line are 240 metres (788ft) or more long, and sometimes nine or 10 storeys underground. And these are only the most visible manifestations of the vast volumes hollowed out of the London soil to achieve an underground railway bigger and faster than any before, of what was at one point the largest transport engineering project in Europe, decades and billions of pounds in the making, a system more technologically complex, says its chief executive, than any outside China. Sometime soon – those in charge won’t be more specific than “the first half of 2022” – 10 of these stations on the central section of the line will open. Another, Bond Street, will open a little later. To visit them now and ride the distance-shrinking trains, as I did over the past three weeks, is eerie and impressive. It is an alternate universe of London transport, hitherto unseen. Everything – trains, signs, lights, doors, advertisements – is up and running. It’s just that there aren’t yet any passengers. It is as if you took a traditional underground line and pressed a three-dimensional enlarge button. The trains will carry up to 1,500 passengers, which is nearly twice as many as, for example, the Piccadilly line, at rates (eventually) of up to 24 trains per hour. At Liverpool Street the platforms extend enough to reach what, in the old money of not-supersized tubes, is a wholly different station, Moorgate. When the line is fully joined up and operational – in 2023, we’re told – its 73 miles (118km) of track, 26 miles (42km) of it in new tunnels, will run uninterrupted east-west, across the capital and beyond. It will go from Reading in Berkshire to Shenfield in Essex and Abbey Wood in south-east London. To return to the cramped old Central line after a visit to the Elizabeth line is to feel like Alice in Wonderland after she ate her enlarging cake. This megalopolis of engineering currently lies there, pristine, unspotted by gum or pigeon, with its 319-tonne trains gliding quietly through every few minutes, empty, so that those operating the system can familiarise themselves with the choreography of all that heavy metal. Electronic indicator boards announce their coming with white digits, a notch classier than the orange ones on the old tube. Double layers of doors, there being a glass wall between platform and train, swish open and shut. The coming of the Elizabeth line, formerly known as Crossrail, has long been a background hum. Its opening was formerly promised for 2018, then 2019, then some time between October 2020 and March 2021. But few appreciate the scale of its potential impact. London’s underground railway network, which has been growing in fits and starts since the 1860s, is about to expand by 10%. The line will in effect make the city bigger, putting an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of central London. It will run through some of the poshest and poorest places, Bond Street in the West End and Custom House, Newham, in the east. It will take half an hour to get from the centre of the capital to Heathrow. The line sprinkles real estate fairy dust everywhere it goes. Woolwich, the military and ex-industrial district of south-east London, whose connections formerly consisted of buses, sluggish trains and a quaint but cumbersome ferry across the Thames, now finds itself 15 minutes from the City of London. Here sprout the towers and blocks of a 5,000-home development by the Berkeley Group. Through the centre of the city, high-specification office buildings and apartment blocks are blossoming, in places fertilised by the underground engineering. Enthusiasm for the line unites the Green party’s London assembly member and former leader Siân Berry with the prime minister, Boris Johnson. “It’s genuinely a really, really good project,” she says. “It’s game-changing for London.” Johnson, as mayor of London, called it “a huge success for the UK economy” and a “transformative new railway”. Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary, calls it “a huge boost to transport capacity in London, a huge extension of the effective commuting zone into central London”. All of which raises questions. The spirit of the project is that of an era of London boosterism, when it seemed that this “world city” could only become bigger, richer and more dazzling, and that this direction of travel would without question be magnificent and beneficial to the whole country, an attitude that took a severe knock with Brexit and has received more blows since. The pandemic reduced the attractions of drawing millions into densely populated city centres. If working from home, at least some of the time, is here to stay, a giant people-moving machine might become less essential. Transport for London (TfL) faces a post-Covid-19 funding crisis, inauspicious for the opening of such an ambitious work. The effects of the Ukrainian conflict and of sanctions on Russia, economic and otherwise, remain to be seen. It’s worth asking whether giant projects such as the Elizabeth line are the way of the future. It has cost £18.25bn, and it is 33 years since it was proposed in its current form in something called the Central London Railway Study. It can take a generation, in other words, to make something such as this happen. Since we are in a climate emergency, whatever environmental benefits may come from further such splurges on public transport – which incur upfront carbon and energy costs in their construction – may now come too late. Some gurus of mobility argue that driverless electric cars, by using road space efficiently and removing the environmental problems of petrol and diesel, will eventually push urban railways towards obsolescence. And, given that the government has expressed its belief in levelling up other parts of the country, especially in the Midlands and north, huge investment in London’s already extensive transport infrastructure may seem less compelling now than in the past. “I’m sure it’s a splendid piece of technology,” says John Whitelegg, visiting professor at Liverpool John Moores University and an expert in sustainable transport, “but the government told Liverpool it couldn’t have a tram system. How dare we spend £18bn on Crossrail.” The essential characteristics of the Crossrail concept are that it is a big, fast train that goes from one side of the capital to the other – a heavy railway placed underground. Its origins go back at least to the 1940s (though some trace it to an idea mooted in the 19th century), when it was proposed as part of the postwar reconstruction of London. The name Crossrail came out of a 1974 study that estimated its cost at £300m. The 1989 Central London Rail Study developed the concept, and further work was done in the 1990s and 2000s. Still, though, central government balked at paying for it. The financial crisis of 2008 seemed to put the project in jeopardy – how could such expenditure be justified when the government was running out of money? – but an act of parliament was passed and both main parties committed to building it. Contractors were appointed, preliminary works started, land acquired, obstacles – which included the venerable London Astoria music venue near Tottenham Court Road – demolished. Paddington The station at Paddington, designed by Weston Williamson, descends in a deep chasm from the former taxi rank alongside Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s famous Victorian terminus. Sturdy columns and large disc-shaped light fittings give a sense of substance and scale. The 120-metre glass canopy above is printed with Cloud Index, a changing image of the sky by the American artist Spencer Finch, which is part of the line’s extensive programme of public art. Bond Street Like most of the Elizabeth line’s central stations, Bond Street comes with significant new development above ground, including a large new commercial building in Hanover Square. Colonnades around the entrances have been designed by the architects John McAslan + Partners to give “a great sense of openness and civic presence”. It has been called the line’s “problem station”, with an increase in budget from £111m to £660m, and its opening will be delayed. Tottenham Court Road The new station exits at one end at the foot of Centre Point, the famous and now-listed 1960s tower. At the other it emerges into the heart of Soho. The architects Hawkins\Brown has given them “daytime” and “night‑time” characters, one bright and airy, the other finished in dark terrazzo. At platform level there is a network of Grimshaw-designed tunnels and passages, luminous and uncluttered. Liverpool Street The length of the Elizabeth line platforms means that those at Liverpool Street reach to the next station on the old underground system, Moorgate. A long subterranean avenue runs from one to the other, with the curving concrete-clad vaults that Grimshaw Architects has designed for several stations. The entrances and exits, by the architects WilkinsonEyre, are animated by shallow fan patterns in concrete and steel. Whitechapel Formerly a cramped and convoluted tube station, Whitechapel is now bridged by an ample new concourse, and oversailed by a swooping roof, which its architects BDP says will help connect communities on either side of the tracks. Like all new Elizabeth line stations, it is wheelchair-accessible to platform level. Some of the details are clunky, but the new station gives new grandeur and dignity to the daily commute. Woolwich The area famous for its old armaments factories, poorly connected until now, is being transformed by the Elizabeth line. A development of 5,000 homes is going up around it, by property company Berkeley Homes, which also helped to build the station and provided the land for it. The architects Weston Williamson has given it a military theme, with strips of regimental colour on its bronze-clad columns In 2012 four pairs of 1,000-tonne, £10m tunnel boring machines, giant mechanical moles with the canteen and toilet facilities of a small ship, started chewing through the subterranean mud. Huge caverns were formed, and 7m tonnes of earth expelled, three-quarters of it to form a new nature reserve at Wallasea Island in Essex. Three-tonne sections of concrete, to make tunnels meant to last at least 120 years, were installed with heft and precision. The route had to be plotted with care, snaking around to avoid the foundations of skyscrapers, sewers and other underground tunnels. The operation had byproducts: it became the largest archaeological dig in Britain, uncovering pieces of a woolly mammoth’s jawbone, flint tools, Roman coins, Tudor shoes, Victorian pickle jars and numerous skeletons, many of them those of plague victims. Community centres were redecorated, a city farm spruced up, a literary festival supported, as part of a programme to support the neighbourhoods where the works took place. Public art, including the mile-plus-long “Newham wall” on which the locally raised Sonia Boyce controversially mentioned the murder rate in the area of north Woolwich, was extensively commissioned. The last time I wrote about Crossrail, in 2013, which involved exploring deep vaults of concrete and clay, I heard confident-going-on-hubristic claims about its delivery within time and its then budget of £14.8bn. “Do not underestimate UK plc’s ability to deliver such projects,” the then Crossrail chief executive Andrew Wolstenholme told me; Britain “has developed a skill set and a reputation second to none”. It didn’t quite work out like that. “We got ourselves into a pickle,” says Mark Wild, who became chief executive in 2018, with the task of sorting things out. The civil engineering – the heavy stuff – had gone well, “a brilliant, brilliant job”, completed in about 2015. But “we got into a muddle” with all the systems that go into it, “the immense density of digitisation”, the “world’s most complex signalling”. It is, though, a common rule of construction that time and money, which seem paramount before a project is completed, are rapidly forgotten thereafter. Few who swipe their cards on the ticket barriers will be much bothered about the difference between nearly £15bn and £18bn-plus, and the four-year delay will be forgotten. What they will see are what Andy Byford, who has been London’s transport commissioner since May 2020, calls “aesthetically stunning” stations. “I think people will be blown away when they see the scale and the very pleasant environments.” There is some history to the design of underground train stations. There are the palatial caverns of Moscow, rococo and neo-classical, ballroom-like, encrusted with sculpture and painting. There are the more restrained structures – such as the chaste rotunda and semi-rotunda that respectively stand over Arnos Grove in north London and Chiswick Park in the west – built under the leadership of Frank Pick, who was chief executive of London Transport in its glory years in the 1930s. These are elegant and considered, with touches of quality in bronze or stone, part of a unified vision of a well-designed public service that also included signs, typefaces, advertising and the famous London underground map. The Elizabeth line architecture is more in the Frank Pick tradition than Moscow’s. “We’re not being extravagant,” Byford is at pains to say. “We don’t have chandeliers.” Instead you get what they call “line-wide design”, by the engineer Atkins, Grimshaw Architects, the designer Maynard and the lighting designer GIA Equation, whereby seats and fire equipment and all the other paraphernalia of stations are marshalled into a consistent, robust and uncluttered design. Speakers, signs and lights are organised into free-standing “totems”. In the stations that are tunnelled (as opposed to being placed in boxes), the same systems of curving concrete panels are employed throughout. Full-scale mock-ups were built to make sure it would all fit together well. The effect is luminous. Visual bric-a-brac is kept under control, and advertising is restricted to those places where it will be most noticed; for example, on video screens next to the doors to the trains, which leaves expanses of pale walls, softly uplit, scored by the joints in the concrete and perforated above head height for acoustic reasons. Where one passage joins another the corners are rounded, which will ease the flow of people. It also makes for pleasing shapes where one curve meets another, the concrete folding like handkerchiefs in the wind, of a complexity that would be impossible without digital design and manufacturing. These large pieces of people-plumbing feel smooth and homogeneous, as if formed out of a single substance. The idea is to be calm and clear, a world away from the muck and rattle of the old tube, and to help people find their way around. Given the length of the platforms, a wrong turning by a passenger could result in a long, wasted walk. Then, in the sections that connect to the streets above, the designs become more individual and bespoke, in response to the particularities of the neighbourhood. Ten different architectural practices have designed the 11 stations of the central section, making them a showcase for the more engineering-minded end of British architecture. At Tottenham Court Road, Hawkins\Brown Architects has given different characters to the entrances at the opposite ends of the station: a “nocturnal” connection in dark terrazzo to the fleshpots of Soho, a light and airy “daytime” one at the other end. Weston Williamson, the architect for Woolwich, has designed a disciplined file of sturdy columns, bronze-clad at their base, decorated with strips in the colours of the regiments associated with the area’s historic military facilities. The project’s architects like to exploit the drama given to them by the engineering, such as deep plunges down from pavement level at Paddington and Tottenham Court Road. WilkinsonEyre, at Liverpool Street, has conceived a concrete vault that folds like shallow origami, whose triangular patterns are echoed in aluminium panels on the escalator walls. The firm has also made a thing of the crisscross trusses of an office block above the station’s western entrance, which carry the new building over the big open spaces below. These stations feel more orderly and managed than those of the Jubilee line extension, completed in 1999, at the time a bold and famous adventure in architectural commissioning. The late Will Alsop, who designed the moodily dramatic dark blue North Greenwich station for the Jubilee line, initially worked on Paddington for the Elizabeth line, but the job eventually went to Weston Williamson, also a veteran of the Jubilee line, but more level-headed. Sometimes, in the new stations, calm and consistent translates as bland. A few details, as a result of the ways in which large buildings are now procured and built, clunk. The stations tend to get less convincing where they engage with their messy surroundings at street level, more so when they get close to trains and engineering. But the dominant impressions are of handsomeness and amplitude, expressed in big circular light fittings at Paddington or the high-ceilinged rebuild of the formerly crabby layout of Whitechapel. This composite work of architecture is one to which some people have given the best part of their careers. Julian Robinson, the project’s head of architecture, has been working on it (with breaks to work on the Jubilee line and the London 2012 Olympics) since 1992. Roger Hawkins of Hawkins\Brown tells how his wife gave birth to their son the night after he was interviewed for the Tottenham Court Road commission. The lad will turn 30 next week. One of the project’s most remarkable achievements is its unity and cohesion, given the multiplicity of consultants, contractors, suppliers and commissioning organisations. This is not the work of a single public body but of multiple partnerships with the private sector. The stations at Woolwich and Canary Wharf, for example, were built by the private developers that own the respective sites. So this queen of tubes, branded in royal purple, will hopefully open in time for its namesake’s platinum jubilee. The purpose of the architecture is not just vanity, but also to raise the desirability and prestige of public transport, so as encourage people out of cars. The stations will also give a lift to their neighbourhoods – not much needed in Bond Street, perhaps, but helpful in some of the less favoured places touched by the line. The line will, says Byford, be “the ultimate symbol of London’s re-emergence from Covid, a massive morale boost”. Berry says: “A car-free recovery is exactly what we need. It will make a difference to many people’s perceptions.” Wild says: “The asset that we have built is one of this century’s great engineering achievements.” Byford acknowledges that the pandemic “has driven coach and horses” through TfL’s plans, and is worried about short-term underfunding, which could lead to a “downward spiral” of managed decline, but he says that the business case for the Elizabeth line “is still compelling”. Pre-Covid, the prediction for passenger numbers in 2026 was 250 million. “Now it’s 130-170 million but could be 200 million.” Tony Travers, visiting professor at the London School of Economics’s department of government, believes that London will bounce back: “If plague and cholera and the second world war and deindustrialisation didn’t do for London, you have to assume that it will survive.” In which case the Elizabeth line, “whose case was based on the ever-growing density of London”, will be justified. On the question of levelling up, the line’s fans have many answers. One is the amount of work that its construction created nationwide: 75,000 people have worked on Crossrail, says Wild, “the majority of them all over the country”. He cites trains from Derby, vitreous enamel signs from the Isle of Wight, fire doors from Bolton, fibre communications from Ashby de la Zouch. Travers argues that failure to invest in London’s transport would be a case of levelling down, not up. In which case global companies such as Google wouldn’t look to locate in other British cities, but international rivals such as Amsterdam. He points out that most of the funding of the Elizabeth line comes not from central government but from business rates, levies on development and other sources within the capital. Also, that London has large areas of deprivation that are as much in need of levelling up as anywhere else. None of which satisfies Whitelegg. Transport spending per head, he says, citing a 2018 report, is £944 per head per year in London, compared with £314 in the West Midlands. It would be much better to invest in local integrated networks of buses and cycling of a kind that he has worked on in Germany and elsewhere that benefit “more people more immediately at lower cost”. He argues that there is a remarkable lack of evidence for the Elizabeth line’s alleged environmental benefits. What the Midlands and north have been offered instead is the HS2 high-speed rail link, costing about £100bn, of uncertain delivery date and whose scale makes the Elizabeth line look like a Tri-ang Hornby toy. Meanwhile, London’s Crossrail 2, a north-south version of the same idea, has been put on hold. Travers points out that infrastructure projects are not conceived in conditions of calm objectivity, but reflect such things as the lobbying power of particular cities – in the case of the Elizabeth line, the City of London and an organisation called London First did much to push the project through. The mighty construction industry that builds such projects also has political momentum. What gets built is not theoretically the best solution, but the most likely to be achieved in the circumstances. It is never really possible to know, once it’s built, how a given project would compare with imaginary alternatives. So maybe there is a better, smarter £18bn theoretical transport project than the one that is about to open, that will never be seen. There is good reason to believe that there are better, smarter alternatives to HS2. But, for now, the natural reaction to the Elizabeth line is to be deeply impressed.",News/UK news,A megalopolis of engineering: the verdict on London’s £18bn new Elizabeth line,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/13/elizabeth-line-crossrail-opening-london
3/13/2022,"One of John Bercow’s unfortunate subordinates, recalling how “spectacularly” the former Commons Speaker lost his temper, compared the transformation to “Jekyll and Hyde”. Although Bercow has objected to her account (“the suggestion that I waved my arms… with spittle coming from my mouth is disgusting, offensive and untrue”) and called the investigation “amateurish” and based on “tittle-tattle”, the comparison is probably one of the more forgiving lines in the report that the Commons’ independent expert panel has entitled, rather beautifully, The Conduct of Mr John Bercow. For, if Bercow could behave despicably, the idea that he had a wholly delightful alter ego called Mr Speaker might suggest that his many Commons admirers weren’t simply duped by his rewarding transformation from Enoch Powell fan into a champion of diversity and inclusion. Maybe, like the inhuman Mr Hyde and decent Dr Jekyll (“one of your fellows who do what they call good”), Bercow really could be both things at the same time? Perhaps it was possible for the man David Lammy called an “intergalactic hero” to double as the “serial bully” of the new report? Not that Bercow limited himself to that: “The respondent has lied extensively to try and avoid the damning reality of the truth,” the panel found. To toggle between the panel’s conclusions and the Commons effusions when Bercow finally left in 2019 can certainly feel like reading about two separate people. “Your humanity and personal touch will never be forgotten” was typical, along with “you are an extraordinary man”; “thank you for being such a good human being”. The person who we know to have been “offensive, malicious and insulting” to one Commons staffer, “leaving the complainant feeling undermined, humiliated and denigrated”, would himself leave Westminster, according to Thangam Debbonaire, “billowed up on a cloud of love and admiration from us all”. Elsewhere though, it’s clearly the same person, different audience. Staff described Bercow mimicking them “by way of mocking caricature”. For admirers, such turns made him all the more adorable. “You have your talent – that of mimicry, your voices and all that stuff,” said the Labour MP Barry Sheerman. Like most workplace bullies, Bercow appears to have monstered selectively, picking moments and people, never inadvertently slipping like Jekyll into Hyde mode (“I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change”). “My own personal experience is different to the things I read in the report,” said non-victim Emily Thornberry, in 2018, as if this were a reason not to act on other people’s allegations. If such unquestioning commitment now seems hard to credit, it could be worth considering that the trait of Machiavellianism has been strongly associated with perpetrators of workplace bullying, with dishonest Machiavellians “the biggest bullies of all”. “It is for historians to judge,” says the newest report on Bercow’s behaviour, “whether the respondent was a successful reforming Speaker of the House of Commons. However, there was no need to act as a bully to achieve that aim.” The Labour party, which finally suspended Bercow last week, has been slow to reach agreement. In 2018, Margaret Beckett had wanted him to stay as Speaker because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”. Thornberry, not that she’d witnessed bullying, could nonetheless see things from the bully’s perspective: “I appreciate that there must be times when it is extremely frustrating trying to get, trying to drag the House of Commons into the 21st century.” To be fair to Thornberry, her implied distinction between bog-standard bullying and a justifiable, virtuous kind is one widely in use. In fact, for some of our most active social justice advocates, the message of the Bercow report, that all workplace bullying is bad, regardless of the visionary claims of the perpetrators, must be distinctly unwelcome. Must progressives deny themselves even occasional name-calling and intimidation? Sheerman, a former chair of the all-party parliamentary group on bullying, remains defiant. Bercow, he tweeted, was “a great reforming Speaker of the House of Commons who deserves our thanks & respect”. As for the Conservatives, a renewed enthusiasm for bullying has, alas, prevented them glorying as fully as they might have wished in Labour’s Bercow difficulties. It’s tricky, after all, to ridicule Labour hypocrisy on workplace respect when the current home secretary is, as confirmed by an official report, the most powerful bully in the land. Lest Priti Patel’s survival be explained as a regrettable necessity, dictated purely by the shortage of comparably affectless candidates, the party has further illustrated its commitment to dignity at work by bullying Kathryn Stone, the standards commissioner tasked with investigating bullying. Kwasi Kwarteng said she should “decide [on] her position”. Mark Spencer, the former whip accused of bullying lowlier MPs, is now leader of the house. On the backbenches, Daniel Kawczynski stands up for brutes by, having apologised for bullying, saying he didn’t mean it. Actually, if Andrea Leadsom (who was once insulted by the Speaker) was right to demand Bercow’s exclusion from Labour membership, and others justifiably question his professorship at Royal Holloway University of London, what is Patel doing in her – in any – job? At his public resignation from the Home Office, her permanent secretary, Sir Philip Rutnam, mentioned allegations of belittling, shouting and swearing, an “atmosphere of fear”. Boris Johnson then ignored the conclusion of Sir Alex Allan, his adviser on ministerial standards, that Patel’s conduct amounted to bullying. Allan resigned. Rutnam later received a settlement of £340,000, with £30,000 in costs. If it has always been obvious that normalising bullying and trashing codes of conduct extract a social cost, we are still learning how much suffering and shame comes of government by bullies in a humanitarian crisis. Patel’s failures of empathy and twisted notions of acceptable behaviour now shape the national response to freezing, bombed-out Ukrainian families, as well as to refugees in dinghies. When investigated for in-person bullying, Patel said (inaccurately) that nobody told her it was wrong. What’s her excuse this time?

3/13/2022,"Caroline Elkins made front-page headlines a decade ago when her research into Britain’s brutal suppression of the Mau Mau movement in Kenya in the 1950s resulted in a high court case and, uniquely, reparations to 5,228 surviving Kenyans who, the British government accepted, had been subject to years of systematic torture and abuse. That case relied on evidence uncovered in Elkins’s 2005 book, Britain’s Gulag, which had argued that up to 320,000 Kenyan Kikuyu people had been held in British detention camps as part of a campaign of terror that “left tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, dead” and untold numbers of lives ruined by forced labour, starvation, torture and rape. When Elkins’s book came out, her findings – partly based on the testimony of Kikuyu survivors – were widely dismissed as, at best, exaggerations by a generation of historians wedded to stubborn ideas of Britain’s “enlightened” and “benign empire”. Her history was dramatically vindicated, however, when an unknown cache of 240,000 top secret colonial files, removed from Nairobi at the time of Kenyan independence in 1963, were disclosed on the eve of the 2011 trial. The files had been stored in a high security foreign office depository at Hanslope Park, near Northampton. At the time of that high court victory, Elkins noted that she had for years put on hold a wider inquiry into the methods of British colonial governance in the years after the second world war, in order to substantiate the survivors’ case, research that would now be illuminated by the fact that the secret document store also held “lost” records from 37 other former colonies. She was both vindicated and outraged by the discovery: “After all these years of being roasted over the coals, they’ve been sitting on the evidence? Are you frickin’ kidding me? This almost destroyed my career.” This book, a decade on, is that wider history that Elkins had postponed. Partly resting on the Hanslope Park files, it argues that the sadistic methods that marked the last acts of empire in Kenya were not an anomalous aberration but learned behaviours of imperial power. Her detailing of this reality involves a deconstruction not only of the self-delusion, seductive mythology and doublespeak of the largest empire in human history, but also the deliberate official destruction of large parts of its historical record. As a result of her work on Kenya, Elkins, 53, a native of New Jersey, is now not only professor of history and African and African American studies at Harvard, and founding director of its Center for African Studies, she is also the subject of a proposed Erin Brockovich-style film. There is nothing about her work that suggests any of the easier of Hollywood narratives, however. Legacy of Violence is a formidable piece of research that sets itself the ambition of identifying the character of British power over the course of two centuries and four continents. Elkins, perhaps minded of her previous brush with controversy, sometimes approaches her task with the meticulous doggedness of a trial lawyer rather than a storyteller in search of an audience. Examining the Boer war, the Irish war of independence, the uprisings in India, Iraq and Palestine, as well as British rule in Cyprus, Malaya and Kenya, she insists that such appalling acts as the Amritsar massacre, far from being – as Churchill argued in parliament – “an event that stands in singular and sinister isolation” were much closer to being a default position. This often gruesome history is bookended by two trials. The Mau Mau court case and the trial of Warren Hastings, the first governor of Bengal, more than 200 years earlier. Hastings was impeached by the Whig MP Edmund Burke on charges of extortion, embezzlement and unlawful killing, from all of which he was ultimately exonerated. Elkins identifies that seven-year legal proceeding as the moment when the British government and its elite intellectual culture convinced itself of the principle that guided future conquests: that the means of sustaining power always justified the end. Elkins coins the term “legalised lawlessness” to describe the self-serving methods by which Britain spread the rule of law and then viciously bent it to serve imperial ends. The first half of her book examines how this hypocrisy was rooted in the supremacist underpinnings of classical liberalism, the pervasive idea that “backward” societies would be transformed by the violent application of free trade and religious education. As David Livingstone’s rallying cry had it, as he hacked through far-off jungles with that trusty machete labelled “paternal despotism”: “Christianity, commerce and civilisation!” The blood-red thread through all of that history, in Elkins’s persuasive reading, is a strain of moralising superiority that convinced successive generations of politicians, from Benjamin Disraeli to Clement Attlee, that restive subject populations must be periodically taught a lesson in the realities of “civilised” power. “The moral effect of immediate mass destruction,” as Elkins describes it. She painstakingly traces how the personnel and methodologies of suppression and torture were passed between territories, at the same time that sentimental propaganda campaigns told a different story of those conquests: from the Nobel laureateship of Kipling to the Boy’s Own potboilers of George Alfred Henty (25m copies of whose books remained in circulation in the 1950s). Her history shows how the barbarity behind imperial pomp and civilising mission statements was perfected in the long tail of empire after the first world war, an account that begins with Arthur “Bomber” Harris serving his apprenticeship wiping out villages in Mesopotamia (Iraq) in 1923. In making this case, Elkins stops short of suggesting that the outcomes of imperial ambition were uniformly hellish – “the British empire and totalitarian regimes were not the same thing, even if some eyewitnesses reported striking similarities” – but she has scant interest in the familiar “contextual” narratives of the “white man’s burden”. She writes with a distrust of the kinds of dramatic or emotional set pieces that threaten to sentimentalise this sweep of history. (It is telling that in the 50 close-typed pages of her bibliography she refers to only one volume of Jan Morris’s Pax Britannica trilogy, the books that most persuasively look for a balance between imperial ambition and brutal devastation.) In many ways, of course, this long history could not be more timely. Elkins offers an open and shut case for those who believe that Rhodes must fall. Her book should, you hope, also find its way into the hands of at least some of that 60% of the nation who, when polled in 2014, thought the British empire was, in general, “something to be proud of”.

3/13/2022,"The photographer Alex Webb believes that if you let yourself be open to the idea, you can “smell the possibility of a picture” before it happens. Your body senses an unusual or intriguing set of angles and colour and light and so “you sort of hang out a little bit and then this starts to happen over here and this starts to happen over here”, and an image resolves itself. He took this photograph travelling in Mumbai in 1981. “I wandered incessantly, trying to make visual sense of this complicated and often confounding culture,” he recalls. “Walking one morning, I glimpsed a pair of enormous eyes across the street. As I raised the camera to my eye, a child emerged from the shadows. I clicked the shutter.” That chance encounter, included in a sale of prints from the Magnum agency this week, was a pivotal image for Webb. Having worked exclusively in black and white as a young photographer, he had been experimenting with colour since travelling to Haiti and along the US border with Mexico in the late 1970s. The “grey-brown reticence” of his New England childhood didn’t begin to seem adequate for the intense colour and piercing light he had found there. His trip to India confirmed that belief. This picture was used as the cover for Webb’s glorious book The Suffering of Light. The title was derived from a quote from Goethe, “Colours are the deeds and suffering of light”, an expression of the poet’s – and Webb’s – sense that colour emerges from the emotional standoff between light and darkness. Look hard into the two sets of eyes in this picture, those of the hangings and those of the child, or into the blackness of the shadows against the painterly spectrum of clothing, and you might begin to see what they mean.

3/13/2022,"Marketers have long had a specific idea of how and where men fit into the world of beauty. They sold it to us. And we bought it. Now, that concept of what beauty products men want, need or desire has begun to shift. And thank goodness for that. Otherwise there would still be a plethora of offensive “manly” scents lurking about and the marketers would continue to indoctrinate us into believing every man wanted to be drenched in an intense waft that’s enough to make an entire train carriage nauseous. While those fragrances haven’t entirely disappeared, they are certainly less prevalent. More than ever we now have beautiful fragrances unassigned to gender, which means anyone can reach for any scent. If you smell it and you like it, wear it. The recent launch from Maison Margiela – a pink pepper, rose, patchouli and pine scent – and the Hermès classic Eau d’Orange Verte – a citrus meets moss blend – are good examples of this modern approach. Of course, the usual suspects, like beard oil, deodorant, hand cream, still have their place. The difference is, the way they look or smell is a little more inspired than their predecessors. There are some bigger shifts, too: eye creams and concealers for men. Who knew that men also actually care about the way the skin under their eyes looks and feels?

3/13/2022,"Charles Dickens’s comic novel The Pickwick Papers, often overlooked today as a lighthearted period piece, was once a matter of very serious concern to thousands of fans across the world, some of whom adopted the personas of their favourite characters and founded appreciation societies. Now the earliest proof that Mr Pickwick became central to the lives of many fans is to go on display at the Charles Dickens Museum in the novelist’s former London home in April. The Minute Book contains the official club notes of the first known Pickwick club and gives a clear picture of the way the book brought friends together to discuss the plots and debate social issues of the day. Published in monthly episodes, Dickens’s English story about a group of adventuring companions created a popular sensation and inspired clubs of readers to get together, just as international devotees of the television series Killing Eve or Peaky Blinders join online communities or follow episode blogs today. “This Minute Book, which we acquired at auction, is now one of the most fascinating items in our huge collection,” said Cindy Sughrue, the curator of the museum, speaking to the Observer before the opening of Picturing Pickwick, an exhibition about the novel and the artists who worked on it. “The first club started up in east London in 1837, while Pickwick Papers was still being serialised, and the book goes up to 1841.” Many other Pickwick clubs followed, including early groups in both Edinburgh and New Zealand and a few are still in existence today. But James Plater and his friends from Whitechapel, who were aged between 14 and 24 and largely worked in the legal profession as clerks or solicitors, are the first to have left surviving proof of their formalised club status. “They met in a local pub, although we are not sure which. The book only notes the topics of debate and the verdicts, but it gives a real sense of what was interesting to them,” said Sughrue. “They discussed whether it was ‘beneficial’ for the country to be a republic or a monarchy and they argued about whether Waterloo Bridge or London Bridge was the more attractive. They also all once voted that a tallow chandler working at Paternoster Square, near St Paul’s, was very annoying, but don’t say why.” The politics of the day were debated, with votes on the slave trade in March 1838 as well as another discussion prompted by Dickens’s own pamphlet about planned legislation to restrict public activities on a Sunday. This parliamentary bill, which was not supported by the club, would have imposed fines for leisure pursuits such as gambling and hunting. It was approved in the House of Commons, but never enacted because the King died the next week and so parliament was dissolved. “The Pickwick serial went from 500 subscriptions to 40,000 and became a huge success,” said Sughrue. “It shaped public conversation much in the way the most popular Netflix serials today do. Debating clubs inspired by the story popped up in pubs, including in the Sun Tavern near Covent Garden and at The George and Vulture [in the City of London], a pub that appears in the novel.” Interacting with fans was important to Dickens, Sughrue added, even as the 24-year-old author wrote his new episodes. He wanted to hear readers’ reactions and would then build up any fictional character that had piqued interest. “As amateur psychologists, we can now guess Dickens loved the reinforcement the clubs gave him. He sent letters to them, some of them for many years.” In 1837, Dickens wrote to welcome the foundation of the Edinburgh Pickwick Club, exclaiming, “I cannot tell you how much delight it has afforded me to hear of its existence… Mr Pickwick’s heart is among you always.” Sughrue first came across the Pickwick fan club phenomenon inside the pages of another classic, Little Women. “The March sisters are fans and they decide to set up a Pickwick club and each play a character from the book. As a literary type, Jo is Augustus Snodgrass.” Louisa May Alcott wrote Little Women in 1868, shortly after Dickens’ second reading tour of America had both begun and ended in nearby Boston. “It shows you that Pickwick appealed to women as well as men, perhaps because it made fun of the idiocies of men,” said Sughrue. And women were occasionally the subject of debates at the first Whitechapel club. The Minute Book records a positive vote on the question of whether it is possible to “die of love”. Another vote decided that “Yes, certainly,” “love is blind”. On the reason that more women than men customarily attended public executions, though, views were less decisive. “We don’t know,” the club members judged.",Arts/Books,How Dickens’ Pickwick comic serial brought his fans together,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/13/why-pickwick-was-like-peaky-it-brought-dickens-devotees-together
3/13/2022,"A UK charity set up to support one of Russia’s oldest theatres has closed. The Anglo-Russian Opera and Ballet Trust, founded in 1992, raised millions for Russian arts organisations and boasted the Prince of Wales as its patron. The charity was set up by conductor Valery Gergiev, a high-profile friend of Vladimir Putin, with the main goal of supporting St Petersburg’s Mariinsky theatre – one of the best-known cultural institutions in Russia – and promoting its work in the UK. It raised money for Mariinsky artists including Xander Parish, an East Yorkshire-born ballet star who joined the Mariinsky in 2010 and later became one of its principal dancers. Now, weeks shy of its 30-year milestone in April, the trust has been disbanded. References to it have been removed from the list of Prince Charles’s affiliations on official royal websites, and the charity’s website now carries the message: “The Mariinsky Theatre Trust [its working name] has closed down.” The charity – whose trustees include BP’s former vice-president for Russia, Peter Charow, Labour MP Nick Brown and Elizabeth Smith, the life peer and widow of the former Labour leader – has not released a statement explaining the closure, but the move came days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A day earlier, Gergiev, the Mariinsky’s director and one of Russia’s biggest classical music stars, was dropped by La Scala opera house in Milan after he failed to denounce the invasion. He has since resigned as honorary president of the Edinburgh international festival and been fired by the Munich Philharmonic. The 68-year-old composer has been described as “fiercely loyal” to Putin, whom he reportedly meets five or six times a year, and expressed support for Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Putin, who has called Gergiev “one of the outstanding musicians of our time”, pumped an estimated $700m into a new opera and ballet house, the Mariinsky II, which opened in 2013. According to its website, the Anglo-Russian Opera and Ballet Trust was created by Gergiev and combined “practical assistance for the Mariinsky theatre’s work in Russia with active promotion of its most innovative programming in the UK”. Prince Charles became its patron in 1999, and went on to be photographed alongside Gergiev in 2001. Musicians from the Mariinsky performed at his wedding to Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005. The Charity Commission for England and Wales said that it had not yet been asked to remove the trust from its register, but last week the charity’s number had been disconnected and emails went unanswered. Trustees were contacted for comment. A spokesperson for the Prince of Wales declined to comment, but confirmed that the trust had closed. This is the latest instance of the UK cutting ties to Russian cultural institutions after the invasion of Ukraine. Opera and ballet performances have been cancelled throughout the UK, including a planned residency by Moscow’s Bolshoi Ballet at the Royal Opera House in London. In St Petersburg, the show at the Mariinsky goes on, with performances of Swan Lake and operas by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Rossini among those scheduled for this month. But last week, Parish, the ballet company’s star and first British dancer, announced his departure. The 35-year-old, who was awarded an OBE in 2017 for his services to dance and UK-Russia relations, said in a social media post on Monday that due to the “awful crisis” he had decided to leave Russia, “at least until peace comes”. He added that he was “so grateful to the Mariinsky”, which had given him “a career in classical ballet I could only have dreamed about”, and paid tribute to “wonderful ordinary Russian people, the majority of whom have treated me with such kindness. “I pray that peace will come and the wounds will be healed by God’s grace. My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.”",News/World news,Charity that supported St Petersburg ballet and opera closes its doors,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/charity-that-supported-st-petersburg-ballet-and-opera-closes-its-doors
3/13/2022,"Four-fifths of British homes are heated by gas and almost half of our electricity is produced by burning gas. British energy policy, in thrall to the notion that the market never makes mistakes and governments always do, has left us uniquely exposed to the more than doubling in gas prices first driven by Covid and now by the war in Ukraine. British households spent £36bn on gas consumption in 2021-22, according to energy consultants Aurora Energy Research. They project this will rise to £74bn in the next financial year 2022-23 – a rise of £38bn. Put another way, the average household will have paid £1,277 a year to this April for its gas, when the price cap will be lifted, and then more than £3,000 in October. These are unparalleled swingeing increases. Of course the government should have insisted on more diversified sources of supply, intensified the transition to renewables and accelerated rather than turned back the improved insulation of our homes. The country is paying a huge price for the government’s blind faith in the wisdom of markets. The question is what to do now. However, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has signalled that he intends to do nothing in the spring statement on 23 March. Instead, he will stand by the measures he has already put in place – a £200 discount in every household’s energy bill earmarked for October this year that will be recovered in annual £40 instalments over the next five years, along with a non-repayable £150 rebate in council tax payments for homes in bands A to D. In the context of energy bills that are expected to rise by approaching £2,000 in six months, this is nugatory, mean in its thinking and self-defeating in practice. It is part and parcel with Sunak’s wider approach. In the next financial year, the rate of inflation alone is projected to be 4% higher than the forecasts on which cash spending was calculated at the time of the autumn statement in 2021. His do-nothing inclination will be to ask departments to keep within that cash envelope, so there will be an enormous cut in real terms for the delivery of services and the pay of public sector workers – as savage as any imposed at the height of austerity. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that just keeping public sector pay level in real terms would mean expanding the spending by £10bn in 2022-23. There is enough cash. Energy companies are now receiving an enormous unearned boost to their income – not from enterprise, hard work or initiative but because Putin launched his war. Following the EU’s lead, a windfall profits tax should be levied on them, which would raise approaching £10bn. More generally, the chancellor’s plans to freeze allowances for four years from 2022-23 will mean a spectacular increase in income tax receipts. Sitting on a potential revenue bonanza and on top of having the option to borrow 25-, 50- and even 100-year debt, the chancellor has a unique opportunity to alleviate potential economic and social distress. The energy rebate in October should be lifted to £1,000 per household with no requirement for repayment. He should commit to maintain public spending in real terms. And he should counter recession by supporting levelling up and the green transition, committing substantial resources for both. Hoarding his cash for pre-election tax cuts, pretending that his hands are fiscally tied, is cynical, deceitful and wrong.

3/13/2022,"I read an interview with a fashion stylist who said she never wears foundation (or makeup), just lipstick. She looked terrific. So for a split second, I was tempted by her ethos. But then I came to my senses. Not everything works for everybody. Some need a little less and some of us need quite a lot more. But we all want to look effortless, right? So cheat. A tinted moisturiser (with a hint of blush) is a really great way to fake that “radiating skin health” face.

The efficacy of your cleanser will determine how well the rest of your skincare performs. A cleanser that doesn’t take your makeup off properly or tampers with your skin barrier or is too oily, drying or harsh will negate the effectiveness of any skincare product that comes afterwards. Ideally you need a roster of cleansers; a balm or oil should always be on tap – great for winter, for drier skins and works as a good makeup remover. But that’s an ideal situation. In real life most people use one cleanser. Well, I can highly recommend this superfood-infused one by Youth To The People. Most people would be immediately sold on the name. And thankfully it doesn’t disappoint. A cleanser shouldn’t be overly scented – if at all – and the fresh green scent of this is barely perceptible. The gel texture feels heavenly on the skin and it works up a rather reassuring foam that always feels comfortable. The end result is clean skin that isn’t stripped of moisture, so your skin is balanced and primed to absorb your serums and moisturisers. This really should be the essential function of any product that calls itself a cleanser. Alas, this is not always the case. So even if you only have this cleanser in your roster, your skin will be in very good hands.
