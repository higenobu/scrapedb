4/9/2022,"There may not have been any good times to have been mentally ill in the last 200 years, but there have been some spectacularly bad ones. Having all your teeth pulled out to end your “madness” might seem as extreme as it gets, but if you were unfortunate enough to be under the care of Dr Henry Cotton in the early decades of the 20th century, there was a real risk that your intestines might follow. If you were female your cervix was a potential victim, too. Unsurprisingly, survival was not guaranteed, no one got better, and quality of life for those who lived was severely curtailed. Fast forward a few years, past the insulin-induced coma treatment and the frequent administration of electric shock therapy (several times a day), and you might also want to avoid Dr Walter Freeman, who wielded a modified ice-pick to lobotomise up to 20 patients in one session. Hardly surprising, perhaps, that those who could afford it turned to psychoanalysis – often painful itself, but in a very different way. Andrew Scull’s book, which tells the story of mental illness in the US over the past two centuries, is dominated by extremes and hopes. It is meticulously researched and beautifully written, and even funny at times, despite the harrowing content. This is a history of serious mental illness – schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression – and there is no happy ending. But among psychiatrists there is considerable and diverse striving to understand causes, discover remedies and, frankly, make patients easier to manage. While each wave of medical professionals seems to think they have achieved these elusive goals, they are largely doomed to disappointment and often disgrace. At times their egos fly much higher than their ideas, but perhaps that is human nature, and maybe it is necessary. Without ambition and mistakes, we would never achieve very much. For some there is an almost frenzied hope of success, but whether for the benefit of patients or personal aggrandisement, it isn’t always clear. The attempt to elucidate mental illness’s biological underpinnings has driven much of this experimentation. If these could be revealed, then psychiatrists were real doctors, and real cures might be found. But in this context, the patients who were lost to “cutting-edge” treatments, or simply to appalling care, hardly seem like people – something of which Scull is painfully and compassionately aware. More often than not they are women, and seem to have been regarded as expendable. Scull, as a sociologist, is not entirely sympathetic to psychiatry and psychiatrists. It’s right that he doesn’t spare them, and as the book draws to a close, he writes passionately of the need for a broader approach, embracing more than the currently dominant biological paradigm. His analysis of prevailing diagnoses and their links with pharmacological treatments is sceptical, but he also acknowledges the vital relief of symptoms that can be provided by some medicines and modified ECT. He asks for caution, honesty, humility, and, above all, for understanding. This book is an unfinished story, and I would very much like to know what happens in the sequel. What we have seen up to now is a rollercoaster of emotion, with many casualties strewn along the way. It is easy to recoil in horror when reading of the treatments and asylum conditions of the early 20th century, but we judge by our own standards, and will ourselves be judged by those of the future. Mental illness is something we all fear, in ourselves and others, and those who experience it are often disempowered in their interactions with specialists. One hopes we are showing more kindness now than in the past, but Scull is right in saying that we have a long way to go.  Rebecca Lawrence is a consultant psychiatrist.

4/9/2022,"Long queues at Sydney airport’s domestic terminals have continued for a third day, with some passengers missing international connections, as the airport warns delays resulting from a surge in travellers and a shortfall in security staff could continue for weeks. Chaotic scenes were reported in the departure halls as early as 4.30am on Saturday, with some frustrated travellers, many of whom heeded the pleas of airport chiefs to arrive at least two hours before their domestic flight was due to take off, claiming only one security line was operating. @SydneyAirport arrived at terminal 2 at 4.30am for a 6am flight… security line out the door, no way I’ll make my flight. One line. One security check in line working. That’s just poor planning on your part. While the queues that formed early on Saturday are understood to have cleared later in the morning, the airport apologised to affected travellers. “Traffic numbers are picking up and the close contact rules are making it hard to fill shifts and staff the airport. We appreciate your patience,” Sydney airport said on its Twitter account. A wave of families travelling as the term two school holidays begin this weekend, combined with close contact rules that are understood to be taking out about 20% of security shifts in any given day, are driving the problem. Certis, the company that Sydney airport contracts for its security operations, is desperately trying to recruit personnel, while the airport has reallocated back office, IT and retail workers to the departure hall to comb queues so they can prioritise passengers at risk of missing their flight. Hell is… this at 5am.🤦🏻 @SydneyAirport @JetstarAirways pic.twitter.com/Gq8VaKD5Az “We are working around the clock to resolve these issues and have teams in the terminals bringing passengers forward in order of priority,” a Sydney airport spokesperson said. He added that the airport is “anticipating it will [be] busy right through the school holiday period and peak over the Easter and Anzac Day weekends, in some cases at 90% of pre-Covid passenger levels”. “We’re deeply grateful to passengers for their ongoing patience and we’re sorry to everyone who has been inconvenienced,” the spokesperson said. “We would also like to thank passengers for getting to the airport early and treating staff and each other with kindness and respect.” The Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce was forced to clarify comments he made on Friday that passengers were “not match fit” and that those forgetting to remove laptops and aerosols from their bags at the security check contributing to the delays. “Just to be clear, I’m not ‘blaming’ passengers,” Joyce said. “Of course it’s not their fault,” he said. Qantas shed thousands of staff during the pandemic, and outsourced ground crews in a decision that was challenged in court. On Saturday, Qantas also apologised to a Melbourne family left stranded in Sydney, after domestic flight delays caused them to miss an international trip. Javiera Martinez, her partner Daniel Capurro and their three children were supposed to be flying to Chile on Friday to visit relatives they had not seen in three years. But after their 8am Qantas flight from Melbourne was delayed by half an hour, baggage handling and airport transfer delays in Sydney meant they couldn’t make their 11.30am LATAM Airlines flight to Santiago. Martinez said the airline’s procedures at the airport were chaotic. “We think Qantas didn’t behave appropriately. I got berated by the person at the counter – they never apologised, they never assumed any responsibility at all,” she said. “It was a rude conversation. We have been mistreated badly I would say.” The PCR tests they need to travel have now expired and they will have to take them again as they wait for seats on the next flight to Santiago from Sunday. The airline has apologised and paid for a night’s accommodation in Sydney. “We sincerely apologise that the family missed their connecting flight on another airline due to delays moving through Sydney airport on Friday,” a Qantas spokesperson said. The family is among many affected by hold ups amid the busiest travel period in two years, with Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane airports warning passengers to arrive two hours before domestic flights.",News/Australia news,Sydney airport warns delays could last weeks on third day of travel chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/sydney-airport-warns-delays-could-last-weeks-on-third-day-of-travel-chaos
4/9/2022,"Rio Tinto investors have voted against the company’s financial statements over a lack of clarity about climate change risks at the mining giant’s London annual general meeting. Ahead of the vote, investment management firm Sarasin & Partners declared its intention to vote against the company’s financial statements, against keeping accounting firm KPMG on as auditor and questioned the performance of the company’s audit committee. A note from the firm’s head of stewardship, Natasha Landell-Mills, said Rio Tinto had not disclosed key material about how it would transition to a zero carbon economy. “While Rio has increased its discussion of climate risks and made clear that its accounts are not 1.5C aligned, thereby providing welcome transparency, it does not provide disclosures on its quantitative assumptions, or visibility as to how it would be impacted if its own stated goal to be 1.5C-aligned were achieved,” Landell-Mills said. The note did not say the firm was voting against the company’s climate statement. Auditors are essential to making investment decisions and any failure to identify, discuss and disclose whether a company is able to meet its climate commitments, and the risk of stranded assets, means investors will be left on the hook. Rio Tinto’s largest source of carbon emissions are scope 3 emissions – the emissions created by assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organisations. As the smelters responsible for turning its iron ore into steel operate in China, Japan and South Korea, and are not owned by the company, the mining giant has so far resisted placing a target on scope 3 emissions. But investors have been increasingly putting pressure on the company to act. An assessment by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) of Rio Tinto’s climate statement found that despite progress elsewhere, the company was not doing enough these emissions. It also found Rio Tinto maintained memberships in industry associations that lobbied against climate action. Dan Gocher, ACCR director of climate and environment, said that as the company does not disclose the voting numbers from its London and Australian AGMs, it was difficult to tell the exact level of opposition. “There’s likely to have been some investor opposition to Rio Tinto’s climate report overnight primarily because Rio has not set targets for scope 3 emissions, which it has resisted for many years,” Gocher said. “It did, however, make very significant commitments at the end of 2021 to reduce its operational emissions and allocated significant capital expenditure to achieve that.” Gary Walker, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace Australia, said it was “absolutely wild” that how investors voted was not publicly disclosed. “Transparency is critical,” Walker said. “There should be an open record on who votes on what at AGM and shareholder meetings so we can hold investors to account for their climate commitments.” Walker said this year would mark a test for investors and auditing firms about how genuine they are in their commitment to assessing climate risk and acting to mitigate it. Following investor discontent in the UK, he said Rio Tinto was on notice ahead of its general meeting in a month – along with the rest of corporate Australia. He said that a vote scheduled in two months by AGL seeking permission from its shareholders to split its coal assets into a separate company was a critical moment for firms that have signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. “We’ve seen a lot of nice statements, but this is where the rubber hits the road,” Walker said. “It’s a real big test for these investors and their auditors over their climate commitments. “Our view is they shouldn’t let the demerger proceed because they want to keep burning coal to 2045.” Rio Tinto was contacted for comment.",News/Business,Rio Tinto investors vote against financial statements in climate protest,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/09/rio-tinto-investors-vote-against-financial-statements-in-climate-protest

4/9/2022,"The living room of the small two-bedroom apartment in Staten Island – sometimes called New York City’s “forgotten borough” – is overflowing with office supplies, mail, red union stickers, and flyers with information about unions. It seems almost unbelievable that amid this chaos, and armed with just $120,000 that they raised on GoFundMe, its occupants, Amazon workers Brett Daniels and Connor Spence, helped successfully unionize workers at the nearby gargantuan 855,000-square-foot Amazon warehouse – the first of the company’s warehouses in the US to vote for a union. “This is a monstrous win for the working class,” said Daniels. “The Amazon Labor Union showed what seemed impossible is possible.” The apartment in a two-floor suburban house was the headquarters from which Amazon workers pulled off one of the biggest wins for US unions in decades. Beating Amazon’s multimillion-dollar efforts to stop them organizing involved tireless organizing, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook and a lot of free homemade food. But most of all, said 29-year-old Julian Mitchell-Israel, an Amazon worker and one of the original organizers with the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), they listened. “It’s not that we’ve established a new model of organizing here,” said Mitchell-Israel. “The model is listening and highlighting people’s stories, and when we build a platform, using it to lift up their stories, because that’s what’s been compelling for the workers, that’s what’s gotten people to vote yes.” Amazon Labor Union defied the odds without any affiliation to national labor unions and precious little support from the political class which has seen other efforts to organize at Amazon rebuffed. The surprise victory has been hailed as historic in the US media, and its organizers have been bombarded with interview requests from around the world. Elected officials and prominent figures have issued public declarations of support, including Joe Biden and several members of Congress, all attention that had been lacking leading up to the vote as most media outlets and elected officials, including ostensible supporters of labor unionizing efforts, ignored the ALU’s efforts. The union has also received inquiries from Amazon workers at warehouses and delivery stations around the US and internationally, requesting assistance and asserting interest in organizing unions at their own work sites. There are meetings scheduled with New York elected officials in Albany and with Sean O’Brien, president of the powerful Teamsters union, who has also pledged to unionize Amazon. For Mitchell-Israel the noise is distracting attention from how ALU achieved its victory. “There’s just so much talk about this union in a way that, I think, abstracts it and makes it into a phenomenon that it’s not. It’s just people and stories and love and necessity, and that’s what it comes down to,” he said. “You go and you listen and rather than telling them they should vote yes, telling them here’s how you organize, you just ask them the right questions, and people will come up with their own answers to it. People have different answers, and because they’re the workers, they’re the ones being affected, it’s going to be the right answer.” With more than 1 million employees in the US, Amazon is the country’s second largest private employer. The company has faced public scrutiny for years over workers reporting abhorrent working conditions, high injury rates, and immense productivity pressures, which have contributed to annual turnover rates of about 150%. On Staten Island the Covid-19 pandemic brought the clash between Amazon and its workers to a head. ALU founder Chris Smalls, then as assistant manager at Amazon, helped lead a walkout in March 2020 over lack of Covid-19 protections and was fired shortly after. Leaked memos showed Amazon executives denigrating Smalls as “not smart or articulate” in a meeting with the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, and suggesting it would be a win for them if they made him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement”. “Welp there you go!” Smalls tweeted last week. @amazon wanted to make me the face of the whole unionizing efforts against them…. welp there you go! @JeffBezos @DavidZapolsky CONGRATULATIONS 🎉 @amazonlabor We worked had fun and made History ‼️✊🏾 #ALU # ALUfortheWin welcome the 1st union in America for Amazon 🔥🔥🔥🔥 “The workers that I organize with are like my family now,” Smalls told the Guardian. “To bring this victory to them is the best feeling in the world next to my kids’ birth.” Smalls’s story proved a powerful one on Staten Island. “When I do talk to workers, I tell them I was fired wrongfully because I tried to protect workers’ health and safety, and that can happen to you,” Smalls said after helping to form the group. “You can complain or submit a grievance, and they could just terminate you or target you to be terminated, or retaliate against you. And there’s no protection, so the only way we’re going to be protected is by forming that union.” The ALU’s fight is far from over. Organizers are currently bracing for the upcoming union election at the LDJ5 sorting center in Staten Island, which begins on 25 April, and cementing resources, such as finding office space, ahead of the fight to negotiate a first union contract with Amazon, which continues to vehemently oppose unions. The tech company may have lost this battle but it continues the fight. “We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” said Amazon in response to the union win. “We’re evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB that we and others (including the National Retail Federation and US Chamber of Commerce) witnessed in this election.” Shortly after the union victory, internal documents leaked to the Intercept revealed a planned internal messaging app for employees would block the use of words or phrases such as “union”, “pay raises”, “living wage” or “representation”. Amazon has a record of firing workers involved in organizing activities and automatically terminating workers for minor infractions, including Jason Anthony, a picker at JFK8 on Staten Island and a labor organizer and founding member of ALU. In the summer of 2020, Anthony was automatically fired from Amazon when his unpaid time off went in the red. He had run out of his prescription medications and transportation to the warehouse was limited due to Covid-19 restrictions and staffing issues with public transit. Anthony had to wait over a year to be able to get rehired, but currently has a case being investigated with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about Amazon’s alleged lack of accommodations for workers with mental disabilities. He is currently on short-term disability leave from a back injury sustained at Amazon during peak season in December 2021. He has known Chris Smalls from long before Smalls emerged as a celebrity in the US labor movement. “Chris was the best person you could work with. He cared about his employees from a human perspective, not just as a manager,” said Anthony, “When he got fired in 2020, I went to the building to support him and when I got fired several months later, I called him and asked him for his support, so since then, we developed a brotherhood that will never ever be broken. We could argue, have internal disagreements here and there, but at the end of the day we always come together.” Now the ALU will begin its negotiations with Amazon with the aim of improving working conditions, pay, breaks and their lives as workers. The union plans on building out these efforts in the US and abroad at Amazon. New York is a union town and replicating the Staten Island victory may prove difficult across the US. Another effort to organize in Alabama hangs in the balance with Amazon currently ahead in the votes. But Anthony is convinced change is coming. “This victory is only the beginning of a global revolution,” he said.",News/Technology,‘The model is listening’: union’s win at Amazon hatched in a small apartment,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/09/amazon-union-organization-staten-island
4/9/2022,"You’ve put your shopping in the basket, visited the checkout and handed over your payment – so it might be a bit of a surprise if the cost of your groceries later goes up. That’s exactly what can happen when you shop online with some of the big grocery chains. You may not have realised it, but at some supermarkets the prices shown online when you check out your trolley are “guide prices” that can not be relied upon. At a time when the UK is experiencing record high levels of food price inflation, not knowing how much you are actually going to have to pay for your groceries until after you have agreed to buy them may be a worrying prospect. One Sainsbury’s customer who uses a wheelchair and shops online wrote on Twitter recently that “sneakily increasing” prices at the point of delivery feels “discriminatory”. “I’m disabled, I can’t do a full weekly shop in store,” she tweeted. “When I check out online, for a set price, I expect that to be what I actually pay, not for them to go up literally overnight.” Her case highlights a detail in Sainsbury’s terms and conditions that allows it to change prices before delivery. It’s something about which its customers, and those of some other retailers, need to be aware. “When doing a supermarket shop online, customers are often given an estimated price for fresh produce – such as fruit and vegetables – and then charged for what the item costs when weighed in store on the day,” says Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?. He points out that if items cost significantly more than expected when shopping online or you receive substitutions which aren’t suitable, you can opt to return them on the doorstep. “It’s essential that supermarkets are upfront about their terms and conditions and if prices or special offers could change on the day of delivery,” he adds. Last month Morrisons started applying an extra 5% charge to online orders, explaining to customers that this is a “payment deposit” to “allow for any changes at delivery or collection that could alter your order total”. This is added to your card after the checkout price is calculated and not included in the total you are shown. When contacted by Guardian Money, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose all said they displayed only guide prices online. It is only after “loose weight” items, typically fresh food, are actually chosen, weighed and delivered that the “final amount” of an online customer’s basket can be accurately calculated, the supermarkets say. However, the variation in the final amount you pay can also reflect changes in the prices of goods you are buying that have occurred between the day of ordering and the day of delivery. Prices may also be affected by promotions, which are valid when you place the order but expire before the date of delivery, or substitutions for unavailable items, depending on the policy of the supermarket. The food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe said on social media that changing online prices “feels obscene” to her: “They [supermarkets] should honour the price at the point of ordering – surely the price factors in whether you order something or not?” she wrote. Tesco states on its website that its prices are “guide prices only” and the actual prices you pay will be those charged in store at the time your order is picked for delivery. As a result, prices can vary “marginally” between checkout and delivery, a spokesperson said. Sainsbury’s makes a similar statement about showing only guide prices online in its terms and conditions, describing the prices you see in “my basket” as “estimates only.” Both supermarkets told Guardian Money that the price online shoppers pay is the same they would pay if they shopped in-store on the day of delivery. Sainsbury’s added that because prices are regularly reviewed, “customers can end up paying less, too.” Waitrose also states online in its terms and conditions that “prices quoted are always estimated … you will always be charged the in-store price on the day of delivery or collection.” However, the supermarket told us that promotional price changes are “typically updated” in its online system in advance, and the website will use the date of your delivery to show you the “most accurate prices”. This means that if you choose a delivery slot at Waitrose before you start to fill your trolley, you may find you are shown more “accurate” prices and the correct “special offers” for the items you are selecting than if you choose a delivery slot later, after filling your trolley. Either way, the supermarket will attempt to anticipate and factor in promotional price changes which have not yet happened in store – but will by the date of your delivery – before you check out. Ocado, Morrisons and Asda use online guide prices, but only for products with a variable weight – for example fresh meat, or vegetables if you have chosen how many you want. So if the product you end up receiving in your delivery has a higher than average weight, you may be charged more than the guide price given online at the time of your order. Equally, if the product you receive weighs less than average, you will be charged less. In March, Morrisons introduced a temporary 5% holding charge, which is levied on the day before delivery, while the supermarket is waiting to calculate the final total you must pay for these variable weight products, plus any extra charges for substitutions. It will eventually release any money you don’t spend. The total price that you see at the end of the checkout process reflects only the prices of the products you are buying, and does not include the temporary 5% charge, although a spokesperson says customers are informed of it in advance. Morrisons says: “After you can no longer edit your order the day before your order is due, we will attempt to authorise your bank for this amount. This means your bank will hold the money and you can’t spend it. We will calculate the final total after delivery or collection and only charge you that amount.” Other than for loose weight products and substitutions that cost more than the original product you ordered, the price you pay at Morrisons is what you see on the website when you add it to your basket and check out. “If prices change between checkout and delivery, then the customer is not charged an increased price – they pay the price of the item at checkout,” the spokesperson says. Asda said that, apart from loose items priced by weight, “we don’t change our prices once an order has been placed [and] we don’t operate a holding charge of any kind. We do this as we know that a lot of our customers budget very carefully and it would be frustrating for prices to change once an order has already been placed.” An Ocado spokesperson says it does not apply a holding charge either and, apart from loose weight items, “what you see in your basket is what you pay”. All the supermarkets contacted by Guardian Money say that customers receive their receipt with the final prices before their orders arrive and items can always be returned to the delivery driver for a refund.",Lifestyle/Money,Shoppers shocked as supermarkets’ online prices jump after ordering,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/09/shoppers-shocked-as-supermarkets-online-prices-jump-after-ordering
4/9/2022,"It’s 2022 and the only thing you’re legally allowed to make documentaries about is sport or murder. Personally, I am fine with this: we’ve lived through a boom period of sporting documentaries, from BBC’s excellent Gods of Snooker to HBO’s Tiger to Amazon Prime’s All or Nothing and Netflix’s so-good-it-reinvigorated-an-entire-sport Drive to Survive – all-encompassing works that tell the stories around those perfect sporting moments that grab the headlines, that feed our endless fascination with elite athletes who are capable of the extraordinary. I suppose sports and murder documentaries have their similarities: basically, we love looking at a black-and-white photo of an innocent child then asking: “How could they possibly have done what they did?”, whether it’s about a championship-winning moment or a full chest freezer discovered by armed police. To Paul Gascoigne, then, who you’ll remember from the entirety of the 1990s. We only get a glimmer of it from archive footage early in episode one of Gazza (Wednesday, BBC Two), but it’s easy to forget what an astonishing footballer he was: a line-breaking visionary passer with the gluey first touch of a dribbler and the upper body strength of an entire rugby scrum. The beats of Gascoigne’s story – an idol at his boyhood club, the pride of Italia 90, scoring that free kick against Arsenal, an FA Cup final knee injury, then Lazio, Euro 96, Rangers and missing out on the 98 World Cup squad – are well-worn by now, but the documentary-makers have done a good job of sifting through those little half-clips of unseen footage (though there is a lot of “bleach-blond Gazza gurning at the camera while eating crisps” going on) to help the story feel not “new” exactly but “new-ish”. Sadly, Gazza suffers from the same problem actual Gazza did: far too many opinions from people in the media. It’s not just the way Gascoigne played football that felt out of time, but the way he was elevated to the pantheon of superstardom then torn down as soon as he stepped out of the moral strictures the newspapers decided for him: we’ve seen it since with David Beckham, Wayne Rooney and Raheem Sterling. That could have been an interesting parallel to Gascoigne’s football career – a decade-and-a-half long “what if?” story, arguably one of sport’s most frustrating, but also evidence that the halcyon glare of the 90s tabloid spotlight had as much ability to destroy as it did to celebrate, and maybe that was the point all along – if it wasn’t told by, well, the journalists who did it. So: we hear from Jane Nottage, Gascoigne’s former assistant from his days in Italy, who went on to sell a tell-all book that shattered his trust in strangers. We hear from Graham Johnson, introduced on-screen as “Journalist, News of the World, convicted of phone hacking at the Sunday Mirror”, who calls Gascoigne and his wife Sheryl a “tabloid fairytale”. Over footage of Gascoigne’s first stay in rehab, former News of the World journalist Paul McMullan explains how Gascoigne’s diagnosed paranoia wasn’t paranoia at all, because his newspaper was hanging mobile phones from various trees in an effort to listen to him. Greg Miskiw, arrested as part of Operation Weeting, calls Gascoigne “easy meat”. We hear a little from England teammates Paul Ince and Paul Merson, but much less than, say, convicted former journalists. We do not hear from Gascoigne himself, though we get a nice slow-mo shot of him fishing, which I guess makes up for the 22-year period between Middlesbrough and now that the documentary ignores entirely. Gazza feels, then, like a documentary about the “dark arts” of tabloid phone hacking that is endlessly hamstrung by having to show footage of a footballer playing football. Swathes of the second episode of this two-parter go by without a ball being kicked, and you start to suspect that it could have worked as one episode of a multi-part documentary investigating how the lawless 90s tabloids impinged on the lives of Hugh Grant, Liam Gallagher, Ulrika Jonsson and Princess Diana, but someone in commissioning decided nah let’s not do that, and now what we have instead is a documentary that says: “Look how bad it is when the media covers people insensitively!” while sort of doing the same thing itself. Let me put it this way: it’s incredibly strange to watch a two-hour documentary that starts with a geordie doing kick-ups and ends with an explanation of Rebekah Brooks’s entire editorial career. There is more to Paul Gascoigne than one free-kick, a nightclub knee injury and the fact that he knew Chris Evans. This documentary doesn’t get anywhere close to unearthing that.",Arts/Television & radio,Gazza: The strange Paul Gascoigne show that’s obsessed with the people who destroyed him,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/09/gazza-the-strange-paul-gascoigne-show-thats-obsessed-with-the-people-who-destroyed-him
4/9/2022,"It took a single stroke of Ron DeSantis’s pen, passing Florida’s so-called “don’t say gay” bill into law, to transform the self-proclaimed happiest place on earth into a scene of bitter conflict. Disney’s theme parks have become the latest battlefront in the pugnacious rightwing Republican governor’s culture war on what he calls “wokeness”, and on the state’s LBGTQ+ community. DeSantis, a close Trump ally, and perhaps rival, is threatening sanctions on the corporate behemoth after it dared to challenge the controversial law banning discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms. DeSantis, however, is no comedic Disney villain doomed to lose and be taught the error of his ways before peace is restored to the kingdom. The ambitious Trumpist governor, many observers say, has sights set on his own presidential run in 2024, and doesn’t care if he tramples Florida’s largest private employer and its notably diverse cast of almost 80,000 to get there. Or if he upends the tradition of decades of special privilege Disney has enjoyed in Florida in return for the tens of millions of dollars it has spent on political lobbying and campaign contributions. Those perks include the right to self-government, granted to Disney by the Florida legislature in 1967 when the Magic Kingdom was under construction in Orlando, and which vocal DeSantis loyalists are now seeking to repeal in order to punish the company. “He’s running in a GOP primary for president of the United States, which is the motivating factor behind every single decision that he makes,” Carlos Guillermo Smith, an openly gay Democratic member of the Florida house, said. “This doesn’t make Floridians better off, unfortunately. It’s all about Ron DeSantis, what he wants, and what helps his political future. They are [also] abusing their power and trying to scare Floridians and businesses away from expressing any support for the LGBTQ community. “We have major problems in Florida, and Governor DeSantis seems more interested in settling scores and seeking retribution against people who don’t agree with his agenda.” DeSantis’s feud with Disney has escalated in recent days following the company’s statement that it would work to repeal the law, which experts say stigmatizes gay and transgender people, and could harm children’s mental health and lead to suicides. Last week, the governor appeared to back the proposal by Spencer Roach, a Republican state congressman, to cancel the 1967 agreement, which allowed the company to build then operate Disney World autonomously. Disney, DeSantis said, had “crossed the line” by committing to help overturn the “don’t say gay” law, officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Act, and that it was time for Disney’s “special privileges” to end. “They’re used to having their way, and they’re not used to having people that will stand in their way,” DeSantis said at a press conference in St Johns county. “Actually, the state of Florida’s going to be governed by the best interests of the people in Florida. We’re certainly not going to bend the knee to woke executives in California,” he added, referring to Disney’s corporate headquarters in Burbank. In an email to the Guardian, DeSantis’s spokesperson, Christina Pushaw, denied DeSantis was seeking “retaliation” over Disney for its stance. “For his entire political career, his position has always been that all businesses should be able to compete on a fair playing field, and that it’s wrong for governments to dole out favors to politically connected companies,” she said. But records show that Disney, which announced last month it was suspending all political donations in the state as the “don’t say gay” bill progressed, contributed almost $1m to the Republican party of Florida in 2020, and $50,000 directly to DeSantis. Meanwhile, an analysis compiled by Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state congresswoman representing Disney’s central Florida heartland, lists decades of perks and privileges she says the company has enjoyed from lawmakers. They feature millions of dollars in sales and property tax breaks, corporate income tax refunds, and language inserted into, or left out of certain legislation that would affect the company, including a human trafficking bill that could have exposed its hotels to lawsuits, and an exemption to regulations over materials used in road construction on Disney property. “The governor hasn’t held the company accountable beyond yelling about it on Fox News,” said Eskamani, who stressed that she accepts no corporate campaign contributions. “Disney’s business model, and tax structures, have remained unchanged, and even the governor’s office has helped Disney maintain special privileges. So much of this I find to be ironic. “But that’s not what he’s talking about. He’s talking about specific, punitive punishments of one company because they dare speak out against a homophobic and transphobic bill because they have LGBTQ+ employees who are scared for their health and wellbeing. “[Disney] needs to recruit and retain diverse staff and will not be able to do that the direction Florida is going. As economic partners they have every right to express themselves, but under the DeSantis administration, if you dare challenge him, he will bully you into submission.” Pushback on DeSantis has also come from Republicans. Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, told CNN: “The whole thing seems like just a crazy fight. The bill was kind of absurd and not something that would have happened in our state.” For its part, Disney appears to have been caught wrong-footed by the furore. The company was accused of voicing its opposition late, and issuing its statement only after an outcry and walkout by cast members. Chief executive Bob Chapek apologized for “pain, frustration and sadness” caused by its earlier silence in a letter aimed at its LBGTQ+ workers. “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down,” he wrote. The misstep also allowed DeSantis to seize on perceived “dishonesty” by Disney, which employs dozens of lobbyists in Tallahassee but did not use them to speak with lawmakers as the law was drafted. “They didn’t seem to have a problem with it when it was going through. This was such an affront, why weren’t they speaking up at the outset?” DeSantis said. In a further blow to Disney’s attempts to make amends, the Human Rights Campaign is refusing a $5m donation until the company proves its commitment to work with LGBTQ+ advocates to overturn the “don’t say gay” law. Disney did not respond to emails seeking comment. “Disney is caught between a rock and a hard place,” said Charles Zelden, professor of humanities and politics at Nova Southeastern University and a longtime Florida Disney watcher. “I suspect their lobbyists told them, ‘You know, keep quiet on this’ and that’s what they tried to do, but then they couldn’t because the cast members rose up and said, ‘You got to object to this’. They can’t afford to alienate not only their cast members but people who support a more liberal, diverse society.” Zelden said he was curious about DeSantis’s next move. “Disney has all these lobbyists to make sure they don’t lose their special taxing district. So it just means that the fight will progress into the legislature, and they’ve got a heck of a tool with their money and their clout to fend off concrete attacks,” he said. “The verbal attacks will continue, but as long as it stays that way, the Mouse is all right.”",News/US news,DeSantis takes on Disney in latest battle in the Republican culture war,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/09/ron-desantis-disney-republican-culture-war

4/9/2022,"The Adelaide Crows are the 2022 AFLW premiers after defeating the Melbourne Demons 4.5 (29) to 2.4 (16) in a gripping contest amid wild scenes at Adelaide Oval. Chasing their third flag, the Crows were just a bit tougher and a cleaner all game, and despite a third quarter rally from Melbourne, the home team ran out worthy winners when Danielle Ponter broke away and goaled to seal it for Adelaide. A dejected Melbourne captain Daisy Pearce, who was rumoured to be playing her final game in a glittering career, told her vanquishers: “We knew it would take a bloody good team to beat us, and that’s what you were.” In a torrid opening quarter, the backlines of both sides duelled for early honours. However it was the Crows who looked better organised and when Jas Hewitt took a ripping grab on the goal line Adelaide opened their account. The Dees could take heart from denying Adelaide’s champion Erin Phillips a possession all quarter… until, seconds before the siren, the Crows legend swooped and snapped cleverly with that celebrated left foot to put Adelaide further ahead and take a commanding lead into the first break. Adelaide’s midfield stayed on top in the second stanza, with their bigger bodies proving too much for the Dees. Melbourne defended bravely to repel several Crows raids and keep the margin tight and it frustrated the home side who squandered some easy chances and allowed Daisy Pearce’s soldiers to seize back the momentum. When Demons forward Alyssa Bannan stole a ball from the kick out and raced into an open goal to split the big sticks one minute before the break, it was game on. But Adelaide came back from the long break refreshed and refocused and made a perfect start to the second half when Danielle Ponter marked strongly in the goal-square and converted. With the grand final slipping away, Melbourne had to counter and did, stepping up the pressure and attacking through the corridor. Their reward was a vital major to Melbourne’s Kate Hore after a long ball from Tayla Harris. It narrowed the margin to 10 points and kept the crowd on the edge of their seats. Entering the final quarter, it was the Dees running on top of the ground, launching wave after wave of attack and commanding repeat inside-50s. But buoyed by a boisterous Adelaide Oval crowd of 16,712, the Crows held on grimly. Then came the goal that broke Melbourne and delivered Adelaide their third premiership. With five minutes to go and Melbourne pressing, a quick transition found Danielle Ponter who had been a menacing presence all afternoon. Ponter marked strongly, played on, and threaded a super goal to delirious crowd scenes. In the end history will show Adelaide conquered Melbourne 4.5 (29) to 2.4 (16) to win the fifth AFLW competition and register the club a third flag. Best on-ground was Adelaide’s Anne Hatchard who was relentless all day. It denied Adelaide legend Erin Phillips a third medal after claiming honours in 2017 and 2019, but Phillips forgave it. Adelaide had cemented themselves as the greatest women’s team the AFLW has seen. Tougher, bigger, swifter and better organised down back they held their nerve and now hold the Cup. A roller coaster AFLW season of Covid scares, extreme weather, injuries and challenges, climaxed in a cracking Grand Final, with a worthy Premier.",Sport/Sport,Adelaide Crows claim third premiership defeating Melbourne Demons in grand final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/adelaide-crows-claim-third-premiership-defeating-melbourne-demons-in-grand-final
