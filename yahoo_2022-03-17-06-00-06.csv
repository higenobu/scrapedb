3/17/2022,"A Russian drone breached Nato airspace after flying into Poland before being shot down in Ukrainian territory, Ukraine's airforce have said. The unmanned aircraft is said to have been circling the Ukrainian city of Yavoriv to assess the damage caused by a Russian strike on the Yavoriv military base near Lviv. An attack over the weekend killed at least 35 people and injured at least 134, authorities said. Yavoriv is located just 15 miles from the Polish border, but was targeted with more than 30 cruise missiles on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian forces said: ""As we can see, the occupiers continue to carry out their provocative actions without hesitation, flying into the airspace of Nato member states."" According to The Times, Ukrainian military sources said they thought it was a Russian Forpost drone, which is not flown by any other country. ""There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,"" a NATO official said, when asked if any NATO personnel were at the base.

Speaking on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said bringing in the no-fly zone would cause direct conflict between Russia and Nato - something he was determined to avoid. On Monday, health secretary Sajid Javid warned of a ""severe response"" if Russia encroached on Nato territory.

3/17/2022,"A community is mourning the loss of a beloved teacher killed in a car crash in southeast Georgia this week. Julie Sikes died Monday, March 14, when a Chevy Blazer she was driving sideswiped a tractor trailer before hitting another car head-on along Georgia State Route 23 in Tattnall County, according to Georgia State Patrol. The driver of the other vehicle, Ashley Hartmeyer, was also killed in the wreck. No other injuries were reported. Evans County Charter School System officials confirmed news of Sikes’ death in a statement on March 15. District Superintendent Dr. Martin Waters remembered her as a “beloved” teacher and instructional coach who cared for her students at Claxton High School. “With a heavy heart, the Evans County Charter School System announces the passing of Julie Sikes,” Waters wrote in a statement posted on the school district’s website. “Ms. Sikes had a profound impact on everyone she met and loved her students fiercely.” The crash occurred just before 5:30 p.m. on March 14, troopers said in a news release. Sikes was traveling southbound on GA 23 when, for unknown reasons, she crossed the center line into the northbound lanes, striking both the tractor trailer and a Toyota Highlander driven by Hartmeyer. Hartmeyer, who worked as a counselor at Long State Prison, was “the happiest when she could spend time with her family and friends,” according to an online obituary. She’s survived by her two sons, her parents and other relatives. Family and friends took to Facebook to remember the Savannah native, who they described as a “public servant” and a “stern but caring counselor.” Braving the rain, students and staff also gathered for a vigil Tuesday, March 15, to remember Sikes, WTOC reported. Lena Mincey recalled how Sikes “took me in as one of her own” when she arrived as a new student. “Ms. Sikes will definitely be remembered for how she cared about her students,” Mincey told the news station. “I don’t think any other teacher could come close to the effect she had on us and the love she had for us.” The district announced that Claxton High School would close early Thursday, March 17, to allow students and staff to attend a memorial service for the late teacher. State troopers said the crash remains under investigation.

3/17/2022,"Schumer pledged to haul in oil CEOs to testify before Congress in the near future on price gouging. Manchin said he was in favor of it, but held back his criticism of the oil companies. Democrats are stepping up their attacks on oil companies with high prices squeezing Americans' paychecks. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that oil and gas CEOs would soon be expected to testify before Congress with prices still high at the pump. ""The bewildering incongruity between falling oil prices and rising gas prices smacks of price gouging,"" he said in a floor speech. ""The Senate is going to get answers, and that's why we will be calling on the CEOs of major oil companies to come testify before the Congress."" Some support for the idea came from a senator who's often sided with Republicans to tank elements of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda: Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat with close ties to the fossil fuel industry. Manchin said he had ""no problem bringing them in"" to ""explain basically how the process works."" He's long leaned on the White House to cut red tape and accelerate domestic production of fossil fuels to soften the blow of rising prices. ""We'll all understand a little bit better rather than just beating people up that we're expecting to provide the energy we need,"" he told Insider. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said the hearing would probably take place under the Senate Budget Committee. He chairs the panel and held hearings over the past year on outsized corporate power, huge Wall Street profits, and income inequality. ""The price of oil has gone down recently, the price of gas continues to go up,"" Sanders told Insider. ""They make outrageous profits and the American people want to know why."" Prices for oil and natural gas soared last year as the economy rebounded with demand not keeping up with supply. Climbing prices prompted firms like Exxon Mobil and Chevron to recently report their biggest profits in years, even before Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. It's prompted Democrats to ratchet up their criticism of oil companies with high gas prices squeezing Americans' paychecks ahead of the November midterms. It was not immediately clear which oil executives would be called to testify before Congress. Gas prices stood at $4.31 a gallon on Wednesday, per AAA, a two-cent drop from two days ago. By comparison, the price of crude oil dropped below $100 a barrel after it hit $140 last week in the wake of Russia's invasion, the highest level since summer 2008. President Joe Biden was highly critical on Wednesday, saying in a tweet that ""oil and gas companies shouldn't pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans."" —President Biden (@POTUS) March 16, 2022 ""The oil industry made about $200 billion in profits last year. If it's profitable for them to increase production, they'll do it. If it's not they won't,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Insider. ""Their motivator is profits, profits, profits."" Experts say price fluctuations with crude oil take longer to filter through to gas stations trying to make a profit. They tend to offload gas bought at higher prices first, creating a lag when consumers can expect to see lower crude oil prices reflected when they go refill their tank.

His name appeared on a Treasury Department list of major Russian oligarchs 'close to Putin.'"" In his State of the Union speech March 1, President Joe Biden announced that Russian oligarchs were being targeted for bilking ""billions of dollars off this violent regime."" ""We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets,” Biden said. “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.""
