5/20/2022,"‘She was a stubborn, indomitable, unconquerable creature. Nothing could tame her, nothing could daunt her,” said conductor Thomas Beecham, speaking in 1958 about the composer Ethel Smyth. “She is of the race of pioneers, of path-makers,” agreed her friend Virginia Woolf. “She has gone before and felled trees and blasted rocks and built bridges and thus made a way for those who come after her.” “She’s badass. I’d love to have met her,” says Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts. The tenor sings in a new production of Smyth’s 1906 opera The Wreckers, which makes its debut at Glyndebourne on 21 May, and will be performed at the Proms this summer. Her music is “incredible”, the conductor Robin Ticciati says. “She uses the brass and the timps as weapons, blades!” Smyth wrote six operas, a mass, countless chamber works and even a ballet, but she is best known today for her 1910 song The March of the Women, which became the official anthem of the suffragette movement. She was a passionate activist, throwing bricks through the windows of cabinet ministers – which led to a two-month jail sentence. Beecham recalled visiting her in Holloway prison: “On this particular occasion, the warden said: ‘Come into the quadrangle.’ There were a dozen ladies, marching up and down, singing hard. He pointed up to a window where Ethel was leaning out, conducting with a toothbrush, also with immense vigour and joining in the chorus of her own song The March of the Women.” The Wreckers is set in a remote corner of 18th-century Cornwall where villagers live a precarious existence plundering ships lured on to the rocks, and invoking ancient salvage rights that allow them to murder shipwrecked crew for profit. But when two of the community resist this and the strictures of their own roles, tragedy ensues. Lauren Fagan sings the role of Avis, one of the two central female characters. “She’s a really awesome and exciting person to sing,” Fagan says. “She makes bold decisions. I’m feeling quite empowered and strong, even if at the end Avis too is cast out of the community.” For the director, Melly Still, the work reflects the defiant, unorthodox views of its creator. “Librettist Henry Brewster and Smyth were clear that they weren’t making this a piece about the Cornish people and wrecking specifically,” Still says. “For them it was a symbol of Britain and its insularity.” Little about Smyth was ordinary, from her bisexuality to her determination to compose on her terms, and refusal to accept that her voice was any less important than that of her male counterparts. “I would certainly call The Wreckers a feminist opera,” Still says. “It’s about the women in it finding their voice. Its central character, Thurza, tries to break free from the restricted world she is forced to live in. And Smyth subverts all the operatic tropes. She made the moral heart of the opera a mezzo, a voice type normally consigned to the witches/bitches/breeches roles; and the soprano, Avis, is a really feisty character – not the classic transgressor saved by a prince charming.” As much as it’s about defiance and individual freedoms, Ticciati adds, the opera is about how a community turns into a mob. With its dark narrative of scapegoats and violence and its remote coastal setting, the work has parallels with Benjamin Britten’s opera Peter Grimes, although Britten said he did not know Smyth’s work. It’s hard to imagine he didn’t come across bits of it at the Proms: in the 35 years between 1913 and 1947, 27 separate Prom seasons featured either The Wreckers’ Overture or its Prelude to act 2. Productions and complete recordings, however, were few and far betweeneven during Smyth’s lifetime, and Glyndebourne’s staging is the first professional one done in French, the language in which the opera was originally written. The history of Smyth’s opera is as dramatic as the Cornish coast where it is set. Smyth’s librettist, Brewster (her lover and lifelong friend), was a bilingual French/English speakers. Smyth, who studied in Leipzig, was steeped in European musical traditions and spoke German and French fluently. Their decision to write the libretto in French is likely to have been a pragmatic one. “The conductor at the time at Covent Garden was the French-born André Messager. Perhaps she thought ‘a French conductor is bound to put this on,’” Still says. Smyth also hoped that a French-language opera would find a more receptive audience over the Channel where she felt there wasn’t the same divide between “composers” and “female composers”. She was, however, wrong on both counts, and it was in German, not French or even English, that the Wreckers was premiered, in Leipzig in 1906. The performance was well received, but Smyth was horrified by cuts made to the third act and, when the conductor refused to reinstate the missing passages, she marched into the orchestra pit herself and removed the musicians’ parts and the full score, and took them on a train to Prague. An under-rehearsed performance there was a disaster and although her work had found a fan in Gustav Mahler, his hopes to put her opera on in Vienna in 1907 came to nothing. Back in England the indomitable Smyth persuaded Beecham to listen to her work, as he recollected. “She came to me in a very excited state. She said, ‘You have got to conduct my opera The Wreckers … Will you come and see me, and I will go through it with you?’ She played the whole piece through, mostly the wrong notes, but with a vigour and elan that was really very inspiriting.” And so 1909 saw six performances at Her Majesty’s theatre, and then, the following year, at Covent Garden – the first opera by a woman to be produced there. “Smyth and a poet friend of hers translated the French into a very kind of baroque Edwardian ladies’ poetry, and there were cuts to shorten the work. But as soon as you start cutting, the character and all the complexity vanishes and it all becomes quite two-dimensional,” Still says. Even so, Smyth’s opera was a success – even King Edward VII came to see it – but then her work all but disappeared from opera houses. A semi-staging at the Proms in 1994 brought her back to the Royal Albert Hall, and in 2006 Cornwall’s Duchy Opera staged a reduced and newly translated English version of The Wreckers in its centenary year. The opera has however, never been performed as Smyth originally wrote it. “We wanted to go right back to the source” says Ticciati. “Opera in its original language flows better,” says James Rutherford, singing Laurent. “The minute you change something there’s always a compromise. Going back to the original makes you think: ‘OK, this is obviously what was intended.’” “We’re all still waiting to hear what it sounds like,” l Ticciati. The London Philharmonic Orchestra are yet to join rehearsals at Glyndebourne to bring Smyth’s passionate and rich score to life; up to this point, Ticciati, Still and the cast have had only fragments of recordings; rehearsals have been with a pianist repetiteur rather than the full orchestra. And what will it sound like? “When you don’t know a composer and their language, you start by comparing their music to others,” says tenor Rodrigo Porras Garulo, who sings Marc. “She has such a big vocabulary that sometimes you think you’re singing Cavalleria Rusticana, sometimes you think you’re singing Debussy, sometimes a Schubert song, other times Irish folk songs. It’s very mixed, and that’s the beauty of it.” “My role starts with light French melodies, then there’s a dramatic duet, then I have a crazy full-on aria where I have to murder a rat, and by the final act I’m doing my best Wagnerian dramatic soprano interpretation, high and loud,” Fagan says. Much of Ticciati and the music team’s work these past two years has been detail-focused as they sought to create the Ur-score. “We’re sharpening, chamfering, varnishing everything to make it have the wings so that it can fly,” Ticciati says. Smyth never even got to hear her opera as she had first written it. “At the same time as thinking: ‘What did Ethel want?’, we’ve also been asking ourselves: ‘What can we do to make this piece live at its best?’” For everyone involved, the freedom of not having previous recordings or productions to refer to is exhilarating – and scary. “Actually that’s made me a bit nervy … that every person who comes to see this will never have heard it in this way,” says Lloyd-Roberts. “That gives us a different kind of responsibility and obviously we want this opera to be a huge success.” “I hope it’s a beautiful assault on our senses – and on our expectations,” Still says. Ticciati is confident the drama and power of the music will speak for itself. “I hope that it’s going to be tidal and it’s going to hit audiences in the face – whhhooomph!”  ​​The Wreckers is at Glyndebourne festival from 21 May to 24 June, and at the BBC Proms on 24 July.

5/20/2022,"Seth Meyers celebrated the defeat of Trump loyalist Madison Cawthorn in the North Carolina Republican primaries on Tuesday, which will end the 26-year-old freshman congressman’s scandal-ridden term in office. “Oh Madison, you may be gone but soon you’ll be forgotten,” the Late Night host said. “At least now he’ll have more time for his other jobs – starring as, I don’t know, the bad boy villain in a CW drama?” Cawthorn, once seen as a rising star within the party, faced an aggressive opposition campaign waged by fellow Republicans disgruntled with his antics – calling the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a “thug”, for example, as well as accusations of insider trading. “I will say, it’s a rare treat to watch Republicans tear each other apart, because when Republicans decide to knife each other, they hold nothing back,” Meyers said. “Democrats just snipe at each other on cable news about who’s responsible for their poll numbers.” “They’re like the Wasp-y Connecticut family that just passive aggressively bickers at the dinner table and then goes to bed full of quiet resentment,” he continued. “Going from that to Republican infighting is like when you date someone whose family is Italian and you go over to their house for dinner and they’re just chucking plates of spaghetti across the room.” The last straw for many in the GOP was when, in a podcast interview in March, Cawthorn claimed to have been invited to cocaine-fueled sex parties by fellow Republicans. “Normally I would’ve dismissed that all as ridiculous, except the GOP freaked out,” said Meyers. Nevertheless, Cawthorn still received support from Donald Trump, who posted “let’s give Madison a second chance” on Truth Social before the primary. “‘Let’s give Madison a second chance’ sounds like something you’d hear at a sorority after a pledge barfs all over the rug,” Meyers joked. “Cawthorn’s loss proves that the GOP establishment, if it wanted to, could easily ostracize its most toxic members,” Meyers concluded. “It just chooses not to. It has actively chosen to collude with Trump and his ilk, no matter how dangerous they are to democracy, because they think that’s the path to power.” And on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert recapped the results of Tuesday’s primaries in several important states. “The results are in,” he said, “and America has upheld its proud tradition of not knowing who won,” at least in one of the most closely watched races, the GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania. As of taping, the race was too close to call, with Mehmet Oz at 31.3% of the vote and Dave McCormick at 31.1%. “Wow, that’s a nail biter. That is stressful. And there is no better cure for stress than Dr Oz’s Raspberry Ketone & Green Coffee Bean Protein Pancake Mix,” Colbert joked, referencing the TV doctor’s long history of dubious pseudo-scientific claims. Pennsylvania law requires a recount when the margin is half a percentage point or less, “but one Dr Oz supporter sees a way around that”, Colbert noted. That would be Donald Trump, who posted on Wednesday: “Dr Oz should declare victory. It makes it much harder for them to cheat with the ballots that they ‘just happened to find’.” “Well, I will give him this: he is an authority on cheating. Just ask all of his wives,” Colbert quipped. The host also celebrated the loss of Madison Cawthorn, who ostracized himself from the GOP when he told a podcast that he was frustrated by cocaine use in Washington: “Some of the people that are leading on the movement to try and remove addiction in our country and then you watch them do a key bump of cocaine in front of you,” he said. “OK, that’s an obvious lie,” Colbert said. “If members of Congress were on cocaine, they would get a lot more done.”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on Madison Cawthorn’s loss: ‘A rare treat to watch Republicans tear each other apart’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/19/seth-meyers-madison-cawthorn-dr-oz-republican-primaries
5/20/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, shares her Netflix account with four other households, including her mother’s, she has told MPs, calling the streaming service an “incredibly generous system”. Dorries argued that the recent share price collapse at Netflix, which is now worth less than a third of its market value at the start of the year, was evidence only of its success. “I think that [for] people to even try and paint a picture that Netflix … is struggling is slightly over-egging the pudding. But they are going to have to revise their business model,” she told the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee. “I’ve always thought it’s [an] incredibly generous system that it has, if you have an account, of allowing other people access. I mean, my mum has access to my account, my kids do. I have Netflix, but there are four other people who can use my Netflix account in different parts of the country.” Dorries was then apparently told by Sarah Healey, the department’s permanent secretary, that password sharing was not allowed on the service. Dorries said the broader collapse in tech stocks made the case for privatising Channel 4 stronger, not weaker. The broadcaster needed to accept the sale was inevitable and that the proposed alternatives were not acceptable. “It’s time to wake up and smell the coffee: Channel 4 is being sold, subject to a vote. I did spend my entire Easter recess reassuring myself that we are in a position where this will happen. And it is very much a case that it is being sold. “The arguments for not selling it – the reasons for not selling it – we have been through hoops discussing and analysing those reasons. But the fundamental points don’t change, the arguments don’t change: it is owned by the government, and any borrowings or investment stand against the government’s balance sheet.” She said the government would keep the public service remit for a privatised channel 4 for the next 10 years, but after that it was up to the channel’s new owners to decide what they wanted to do with it – which could include ditching the channel’s news coverage. “I’m not going to justify a news programme whose news anchor went out shouting obscenities about the Conservative party,” she said. “So, you know, they don’t do themselves any favours sometimes, the news programme.” Dorries also accused Channel 4 of hiring paid actors for a TV show, Tower Block of Commons, that she appeared in as a new MP. The show, in which Dorries was sent to live in South Acton estate in west London, sparked a minor scandal when the MP was revealed to have smuggled in a £50 note, which she claimed was intended to buy gifts for the children of her hosts. Now, she said, she believed the hosts were planted by the show’s producers. “I discovered later, they were actually actors,” she told MPs. “The parents of the boys in that programme actually came here to have lunch with me, and contacted me to tell me, actually, they were in acting school, and that they weren’t really living in a flat, and they weren’t real. And even, if you remember, there’s a pharmacist or somebody that I went to see who prepared food – she was also a paid actress as well.” Channel 4 did not reply to a request for comment.",News/Politics,Nadine Dorries admits sharing Netflix account with relatives,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/19/nadine-dorries-admits-sharing-netflix-account-with-relatives
5/20/2022,"Who doesn’t like a bath scrub? Dolphins definitely do: they are known for being clever, playful, tactile animals, and they like to rub against rough surfaces, nap in coral beds and soak on sponges like guests at an underwater spa. However, dolphins may be getting more from their bath scrubs than just relaxation and leisure. A study published today suggests that bottlenose dolphins may be self-medicating their skin ailments with the help of corals, adding to growing research on their previously unexplored medicinal properties. “It’s very intensive,” said Angela Ziltener, one of the study’s lead authors, of the behaviour of the dolphins with particular corals. “They don’t just go through [the coral] – they go up, they come back down again and they rub their belly, their ventral area and the back.” Dolphins have thick, smooth and resilient skin, but can be prone to skin conditions such as yeast and bacterial infections, scars or tattoo-like lesions caused by viral pox infections. These ailments seem to be exacerbated by global heating. Ziltener, a wildlife biologist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and her team have been surveying a community of 360 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in the northern Red Sea since 2009. They observed that the dolphins often queued up nose-to-tail to rub themselves against corals as soon as they woke up and right before they went to sleep, as if they were showering for the day. As well as a mechanical rub, the dolphins also caused the corals to release a polyp mucus. The team also noticed that the dolphins returned to the same coral species, and appeared to be meticulous in choosing which parts of their body to rub. They ran lab tests on 48 samples of corals, sponges and coral mucus “chosen” by the dolphins, including the gorgonian coral Rumphella aggregata, the leather coral Sarcophyton sp. and the sponge Ircinia sp. The results, published in the journal iScience, revealed at least 17 different bioactive metabolites with antibacterial, antioxidative and oestrogen-like hormonal properties, all of which could be useful in skin treatments. The compounds are not commonly used in antibiotics for humans or animals, but an expanding body of research shows that some corals and sponges have medicinal properties, including antimicrobial. “Such metabolites are helpful if you have an infection,” said Gertrud Morlock, an analytical chemist at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany, and a lead author of the study. “If the dolphins have a skin infection, these compounds could have something like a healing property. “If you think about it, they have no other options. If they have a problem with the skin, what can they do?” The authors note that further research is needed to show which coral’s medicinal properties the dolphins need to treat given ailments, and whether these properties have a measurable, positive impact on the cetaceans’ health. Learning more about the dolphin’s social network and demographic could help with this. Tracking individual dolphins that display the behaviour, and seeing if they have fewer skin diseases or decreased mortality compared with the rest of the group, would make this argument stronger, according to Sarah Powell, a former marine biologist who studies how dolphins transmit their skin diseases but was not involved in the study. Past research has shown that dolphins like to use coral sponges as foraging tools. “I do not find it to be such a reach that dolphins would utilise corals and other plants in their environment for other purposes,” said Powell. Stephanie Venn-Watson, a marine biologist who studies health and longevity in dolphins and was also not involved in the research, said: “Since dolphins are inherently playful and tactile animals who love to rub, it is difficult to be sure that the dolphins are using the corals for medicinal purposes.” A next step in proving the link would be to show that corals ignored by dolphins lack the same medicinal properties, she said. “This is a nice science-driven itch to be scratched.”",News/Environment,Pharmacy in the sea: Dolphins ‘use coral as medicine for skin ailments’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/pharmacy-in-the-sea-dolphins-use-coral-as-medicine-for-skin-ailments

The bad news is that, if they don’t, they will have to get something away to Arsenal on the final day to guarantee safety. “Away” is the operative word: Everton have taken only 10 points on the road all season.

5/20/2022,"Starbucks has fired over 20 union leaders around the US over the past several months as union organizing campaigns have spread across the country, the Guardian can reveal. The news comes as Starbucks workers have filed petitions for union elections at more than 250 stores, spanning 35 states in the US. Starbucks’ chief executive, Howard Schultz, has led a campaign against the union movement calling it “some outside force that’s going to dictate or disrupt who we are and what we do”. The US’s top labor regulator, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), has issued complaints against Starbucks over many of the firings, demanding reinstatement and backpay for seven fired workers in Memphis, Tennessee, three fired workers in Overland, Kansas, six fired workers in Buffalo, New York, and three fired workers in Arizona. These cases will go before an administrative law judge unless a settlement is reached before those hearings. The NLRB has accused Starbucks of more than 200 violations of federal labor laws over the course of union organizing campaigns since late 2021. NLRB regional offices have issued complaints in regards to 45 cases against Starbucks, according to the NLRB. Starbucks also incited more legal concerns over recently announcing the rollout of new benefits for all employees, but exempting workers at unionized stores. Workers at several Starbucks stores have held strikes in protest of the company’s behavior toward union organizing. Laila Dalton, a shift supervisor at Starbucks for about three years in Phoenix, Arizona, was fired the day before her store’s union election ballots were being sent out. Dalton said she started getting write-ups for minor infractions and was interrogated and intimidated by management shortly after her store went public with its intent to unionize. Dalton filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB before her firing over harassment from management. “I filed a complaint, an unfair labor practice charge, and that’s when it kind of all started,” said Dalton. She was fired on 4 April and has since been included in the NLRB complaint calling for reinstatement for her and two co-workers. “It was the day before the ballots were sent out. It was in front of people I’ve never met before and it was an hour into Howard Schultz being in office and his town hall speech,” added Dalton. “I still can’t believe they fired me since I already had a complaint against them.” Union organizers at Starbucks have also been fired in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Louisiana and Rochester, New York. Ashlee Feldman, a shift supervisor at a Starbucks store in St Louis, Missouri, for three years, was fired a few days before her store’s union election ballots were to be mailed out. Feldman said she was fired after she closed the dining area of her Starbucks store to drive-thru only temporarily due to short staffing. “I believe I was fired for being a shift supervisor who was pro-union,” said Feldman. “I’ve been with Starbucks almost three years and have never had any issues.” She is in the process of filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board to get reinstated. “I’m shocked at this firing and all I can think about is my eight-year-old autistic son who needs therapy and care that costs money,” added Feldman. “These higher-ups don’t care about us. They aren’t in the stores busting ass like we are. They don’t connect with the customers like we do.” In regard to Feldman’s termination, a Starbucks spokesperson said: “A partner’s interest in a union does not exempt them from the standards we have always held. Any claims of anti-union activity are categorically false.” According to the National Labor Relations Board, as of 13 May, 69 Starbucks stores have voted to form unions, nine stores voted against, and six union elections are still pending an outcome, based on challenged ballots.",News/Business,Revealed: Starbucks fired over 20 US union leaders in recent months,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/starbucks-fired-over-20-us-union-leaders
5/20/2022,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has paused a new government board’s work on disinformation and accepted the resignation of its leader, capping weeks of argument about free speech rights in the US and a frenzy of conspiracy theories. Former disinformation governance board director Nina Jankowicz told the Associated Press hours after resigning on Wednesday that a wave of attacks and violent threats she has fielded since the board’s launch will not stop her from speaking out about disinformation campaigns pulsing through the social media feeds of Americans. “We need to have a grownup conversation about how to deal with threats to our national security and that’s not what happened here,” Jankowicz said. “I’m not going to be silenced.” What remains to be seen is how the board’s disastrous rollout and ensuing criticism around it will damage ongoing US efforts to counter disinformation used as a weapon by Russia and other adversaries. The homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, acknowledged the board’s controversy had become a distraction to the department’s other work, which includes safeguarding US elections, two officials familiar with his decision said. While the board has not formally been closed down, it will be reviewed by members of a DHS advisory council that is expected to make recommendations in 75 days. The Washington Post first reported the board’s pause. Federal and state agencies treat disinformation as a national security threat. In a statement announcing its launch, DHS said the new initiative would coordinate efforts around threats of Russian disinformation campaigns aimed at the US and false claims that encourage migrants to travel to the US-Mexico border. The new board was hampered from the start by questions about its purpose, funding and work that Mayorkas struggled to answer even as he appeared in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill earlier this month. Mayorkas made the decision to pause the board after the negative reaction and growing concerns that it was hindering DHS’s other work on disinformation, according to two department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “The board has been grossly and intentionally mischaracterized: it was never about censorship or policing speech in any manner,” the department said in a statement. “It was designed to ensure we fulfill our mission to protect the homeland, while protecting core constitutional rights.” The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, noted the board had never met and neither the department nor Jankowicz had any power to censor or remove content labeled as disinformation. DHS officials had tried to quell concerns about how the board would affect issues of free speech and online privacy by describing it as an internal working group intended to study definitions of disinformation across the department. But opponents have attacked the board’s work and purpose. The top Republicans on the House intelligence and homeland security committees issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling the board “a political tool to be wielded by the party in control”. “This board was only successful in reinforcing that the Department of Homeland Security’s priorities are severely misplaced,” wrote Representatives Mike Turner of Ohio and John Katko of New York, who previously said DHS had not disclosed information to them about the program. Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, told Mayorkas the board was a “terrible idea” that “communicates to the world that we’re going to be spreading propaganda in our own country”. Twenty Republican attorneys general, led by Jason Miyares of Virginia, threatened Mayorkas with legal action over the board “unless you turn back now and disband this Orwellian Disinformation Governance Board immediately”, Miyares said in a statement. Reception online and across conservative television shows to the board was even worse. The phrase “Ministry of Truth” – a reference to George Orwell’s 1984 – trended on Twitter in discussions about the board. Conservative pundits and social media users pushed conspiracy theories and falsehoods around its purpose, with some falsely claiming the board was quickly developed by DHS in response to billionaire Elon Musk’s quest to buy Twitter. Others put out patently false claims that Jankowicz planned to edit the tweets of everyday Twitter users. “It’s been really mischaracterized from the beginning,” said Cindy Otis, a disinformation researcher and former CIA analyst. Experts on disinformation warned the controversy around the board could hurt existing efforts to identify and stop the spread of false narratives about elections and hot-button issues in American society. Russia has tried to influence the last two presidential elections by boosting false stories and using social media to inflame divisions in American society on issues like race and the coronavirus pandemic. It has continued to spread false and misleading narratives about its invasion of Ukraine. US intelligence officials have also accused China and Iran of peddling disinformation to Americans. DHS has several programs to counter disinformation, including the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s efforts to debunk claims of election fraud. But, Otis warned: “It would be really unfortunate if they just decided that disinformation is too publicly sensitive of an issue.” Jankowicz, too, became the center of sexist and antisemitic attacks, and even death threats online. Jankowicz said on Wednesday that she was reporting violent threats that came in daily through phone calls, emails or Twitter messages. “It was horrible. It was constant,” she said. “That’s obviously really scary and really unpleasant. I was trying to do important work to protect Americans from a real threat.”",News/US news,US homeland security pauses new disinformation board amid criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/homeland-security-disinformation-board-nina-jankowicz-resigns
5/20/2022,"An umbrella created as part of a collaboration between Gucci and Adidas has met with a storm of criticism in China, where social media users have derided its inability to keep its owner dry. Chinese consumers are calling out the fact that the item, priced at 11,000 yuan (£1,311) and not yet available, does not perform the basic function a user might expect. Called a “sun umbrella” on Gucci’s website, the piece from the upcoming Adidas x Gucci collection comes with a warning that it is “not waterproof and is meant for sun protection or decorative use”. The accessory has been mocked on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, with the BBC reporting that one user called it “a very big but useless fashion statement”, while another wrote: “As long as I’m poor, they won’t be able to trick me into paying for this.” Twitter has seen its share of scorn too. “Imagine buying a $1,600 umbrella as a status symbol, discovering it doesn’t stop rain, then finding out it was never intended to work in the first place,” tweeted one user. In comments to Beijing magazine Caijing, Gucci said the item was “not recommended for use as an everyday umbrella” and it has “good collector’s value and is suitable for use as a daily accessory”. There clearly remains a market for an item that is less about practicality and more about making a fashion statement. On Gucci’s UK website, there is a waiting list for the umbrella, where it is priced at a slightly cheaper £870. Gucci continues to be a superstar of the high-end fashion industry. This week, the brand staged a fashion show in a 13th-century castle in Puglia, southern Italy, flying in editors and influencers from all over the world for an event designed to align the showcase of its collection with the lunar eclipse. Until recently, it has been a success in China, which is forecast to be the biggest market for luxury goods by 2025. Analysts Daxue Consulting judge Gucci to be the fourth most popular luxury brand in the country, after Chanel, Dior and Hermès. The Chinese market has been key to Gucci’s exponential growth since Alessandro Michele became the creative director in 2015. Lockdowns in China over the past few months, as part of the country’s stringent anti-Covid measures, have directly affected sales figures during the first quarter of 2022. In April, it revealed its sales had risen by 13% as opposed to the 19% predicted by analysts, and the share price of parent company Kering subsequently fell.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Gucci £1,300 umbrella ridiculed in China for not being waterproof",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/gucci-adidas-umbrella-mocked-in-china-as-not-waterproof
5/20/2022,"Rail passengers and businesses in Scotland are furious after more than 700 train services were axed by the national operator ScotRail in an escalating dispute over pay. Scores of drivers have refused ScotRail requests to work overtime shifts, forcing the newly nationalised company to scrap about 30% of its scheduled weekday rail services. That has left commuters unable to get home or to work early or late in the day. On Twitter, commuters accused the rail operator of presiding over “an absolute joke” and “a complete disaster”. One key worker said it was “scandalous” that late-night services had been removed. Is this some sort of joke?? Last train from Glasgow to glengarnock/Largs now 22:00? What about people who work til 10pm no buses now no trains so we just to be left stranded? Absolute joke I see the new @ScotRail timetable is introducing its own lockdown by ensuring we can’t travel anywhere in the evening. @ScotRail Emergency timetable is complete disaster for anyone commuting between Dunblane or BofA and Glasgow. Only one morning service that will arrive before 9am. Total nightmare Late night key worker throughout the pandemic. Absolutely scandalous that you would remove late night services completely. Disgusted doesn't cover it. The Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs, venues, bars and restaurants, said the cuts were another blow to their viability after two years of Covid restrictions. It said the loss of later trains threatened the safety of customers and staff travelling home. “These devastating cuts to rail services will leave commuters rushing to catch early trains home, and prevent ordinary people across Scotland from travelling in to our towns and cities during the evenings,” the group said. From Monday the last weekday train from Glasgow to Dundee and intermediate stations will leave at 7.10pm instead of 11.10pm; the last service from Edinburgh to Glasgow will leave at 10.15pm instead of 11.45pm; and the last train from Edinburgh to Perth will leave at 8pm rather than 11.13pm. All 10 ScotRail trains to and from Dunbar have been cancelled, leaving passengers reliant on a handful of east coast mainline trains. Similar cuts are expected to Saturday and Sunday rail services, ScotRail has said. ScotRail is reliant on drivers taking on extra shifts but its 2.2% pay offer has been rejected by the drivers’ union Aslef, which is preparing to ballot its members in early June on strike action. In advance of that ballot, drivers are independently refusing to take on extra shifts, union leaders have said. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, was accused by Labour and Conservative leaders during first minister’s questions of failing to apologise to commuters and of presiding over unacceptable and disastrous cuts to services. Sturgeon urged ScotRail and Aslef to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, and insisted the service cuts were temporary. She said it had been made “very, very clear” to ScotRail that it had to solve the crisis. She said ScotRail was training additional drivers to reduce reliance on overtime working, and she said any pay deal had to be fair and affordable. She stopped short of apologising but said the “regrettable” cuts were “disruptive and not acceptable”. David Simpson, ScotRail’s service delivery director, told BBC Scotland that the disruption could last for some months if the company was unable to reach a deal with Aslef. “I hope it’s less than that, I’m always hopeful we’ll make some progress. I think certainly weeks is potentially possible but we’ll do everything in our power to keep the duration of this as short as possible,” he said.",News/UK news,ScotRail axes more than 700 train services amid pay dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/scotrail-axes-more-than-700-train-services-amid-pay-dispute
