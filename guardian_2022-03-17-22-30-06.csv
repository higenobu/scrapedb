3/17/2022,"As highly anticipated debuts go, this one had a long time to build up steam. Francesca Hayward was slated to dance her first Swan Lake back in March 2020, the dual role of white swan Odette and black swan Odile being a ballerina’s ultimate prize. Arguably the best British dancer of her generation, Hayward is golden in almost everything she does, full of spontaneous expression and fine detail, a natural actor who excels in making characters human. But this is a different challenge, as neither of these characters are really human: Odette, the princess trapped in the body of a swan; Odile, an evil sidekick to sorcerer Von Rothbart. As Odette, the main feeling Hayward brings is one of suspension, under a spell and in time – the painfully slow tempo making sense as she falls silently backwards into the arms of Prince Siegfried (William Bracewell). There’s intelligence at work but the result is a certain blankness, although there’s also a hypnotic quality to their pas de deux. Hayward’s Odile, by contrast, arrives in Act III smouldering with self-possessed sensuality. But when she returns after the variety show section of national dances, a little uncertainty seems to have crept in. It’s the run-up to the famously fiendish 32 fouettés, a circus trick maybe, but the focal point of the act, and tonight they fizzle out. Bracewell is another natural actor and while some Siegfrieds can be a bit cardboard cutout, his has fully flawed personhood, a troubled soul rejecting stifling royal expectations with the yearning reach of his arabesque. Yet when he meets Odile the transformation is immediate: his chin lifts, his jumps soar, his eyes pop. “I’ll be a prince for her!” he’s saying. This production, by the late Liam Scarlett, valiantly attempts to bring layers and motivation to the drama (and has a brutal ending), casting Von Rothbart in his own dual role as both sorcerer and conniving courtier – an interesting idea, if not entirely successful. It boasts gorgeous, grand designs by John MacFarlane, well-drilled swans and a hard-working supporting cast – the vivacious Leticia Dias as one of Siegfried’s sisters is one to note.

3/17/2022,"Boris Johnson’s promise to crack down on MPs’ second jobs came at a perilous moment for his premiership last autumn, with backbenchers in open revolt over the botched attempt to save the disgraced MP Owen Paterson. It was a classic Johnson manoeuvre – a bold bid to get ahead of the story, claiming to outflank Labour by promising that MPs would be “appropriately punished” if they put their second employers, not their constituents, first. Yet, like the prime minister’s initial response to the partygate stories that began to emerge in December, also aimed at making hostile headlines go away, it has unravelled completely. In October the fury over MPs’ second jobs had been stoked by Johnson’s own behaviour. After marching Tory MPs through the voting lobbies to protect Paterson, the prime minister U-turned the next day, as opposition parties refused to take part in a cross-party committee to rewrite the parliamentary standards system. As the outrage over the Paterson case grew, the government was rocked by story after story about Tory MPs’ lucrative second jobs – including the former attorney general Geoffrey Cox practising from the British Virgin Islands during the pandemic. So febrile was the mood that when Johnson flew to Glasgow to join the crucial Cop26 climate summit for a day, he found himself challenged about parliamentary sleaze, telling the assembled journalists the UK was “not remotely a corrupt country”. Several days later, with Labour poised to exploit Tory divisions by using an opposition day debate to force a vote on toughening up the rules, Downing Street abruptly announced that it would go further. Cracks appeared almost immediately. Cabinet ministers sent out to explain the move, tabled as an amendment to Labour’s motion, offered few details. Asked how exactly second jobs would be constrained, Dominic Raab said: “You could do it by the amount or you could do it by the number of hours.” When the trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, was asked how many hours might be reasonable, she gave several different answers in a single morning broadcast round. There was always an element of theatre to the plan, too. The long-established standards committee, chaired by Chris Bryant, which had handed down Paterson’s 30-day suspension, was already carrying out a review of MPs’ code of conduct, which was expected to cover issues including second jobs. It is to that review that the government has now made its own submission – flatly contradicting the promises made by ministers back in the autumn. It is unclear whether Johnson and his aides knew at the time they made the proposal that they had no intention of pushing it through to a conclusion, or whether they have caved in in the face of intensive lobbying from backbench MPs keen to hold on to their lucrative side hustles. Certainly, Johnson has never had any principled objection to second jobs, having edited the Spectator while an MP and then been a Telegraph columnist – as well as, for a short while, being both mayor of London and MP for Uxbridge. Having described the £250,000 a year he was paid for his Telegraph outpourings as “chicken feed”, and frequently complained to friends about his money troubles, he may also have had some sympathy for those colleagues complaining that they couldn’t live on their parliamentary salary alone. But like the partygate farrago, the prime minister’s change of heart – if such it is – over MPs’ second jobs appears to fit a longstanding pattern, in which he says whatever it takes to get out of a tight spot, and thinks nothing of reversing course later.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s broken promise on MPs’ second jobs fits a pattern,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/boris-johnsons-broken-promise-on-mps-second-jobs-fits-a-pattern
3/17/2022,"The Bank of England has increased interest rates to 0.75% in an attempt to tackle rising inflation in the UK. That means the base rate is back to its pre-pandemic level. What does it mean for UK savers and borrowers? Only if you have a variable rate mortgage – typically a tracker that follows the base rate, or a loan on a lender’s standard variable rate. A tracker mortgage will directly follow the base rate – the small print of your mortgage will tell you how quickly the rise will be passed on, but next month your payments are likely to go up and the extra cost will fully reflect the base rate rise. On a tracker currently costing 2.25%, the interest rate would rise to 2.5%, adding £18 a month to a £150,000 mortgage arranged over 20 years. Some lenders move borrowers on to rates explicitly linked to the base rate when their fixed-rates come to an end. Santander, for example, has what it calls a follow-on-rate that borrowers who took out deals since 23 January 2018 move to at the end of their special offer. At the start of this month it went from 3.50% to 3.75% following February’s base rate rise, and it is now set to hit 4%. This means since the start of December the monthly repayments on a £150,000 mortgage over 20 years have gone up from £858 to £909. On a standard variable rate things are less straightforward – these can change at the lender’s discretion. Not all lenders passed on December’s increase, although they did move with February’s. Some, such as Nationwide and Halifax, have passed on both previous increases in full. There is no reason for banks and building societies not to pass on the full increase, says David Hollingworth of the broker L&C Mortgages. “It makes sense for borrowers to prepare for an increase in line with base rate,” he says. Most borrowers are, however, on fixed-rate mortgages and their repayments will not change. Interest rates have been so low in recent years that locking in has been attractive, and since 2019, 96% of new mortgages for owner-occupiers have been taken on fixed rates. In total, 74% of outstanding mortgages are fixed. Several million homeowners are now unmortgaged, thanks to years of low rates and enforced saving during lockdowns. The sub-1% mortgage rates that made the headlines last summer are a thing of the past, but new lending is still being done at rates that are historically low. However, some commentators think this will end soon. Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics, says lenders have absorbed the previous base rate rises into their profit margins, but he does not think there is scope for them to do more. “We expect a sharp rise in mortgage rates over the next 12 months,” he says. “Based on our forecast that Bank Rate will rise to 1.25% by year-end and to 2.00% in 2023, the average rate on new mortgages is set to double from a low of 1.5% in November 2021 to almost 3.0% in 2023.” That would cause “demand and house price growth to slow to a crawl”, he says. Currently, though, there is a big gap between the cost of new deals and lenders’ SVRs so anyone who is paying a variable rate should consider moving. “Those borrowers who switch to a competitive fixed rate from a SVR could reduce their mortgage repayments significantly,” says Rachel Springall of the data firm Moneyfacts. She says on a £200,000 mortgage arranged over 25 years, moving from an SVR of 4.61% to the average two-year fixed rate of 2.65% would save a borrower about £5,082 over two years. Most personal loans are taken on fixed rates, as is most car financing, so if you have unsecured borrowing you should continue to repay it as agreed. Credit card rates are variable, but not typically explicitly linked to the base rate, so won’t automatically go up, although they have been increasing in recent months. Savers have been the losers from years of rate cuts, and when the base rate was cut to an all-time low of 0.1% in 2020 banks and building societies embarked on a new round of reductions. By last summer, many accounts were paying just 0.01%. Account providers are at liberty to do what they want with rates, so Thursday’s announcement will not necessarily translate to rises across the board. Springall says not one of the biggest high-street banks has passed on the last two base rate increases to savers with an easy access account. “As we have seen time and time again, there is no guarantee savings providers will boost their rates because of a Bank of England rate rise and even if they do it could take a few months to trickle through to customers,” says Springall. “The top rate tables are experiencing a positive uplift and there is hope that rates will continue to rise, however, we may not see pre-pandemic [savings account] interest rates for some time yet.” Anna Bowes from the website Savings Champion says only 64 of the 158 banks or building societies have announced any changes to some of their savings accounts since the December base rate increase. She says only 33% of all existing variable rate savings accounts have increased by something, but just 2.3% by the full 0.4% increases of December and February. If you have a private pension and want to buy an annuity to provide an income in retirement you could benefit from the increase. Annuity providers invest in government bonds and these are expensive when rates are low as other investors want to hold them. When rates rise those other investors are inclined to sell the bonds, which makes them cheaper. As a result, annuity providers are able to offer better returns. Annuity rates have already been rising and a rate rise could help those who are about to retire.",News/Business,What does UK interest rate rise mean for savers and borrowers?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/what-does-uk-interest-rate-rise-mean-savers-borrowers-mortgages-houses
3/17/2022,"The Philippines is considering a four-day working week to conserve energy, as the cost of fuel continues to rise globally, driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Officials are searching for ways to soften the impact of dramatic price increases, which have prompted calls for a rise in the minimum wage and greater assistance for drivers. The socioeconomic planning secretary, Karl Kendrick Chua, has suggested a compressed working week, with employees working fewer days but for two extra hours each day. He proposed the idea initially for government staff but also encouraged private businesses to adapt their working patterns. “Each Filipino will still work 40 hours per week. But instead of five days, it will be four; instead of eight hours a day, it will be 10 hours a day,” he said, in comments quoted by Philippine Daily Inquirer. The country adopted similar measures during previous sharp increases in the price of oil in 2008 and during the Gulf war. The energy secretary, Alfonso Cusi, backed the idea and called for an extension of work-from-home arrangements to reduce the number of commuters. Workers in the capital region, Metro Manila, were told to return to their offices this month after Covid restrictions were relaxed. President Rodrigo Duterte will make a decision on the proposal on Monday, according to local media. The idea has been adopted by Iloilo City, in the Western Visayas region. The mayor, Jerry Treñas, said the policy would be introduced for government employees from 28 March, to “give [them] time to adjust their schedules”. “We are also going to make use of our modern jeeps to ferry our employees from the district plazas to the city hall and back every day. Other measures recommended for energy conservation will be seriously studied,” he said.

3/17/2022,"The European Commission is preparing to release billions in recovery funds for Poland “within a matter of weeks”, sparking accusations that it is putting EU wartime unity above concerns over the rule of law in the country. The commission has for months refused to unlock €36bn (£30bn) in recovery funds for Poland over concerns about its government’s ability to guarantee the proper spending of EU money, because of its politicised courts. But with a brutal war at the EU’s borders that has sent 3 million refugees fleeing into neighbouring countries, including 1.86 million in Poland, officials are seeking an end to the dispute. According to two sources, the commission is ready to release Poland’s billions if the government moves forward with plans to scrap the disciplinary tribunal of the supreme court, a central aspect of the long-running dispute between Warsaw and Brussels over the rule of law. “There is a strong willingness from the commission to unblock it,” said an official, who added that money could be released within a “matter of weeks”. To release the funds, the commission would not require Poland to reinstate judges ousted from their posts as a result of policies pursued by Warsaw to increase political control over the court system. Nor is the commission expected to move forward any time soon with a sanctions process that could ultimately deprive Poland of billions more in EU funds for violations of the rule of law. A landmark court ruling last month confirmed that countries can be deprived of EU money when they breach democratic standards, piling pressure on Brussels to trigger the “rule of law conditionality mechanism” against Poland and Hungary. The EU executive would also like to release Hungary’s €7.2bn recovery money, but is not taking any decisions before parliamentary elections on 3 April. The incumbent prime minister, Viktor Orbán, is facing his toughest challenge yet against a united opposition candidate, although remains ahead in the polls. Poland has been on a collision course with Brussels since 2015, when the nationalist Law and Justice party came to power and began to take control of the court system, raising fears about the rule of law. Hungary’s funds have been withheld over concerns about the spending of EU money by Orbán’s friends and family, as well as the politicisation of state institutions. Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, which has led to 1.86 million refugees arriving in Poland and 273,000 in Hungary in just three weeks, has strengthened voices in the commission that favour a compromise. “It doesn’t make sense to hold the recovery funds from Poland when we are going to throw money at them,” said the source, referring to the release of funds to help Warsaw manage refugees. Daniel Freund, the German Green MEP who has been a long-term critic of the commission’s handling of the dispute, said the combination of refugees, “the war next door” and the large sense of wanting to create unity meant the commission appeared to be “ignoring the illiberal and autocratic tendencies” inside the EU. “You have people in Ukraine that are basically fighting and dying for the rule of law,” he said. “And at the same time you think it’s a good idea to turn a blind eye rule on those applying the [Vladimir] Putin playbook in Poland and Hungary, dismantling the judiciary, the independent media, taking over and co-opting a large share of the economy.” A spokesperson for the European Commission said it was continuing it assessment of Poland’s recovery plan, which includes “an assessment of whether the measures included in the plan contribute to effectively addressing the country-specific recommendation issued to Poland to safeguard the independence of its judiciary”. A second spokesperson added that the commission was continuing its assessment on the rule of law conditionality mechanism: “What matters here is quality over speed, in particular, since we can reasonably expect any steps we take to be challenged at court.”",News/World news,European Commission ready to release €36bn recovery funds for Poland,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/european-commission-ready-to-release-recovery-funds-poland
3/17/2022,"The Telegraph has apologised and paid £40,000 in damages for falsely describing a former aide to Jeremy Corbyn as an “anti-Jewish racist” and part of the “vile antisemitism of Corbyn’s Labour”. The allegations about Laura Murray, which the Telegraph has accepted were untrue and without basis, were contained in an opinion piece by the former Labour MP and current independent peer Ian Austin, who has also apologised. Austin, who quit Labour over antisemitism within the party and urged voters to back Boris Johnson at the 2019 general election, wrote the comments about Murray in December 2001 after she was successfully sued for libel by the Countdown presenter Rachel Riley. Riley, who is Jewish and was a vocal critic of Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints under Corbyn, was awarded £10,000 after a tweet by Murray was found to have wrongly accused her of suggesting that the then Labour leader “deserved to be violently attacked”. In the Telegraph’s apology, published on Thursday, it said: “We accept that there was and is no basis to suggest that Ms Murray is antisemitic. On the contrary; the court heard in unchallenged evidence [in the Riley case] that Ms Murray devoted significant time and energy to confronting and challenging antisemitism within the Labour party while she was employed there. The Telegraph and Ian Austin apologise to Ms Murray. We have agreed to pay her substantial damages.” After Corbyn was hit by eggs thrown by a Brexit supporter during a visit to Finsbury Park mosque in 2019, Riley tweeted a screenshot of a previous tweet by the Guardian columnist Owen Jones about an attack on the former British National party leader Nick Griffin, in which Jones said: “I think sound life advice is, if you don’t want eggs thrown at you, don’t be a Nazi.” She then added “good advice”, along with an emoji of a red rose and an egg. Later that day, Murray tweeted a response that included the words: “Rachel Riley tweets that Corbyn deserves to be violently attacked because he is a Nazi.” Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that Murray had misrepresented what Riley had tweeted and that the latter was therefore entitled to damages. However, he rejected Riley’s argument that Murray had been “motivated by any improper purpose”. He added that while Riley’s tweet was not “bad conduct”, it could be viewed as “provocative, even mischievous” and said he had considered that context when deciding the appropriate level of damages.",News/Media,Telegraph apologises for claim former Corbyn aide was ‘anti-Jewish racist’,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/telegraph-apologises-laura-murray-corbyn-aide-as-anti-jewish-racist
3/17/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invoked the fall of the Berlin Wall in an attempt to persuade German MPs to do everything possible to halt Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to the German parliament via video, the Ukrainian president upbraided Europe’s largest economy for having persisted in the past in its insistence that the gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 and other business projects with Russia, were “purely economic” and not political. Zelenskiy said attempts to address the issue with Germany over the years had been repeatedly met with the response “economy, economy, economy” and delays in efforts to allow his country to become a member of Nato and the EU, as well as insufficient economic sanctions on Russia before the invasion, had contributed to allowing the attack. He referred to a “new wall” in the middle of Europe, “between freedom and lack of freedom” which he accused Germany of having helped to build by protecting its business interests with Russia at the cost of isolating Ukraine, epitomised by its support of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline via the Baltic Sea, which has now been abandoned. “This wall is only getting bigger with every bomb that lands on Ukraine and with every decision that is not taken,” he said. Zelenskiy quoted the words of Ronald Reagan, like himself, he said, an actor-turned-president, who as US president on a visit to Berlin in 1987, urged the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, to “tear down this wall”, referring to the Berlin Wall which divided Germany between 1961 and 1989. “That’s what I say to you, dear Chancellor Scholz, demolish this wall,” he said. Renewing his calls for a no-fly zone to be established over Ukraine, he referred to the historic 1948-1949 Berlin Airlift, when western allies flew supplies into West Berlin after the Soviet Union blocked all land access to it. “Right now we cannot build an air bridge, because all that is falling from our skies are Russian bombs,” he said. He urged Scholz: “Give Germany the leadership role that it has earned, so that your descendants can be proud of you. Support freedom, support Ukraine, stop this war, help us to stop this war,” he said to rousing applause. Referring to the situation in the surrounded port city of Mariupol in which a theatre sheltering around 1,000 citizens was attacked on on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said: “Russian troops are bombarding our cities and destroying everything that is in the Ukraine. Whether housing, hospitals, schools, churches – everything. With rockets, air bombs, artillery.” Thousands had already died, including 108 children, he said. “And we’re talking about the middle of Europe, in the year 2022. Once again attempts are being made to annihilate an entire people.” Zelenskiy’s 11-minute address to the Bundestag was delayed for several minutes following a military attack that had taken place in Kiev in the vicinity of where he was due to speak, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, the chamber’s deputy president, told MPs. Most MPs in attendance were dressed in black, some wearing blue and yellow scarves, handkerchiefs or face masks, as a sign of their support for Ukraine. Many were visibly moved by Zelenskiy’s appeal. Following the speech complaints were shouted out from some from across the opposition parties in the chamber over the government’s refusal to allow a discussion on the situation in Ukraine and specifically an update on what Germany was currently doing. Instead MPs went on to talk about the plans to introduce a Covid-19 vaccine mandate. Before the session Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had defended the government’s decision not to debate Ukraine immediately following on from Zelenskiy’s address. “I believe in such a moment as this, listening is a real strength.

3/17/2022,"Authorities in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol are clearing the rubble of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike to search for people who had been sheltering in the basement. According to local officials, hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, including children and elderly people, when it was struck on Wednesday. The shelter withstood the strike and some people managed to escape, said the former governor of the Donetsk region, Sergiy Taruta, who did not provide details. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional administration, said on Telegram that the number of casualties was unclear. A satellite photograph from Monday, released on Wednesday by Maxar Technologies, showed the word “children” in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed theatre building. A photo released by Mariupol’s city council showed a section of the three-storey theatre had collapsed, with rubble burying the entrance to the shelter inside. Kyrylenko said Russian airstrikes also hit a municipal swimming pool complex in Mariupol, where civilians had been sheltering. “Now there are pregnant women and women with children under the rubble there,” he wrote. The number of casualties was not immediately known. A witness who posted a video of the aftermath of the attack said the pool had been destroyed and efforts were under way to rescue a pregnant woman trapped in the rubble. Moscow denies targeting civilians, and Russia’s defence ministry denied bombing the theatre or anywhere else in Mariupol on Wednesday. Nowhere has suffered more in the war in Ukraine than the encircled city of Mariupol, where local officials say missile strikes and shelling have killed more than 2,300 people. The southern seaport has been under attack for almost all of the three-week war in a siege that has left people struggling for food, water, heat and medicine. Sergiy Orlov, the deputy mayor of Mariupol, said 80-90% of the city had been destroyed by shelling and that people were “drinking water from puddles”. “For 11 days we’ve been trying to deliver humanitarian aid,” Orlov said. “Our last humanitarian column has been on the road for four days, and Russians don’t let it go into Mariupol. There are buses. We are ready to evacuate 3,000 people a day. They’re not letting us. What’s the solution? Give us a chance to bring humanitarian aid and evacuate everyone who wants to leave. We are ready to do it. They are not ready to give it to us.” In a late-night address on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, compared Russia’s siege of Mariupol to the Nazis siege of Leningrad in the second world war. “Citizens of Russia, how is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during world war two? … We will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers,” he said. Between 1941 and 1944 German forces encircled and starved Leningrad, now called St Petersburg, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. “Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people,” he said. Zelenskiy mentioned the theatre in an address to German politicians on Thursday. “Everything is a target for them,” he said, including “a theatre where hundreds of people found shelter that was flattened yesterday”. Russia carried out further airstrikes on Mariupol early on Thursday morning, Zelenskiy’s office said, without giving a figure for casualties. “People are escaping from Mariupol by themselves using their own transport,” the office said, adding that the “risk of death remains high” because Russian forces had previously fired on civilians.

3/17/2022,"Federal officials have confirmed that the US Department of Justice has reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the families of most of those killed or wounded in the 2018 Florida high school massacre, over the FBI’s failure to stop the gunman even though it had received information he intended to attack. Attorneys for 16 of the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland and some of those wounded previously announced in November that they had reached a monetary settlement with the government over the FBI’s failure to investigate a tip it received about a month before the massacre. The 17th family chose not to sue. The government’s announcement late Wednesday said the settlement resolves 40 cases connected to the shooting for $127.5 million. The settlement does not amount to an admission of fault by the United States, according to a DoJ press statement. About five weeks before the 14 February 2018 shooting, an FBI tip line received a call saying a former Stoneman Douglas student, Nikolas Cruz, had bought guns and planned to “slip into a school and start shooting the place up”.“I know he’s going to explode,” the caller told the FBI. But that information was never forwarded to the FBI’s south Florida office and Cruz was never contacted. He had been expelled from the school a year earlier and had a long history of emotional and behavioral problems. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty last October to 17 counts of first-degree murder. He will receive either a death sentence or life in prison after a penalty trial that is scheduled to start in April. In the aftermath of the shooting, Parkland student activists formed March for Our Lives, a group that rallied hundreds of thousands around the country for tighter gun laws, including a nationally televised march in Washington. Parents also made impassioned pleas for accountability and policies aimed at halting gun violence. A state investigation found numerous security lapses not just at Stoneman Douglas but at schools statewide. The shooting led to a state law that requires all Florida public schools to have an armed guard on campus during class hours. The shooting revived the huge national debate around gun laws, with sharp divisions between those arguing for more lax laws to allow more people to arm themselves and those arguing that laws should be passed to prevent someone like Cruz having access to weapons in the first place. A law was passed in Republican-controlled Florida allowing school teachers to carry guns to work, but many schools rejected this in practice.",News/US news,US justice department reaches $127.5m settlement with Parkland school shooting victims,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/florida-parkland-high-school-shooting-victims-settlement

Wendy thought they were just finding a reason to get rid of a woman. Wendy It’s good to have a woman in these positions. When I got in my cab to go home, the driver said Cressida Dick had just resigned. Robin Boris is an embarrassment, and we both agreed about that – we’re both in despair at the situation. We agreed that the media had far too much influence, and that was a bad thing. Wendy He voted Tory in 2019 – I laughed. He squirmed when I asked if he regretted it. He said Corbyn wasn’t a viable alternative. And I was, like, “Isn’t he like my grandad, a good, old-fashioned Keynesian social democrat?” Robin I blame the unions for the situation we’re in. Had the unions not backed Ed Miliband, David would have been Labour leader, then in 2015 we would have had another coalition, or he would have beaten Cameron. Wendy One of the things he said is: “I’m definitely getting more leftwing as I get older.” And I said, “Yeah, so am I – and I started off in the radical left.” Wendy I can’t emphasise enough how pleasant he was. I come from a big working-class family, and we’re gobby, so everyone tells everyone else what their views are. I get the sense that he’s a bit more middle class than me. Robin She’s fairly reserved and considerate – I think we both were. Additional reporting: Naomi Larsson  Robin and Wendy ate at Mimosa in Colchester Want to meet someone from across the divide?

3/17/2022,"The likelihood that a prisoner held on remand is from a Black or minority ethnic background has increased by 17% over six years, new figures have disclosed. Data from the Ministry of Justice for England and Wales also shows that the proportion of BAME people held on remand has risen since the beginning of the pandemic in late 2019. The figures were provided under the Freedom of Information Act to Liberty Investigates amid concerns that many of those on remand are being held beyond the legal time limit. They show that the proportion of Black and minority ethnic people in the total remand population was 29% at the end of September 2015, rising to 31% at the end of September 2019. This rose to 32% at the end of the September in 2020 and 34% at the end of September 2021, the most recent month included in the figures. It means that the likelihood that a prisoner held on remand is from a Black or minority ethnic background has increased by five percentage points over those six years. Minority ethnic people make up about 13% of the UK’s population, according to census data. At the end of September 2021, 15% of those on remand were Black, the data shows. Black people make up about 3% of the UK population. Adults are held on remand in prisons while awaiting a trial or sentencing hearing. Many are being held after entering a not guilty plea and have not been convicted of a criminal offence. The decision to remand is made by courts according to criteria including the seriousness of the crime and whether it is believed the person will attend future hearings or commit a crime on bail. At the end of September 2019, 9,602 people were in prison on remand, while a year later this had risen to 12,274, and at the end of September 2021 the figure was 12,990. Of these, 2,923 of the September 2019 figure were from ethnic minorities compared with 3,897 in September 2020 and 4,286 at the end of 2021 – an increase of 1,363 people across the three years. The remand population is particularly at risk of self-harm and suicide. From September 2020 to September 2021, 34 out of 81 prisoners (42%) who died by suicide were on remand, despite this group making up only 16% of the overall prison population. The 2017 Lammy review into the treatment of Black and minority ethnic (BAME) people in the criminal justice system found they were more likely to plead not guilty than white defendants. The main reason, according to the report, is a “lack of trust in the [criminal justice system] among BAME communities”. Tyrone Steele, a lawyer at Justice, said that the pressures of Covid backlogs and cuts to legal aid meant therewas less scope to “correct” for biases and thus a higher chance of them operating in remand decisions.” An increase in disproportionate policing could provide another explanation, said Steele. He said: “Policies which have serious racialised impacts, such as the Gangs Violence Matrix (GVM) and expansion of stop and search powers under section 60, were created to ‘crack down’ on serious crime. “Given 88% of the GVM are non-white, and that Black young men in London are 19 times more likely than their white counterparts to be stopped and searched, it is evident that this ‘crackdown’ disproportionately targets racialised communities.” A government spokesperson said: “While decisions to remand individuals in custody are made by independent judges, we are tackling the deep-rooted reasons why people from ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system. “Stop and search helps the police to save lives, with 16,000 weapons taken off the streets last year. Statutory codes of practice and body-worn video ensure nobody is targeted because of their race. “All prisoners receive mental health support and we have trained more than 25,000 staff in suicide and self-harm prevention.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/17/2022,"GlaxoSmithKline has joined other drugmakers in halting new clinical trials in Russia while still providing essential medicines to the country. Like others in the sector, it will push on with existing trials. It said it would not start any new clinical trials and would not enrol new patients into existing trials in Russia, echoing steps taken by its British-Swedish rival AstraZeneca and the US firms Pfizer and Eli Lilly. GSK has already stopped advertising its products in the country and will donate any profits made there to humanitarian relief efforts. GSK is trialling medicines from various therapy areas across its portfolio in Russia, because the country’s regulatory authorities require local clinical data to be included in the submissions of drugs for approval. It employs 1,100 people in Russia and 400 in Ukraine, where it has paused trials and all other operations. Russia and Ukraine together account for 1% of its £34bn annual sales. GSK does not have any manufacturing sites in Russia or Ukraine. AstraZeneca, Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical firm, is still conducting clinical trials of new medicines in Russia and Ukraine, despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago. They include a trial of the combined use of its Covid-19 vaccine with the Russian Sputnik Lite jab, involving 100 volunteers in Russia and 100 volunteers in Azerbaijan. AstraZeneca, in partnership with Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and the Russian pharmaceutical firm R-Pharm, announced interim results of intermediate clinical trials to evaluate the safety of the combination in mid-February. Sir Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca’s executive vice-president of biopharmaceuticals research & development, said that it was important to push ahead with clinical trials. “The most important thing for us is to keep our employees safe and to make the supply of medicines to all these countries remains so people don’t get sick,” he said. “From a practical perspective, we have a lot of trials that are running in both Ukraine and in Russia. It’s trying to keep business continuity for those clinical trials which are important for patients and physicians but ultimately also important … [for] our research and development pipeline.” Pfizer said this week that it would no longer start new clinical trials in Russia, and donate all profits from its subsidiary there to Ukraine relief causes. The US drugmaker will continue to supply life-saving medicines to Russia as “a voluntary pause in the flow of our medicines to Russia would be in direct violation of our foundational principle of putting patients first”. Eli Lilly said: “We also have suspended all investments, promotional activities, and new clinical trials in Russia, as well as the exportation of non-essential medicines to that country. Our Russian operations are now only focused on ensuring people suffering from diseases like cancer and diabetes continue to get the Lilly medicines they need.”",News/Business,GlaxoSmithKline says it will not start any new clinical trials in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/glaxosmithkline-says-it-will-not-start-any-new-clinical-trials-in-russia
