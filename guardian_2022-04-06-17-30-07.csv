4/6/2022,"Hospital trusts in Yorkshire have warned patients they may have to wait for up to 12 hours to be seen at accident and emergency (A&E), after a surge in demand. The West Yorkshire Association of Acute Trusts (WYAAT), which covers six hospitals in West Yorkshire and Harrogate, has issued a plea for patients to attend their local A&E only in “genuine life-threatening situations”. The warning came after the clinical director of a hospital in Lancashire said patients were routinely waiting more than two days for a bed, with staff left “crying with frustration and anger”. “For the past few months we have on a regular basis had more than 50 patients waiting for a bed and that wait being in excess of 60 hours,” Graham Ellis, clinical director of Royal Preston hospital told the hospital trust’s executive team in a letter leaked to the Health Service Journal. He added: “We have witnessed senior experienced staff crying with frustration and anger as they have had to resuscitate patients in the waiting room, examine in the viewing room and CT changing room, seen patients leave the department as they have been pulled out of a cubicle to allow someone more unwell to be treated in their former space and patients die without the dignity of privacy.” Latest A&E attendance figures for the WYAAT hospital trusts showed a 14.2% increase in attendances compared with the same week in 2021. Dr Andrew Lockey, consultant physician in emergency medicine with Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS foundation trust, said: “It’s really important that people only come to an accident and emergency department if they really need to. Our hospitals are extremely busy, and people are having to wait a long time to be seen. “Over the past two weeks we’ve faced huge challenges with the sharp uplift in the number of people attending accident and emergency. This places additional pressure on our teams who are responsible for treating patients with serious and life-threatening conditions. “If you are unwell and are unsure which healthcare service you need, call NHS 111. A highly trained clinical adviser will direct you to the most appropriate service.”",News/Society,Yorkshire A&E patients face 12-hour wait times amid surge in demand,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/06/yorkshire-accident-emergency-patients-wait-times-surge-demand
4/6/2022,"The 1950s have not had a good press. In the US the decade has long been synonymous with a retreat to political and social conservatism following the upheaval of the second world war. Senator McCarthy and his House Committee on Un-American Activities is the obvious example here, but there are many more. Women who had taken men’s jobs during the hostilities reconvened in dormitory suburbs to nest, wear pointy bras and full skirts and raise the next generation of patriotic Americans. Black servicemen who had fought alongside their white compatriots in Europe found themselves returning to a segregated south where they were required to sit at the back of the bus. The 50s, or to be more exact the period from 1946 to 1963, marked what Norman Mailer dubbed at the time the “years of conformity and depression”. Except it didn’t, or at least not for everyone. As James Gaines shows in this revelatory study, beneath the Pleasantville surface of postwar America there churned all manner of resentment and refusal. Everywhere he looks, Gaines finds individuals who insisted on marching to their own drum, even when that brought them into direct and even dangerous conflict with the newly oppressive status quo. In the process, he sheds light on a whole range of underground movements tackling everything from race relations to working-class feminism by way of non-binary sexuality. He starts with Harry Hay, the British-born activist who was gay at a time when neither the political left nor right would have any truck with homosexuals. (Gaines gives a shocking example: when the concentration camps were liberated by the Aallies they did not set free all the prisoners with pink triangles. Those with convictions in the Nazi courts for so much as flirting with another man were required to serve out their sentences, with no credit for time served.) Hay was himself highly conflicted. Early on he had married a “boyish girl” on the advice of a psychiatrist and adopted two daughters in an attempt to “cure” himself. Only later did he start to go against the grain until, at the age of 38 in 1950, he set up the Mattachine Society to advocate for gay rights. The wider point here is that there was nothing simple or obvious about being a progressive in the 1950s. Hay’s campaigning brought him into direct conflict with his former comrades in the Communist party, who declared homosexuality to be not only “deviant” and “perverted” but, worse still, an expression of “bourgeois decadence”. The Mattachine Society itself split between those conservatives who wanted to run it along the lines of AA (at one point it was going to be called Bachelors Anonymous) and those who were increasingly persuaded of the need for direct political action. Gaines sees his job as not to neaten Hay’s story, making it fit one shape or another, but to point up its idiosyncrasies instead. It is, he suggests, in the stumbling quality of Hay’s journey that we see true heroism, a full two decades before the Stonewall riots and Gay Liberation made it simpler, if not exactly easier, to be out and proud. Gaines’s great skill is to use individual life stories, with all their messy contradictions, to dislodge entrenched narratives about life in postwar America. Particularly deft is his pairing of two thinkers who never met but whose writing about the frailty of the natural world echoed one another in uncanny ways. Rachel Carson was the popular science journalist whose lyrical account of America’s coastal wildlife The Sea Around Us (1951) was serialised in the New Yorker and remained in the New York Times bestseller list for 86 weeks. Norbert Wiener, meanwhile, was the MIT mathematical prodigy whose pioneering work in weapons guidance had contributed to the allies’ victory in the second world war. Starting from radically different places, both Carson and Wiener came to the realisation that humankind was dismayingly close to destroying itself. Carson’s final book was the apocalyptic Silent Spring (1962), in which she argued that America’s addiction to chemical pesticides was poisoning the ecosystem on which all life depended. Wiener, meanwhile, published a letter under the title A Scientist Rebels in the Atlantic Monthly in 1947, in which he warned of the government’s militarisation of scientific research and announced his refusal to participate in projects that could lead to nuclear proliferation. Both Carson and Wiener were pilloried for their apparently abrupt shifts in thinking, and both died before they had any inkling that their radical changes of heart would mark the beginning of the modern environmental movement. Gaines is a former editor at three magazines – Time, Life and People – whose titles, taken together, provide the key strands for his braided narrative history. By attending to the experience of historical actors as they move through the world, he builds an account that is full of the complexity of lived experience. The result may not make for a simple read, but it is an infinitely rich one.  The Fifties: An Underground History by James R Gaines is published by Simon & Schuster (£20).

4/6/2022,"There is a lot about emotional tension and teen yearning and the semi-official sexiness of swimming costumes in this confident directorial debut from Croatian film-maker Antoneta Alamat Kusijanovic, though I wondered about some beautifully shot visual cliches. Julija (Gracija Filipovic) is the teenage daughter of Ante (Leon Lucev), an aggressively insecure man whom she has to help, diving underwater with him while he makes a living on the rocky Adriatic coastline spear-fishing moray eels (the “murina” of the title). She is reasonably close to her mum Nela (Danica Curcic) but otherwise unhappily proud and self-contained. Her father is jittery with excitement because his old friend Javi (Cliff Curtis) is coming to visit: a super-rich alpha male who may be interested in buying some of Ante’s land to turn into a holiday resort. It is something of an open secret that Javi was once in love with Nela and may be still, and he is also much taken with Julija’s young beauty. Ante realises at some conscious level that adroitly keeping those feelings alive could help close the deal, but it’s a dangerous game, and his own fragile patriarchal manhood is at stake. As for Javi, does he quite realise that the land Ante is trying to sell him is on the island of Kornat, which locals consider blighted by the real-life tragedy of 2007 when 12 firefighters lost their lives there trying to put out a blaze? All this is acted with smouldering intensity and authenticity, particularly by Filipovic, although it’s possible to wonder if there is anything unexpected to come in the third act, or if we can roughly guess where it’s all heading. And also … dreamy-hallucinatory underwater sequences in the movies are becoming over-familiar. At any rate, there are some very persuasive performances, and lovely cinematography by Hélène Louvart.  Murina is in cinemas from 8 April.",Arts/Film,"Murina review – smouldering intensity, fragile manhood and young beauty",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/06/murina-review-smouldering-intensity-fragile-manhood-and-young-beauty
4/6/2022,"If the Russian troop withdrawal from around Kyiv has signalled a new phase of the war in Ukraine, it appears that evidence of mass killings of civilians in Bucha could herald a hardening of approach from the west. In more evidence of the warped reality surrounding the Kremlin, Russia cynically claimed the bodies found strewn across the streets of Bucha were the result of an inside job, but it sounded increasingly desperate set against an outpouring of international condemnation. Western intelligence agencies last week said they believed Vladimir Putin was being misinformed about the nature of the war by a cadre of yes-men. And, as this week’s cover art by the Guardian Weekly’s art director Andrew Stocks conveys, very few people are thought to have the Russian president’s ear. Who are they, and what is going on inside Putin’s inner circle? Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer try to join the dots. Then, Daniel Boffey reports from Bucha, where shellshocked residents emerged from basements and hiding places to find their unimaginable horror filling their streets. France gears up for a presidential election this month that could have profound shock waves for Europe. As polls showed the race tightening between the centrist president Emmanuel Macron and his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, Kim Willsher meets the young followers of the incumbent who hope to get their man over the line. Then, Angelique Chrisafis profiles Le Pen, with some fearing that the far right’s time in France may be about to come. What would you pack if your life was in danger and you had to run? That’s the question we put to activists, journalists and people at threat from extreme climatic conditions, who reveal the contents of the escape bags they keep by the door.

4/6/2022,"At the beginning of this year my husband and I made the decision to end our 15-year marriage. This was not a spur-of-the-moment thing – we had agonised over it for a long time. With two teenage sons, one of whom is on the autistic spectrum, we were determined to live together as a family and for years we muddled along, functioning almost as a business rather than a marriage. We had both been married before, and part of our determination to persevere was the fear that we’d both be “failing” at marriage for a second time, even as our emotional disconnect became more intolerable and our unhappiness grew. When I divorced my first husband, the father of a baby I had in my early 20s, the law required that we either placed the blame on one party or had been separated for two years. Our relationship met neither of these criteria, but my solicitor advised that we could cite “unreasonable behaviour” if I could list anything I found vaguely irritating about my husband. Among other things, I wrote that “he doesn’t let me watch the television channel I want” and “leaves the toilet seat up”. This felt like a very sad way to end a marriage. It forced blame and responsibility on to someone who I had cared about but had married too young, and for reasons that were not a recipe for success. So when I discussed separation with my current husband, we agreed not to go down the divorce route until we had been separated for two years, as we didn’t want to have to place blame or trivialise what had been a long and initially happy marriage. We both felt that our values and integrity superseded any desire for a quick divorce. We felt we had no choice but to wait, even though it was becoming abundantly clear that the deterioration in the relationship was having a detrimental effect on our family and we both wanted to move on as quickly and painlessly as possible. Then, after a visit to a mediator in February to help us sort out child and financial arrangements, we discovered that something huge was about to happen: the law in England and Wales was changing to allow “no-fault divorce”, removing the requirement to either place blame, or demonstrate a two-year separation. That law change came into effect today, and anecdotal evidence from law firms suggests we’re far from the only couple who will be jumping at the chance to divorce blame-free. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that divorces were down by a quarter over the last three months of 2021, perhaps because couples who were planning to divorce had decided to wait. I can understand why – the sense of relief for both of us that we can proceed with our divorce, knowing in our hearts that we have tried everything over a long period of time to make our marriage work, is indescribable. We can tell our children honestly that our marriage has reached its natural conclusion, without them feeling that one of us is to blame or even (god forbid) that they are to blame. The prospect of this new, kinder form of divorce has made our mediation sessions more relaxed and given us both a sense of control. My husband and I spent a long time ruminating over the decision to end our marriage, largely because we know we are both good people who haven’t had affairs or placed any huge strains on our relationship. The old laws encouraged us to feel that divorce had to be the result of someone doing something terrible, or of a truly disastrous partnership. This was far from the case for us, yet our marriage was becoming increasingly unhappy and was affecting both us and our children. The new legal framework means we can divorce mutually and respectfully with our heads held high and not see our marriage as a disaster – which it most certainly wasn’t. It was an important chapter of our lives. I hope this change reflects a broader recognition that marriages can come to a natural end and still be seen as successful – even if not everlasting.

4/6/2022,"Chronic worker shortages in the food and farming sector as a result of Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic could push food prices even higher and lead to more having to be imported, MPs have warned. Parliamentarians on the environment, food and rural affairs committee reported that the sector had half a million vacancies in August last year, representing an eighth of all roles. The huge labour shortages in the food industry have led to unharvested crops being left to rot in fields, the cull of healthy pigs on farms because of a lack of workers at meat processing plants, and disruption to the food supply chain, as well as threatening the UK’s food security. The committee – which is chaired by the Conservative MP Neil Parish, along with five other Conservatives, four Labour MPs and one Scottish National party colleague – wrote in a report that the workforce shortfall was the “single biggest factor affecting the sector”. The food industry is the UK’s largest manufacturing sector but MPs issued the stark warning that it could shrink permanently if the government does not address the acute labour shortages, which could lead to wage rises, price increases, reduced competitiveness and, ultimately, food production being exported abroad. They found that food and farming businesses have been badly hit by a lack of workers, with the pig sector particularly affected, prompting a crisis in domestic production. Industry associations have previously claimed that as many as 40 independent farms have left the sector as a result. Farmers have been warning for some time about a lack of workers, after many overseas workers went home during the pandemic, and Brexit has limited the number of EU temporary workers who can travel to the UK on the seasonal worker visa scheme. The government has kept the number of seasonal worker permits – for those who come to the UK to pick crops or flowers such as daffodils – at the 30,000 people allowed in 2021, resisting calls from the sector for a significant increase. The MPs wrote they had “no doubt about the seriousness of the issues facing the food and farming sector caused by labour shortages”, and criticised ministers for their approach to post-Brexit visa policies. “The government has not demonstrated a strong understanding of these issues, and even on occasion sought to pass the blame on to the sector on the basis of incorrect information about its own immigration system,” the report said. “The government must radically shift its attitude and work together with the sector to devise solutions that speedily help address the problems it faces, in the short, medium and long term to help the UK’s food industry and enable it to thrive.” The MPs made a series of recommendations to the government in the report, including more timely announcements of temporary visa schemes, the need for a change in how it engages with the industry, and the need for an expansion of the seasonal workers’s visa scheme by 10,000 permits.",News/Business,"Chronic food industry worker shortfall could force prices even higher, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/chronic-food-industry-worker-shortfall-could-force-prices-even-higher-mps-say-covid-19-brexit
4/6/2022,"Offenders who grab and drag their victim in a way that makes them fear they will be sexually assaulted could be jailed for up to 10 years under a proposal outlined by Victoria’s peak law reform body. The Andrews government asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC) to review “grab and drag” offences after a 2018 assault in which Jackson Williams grabbed a 39-year-old woman and dragged her into an alleyway. He pinned her to the ground and laid on top of her before a passerby intervened. The man was convicted of common law assault but found not guilty of intent to commit a sexual offence by the county court of Victoria. The chair of the commission, Anthony North QC, said people harmed by this conduct experience a level of trauma that is not recognised under the current law. “We believe there should be consequences for people who commit an assault that would make the victim fear they are about to be subjected to sexual violence,” he said. “Changing the law would signal to the community the seriousness of this conduct.” In the report by tabled in parliament on Wednesday, the VLRC recommended the Crimes Act be amended to create an “aggravating circumstance” to common law assault, which would cover situations where an assault would raise a fear that a sexual assault would follow. It would introduce a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, compared with the five-year maximum for common assault. The VLRC recommended the new aggravating circumstance include an “objective test”, based on whether a judge or jury believes the offender “should have understood … the effect their actions had on the person harmed.” But the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) argued that changing the law would complicate a trial and could confuse a jury. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Williams was sentenced to a two-and-a-half year community correction order, including 200 hours of unpaid community work. Williams was unable to explain why he carried out the attack and said he could not remember the incident. The judge hearing the case was unable to conclude that Williams intended to commit sexual assault and said it was plausible he had different motives, such as theft. The verdict triggered a public campaign, with more than 110,000 signatures on an online petition calling for legal reform to fill the gap between common assault and sexual assault. The tabling of the report came as the government introduced reform to parliament that would overhaul victims of crime processes and give victims of up-skirting, grooming and image-based abuse access to financial support for the first time to help minimise trauma.
