1/8/2022,"The guttural roar rising from the start-up pits was flag marshal Shane Adderton’s cue. The 34-year-old technician has been involved in the motorbike world since he was a teenager, and volunteering at South Australia’s racing mecca of Mallala Motorsport Park always gave him a special thrill. “When you hear them start up and leave the pits, that sound is something you look forward to,” he says. “That note of the exhaust – the emotion it creates is part of the attractiveness.”  The vrooming from the pits also serves a more practical purpose. As a flag marshal, it was Adderton’s signal to march out and wave bikes into position, highlighting any dangers and hazards on the track. One race day at Mallala, Adderton missed his cue completely. In his first time officiating an electric motorbike race, Adderton learnt a valuable lesson: he could no longer rely on a deafening rumble of forewarning. “I didn’t know the electric bikes were even on the track until they’d gone past me,” he says. Adderton, a technical cadet, loves to tinker around with his four bikes, but the unfamiliarity of the mechanical workings means he isn’t sure if he’ll be adding an electric model to his collection. He’s not alone in his reticence. That guttural roar he loves so much has inspired not only art and culture, but thousands of clubs around the world full of people dedicated to cruising the roads with nothing between their body and an internal combustion engine except a good set of leathers. But those engines will eventually become a thing of the past, and motorbikes have to be part of that. Global Market Insights estimates the international market for electric motorbikes will grow from $42bn in 2020 to $56bn by 2027 – but this analysis assumes increasing government support and stronger emission regulations. For such small vehicles, conventional motorbikes have an outsized environmental impact. Although petrol-fuelled cars emit greater quantities of pollution overall, they are subject to stricter exhaust regulations than their two-wheeled counterparts, which emit higher levels of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. The quest for ever-louder motors contributes to this problem, with the removal of emissions gear a popular modification by bikers to give their exhaust systems extra resonance.  “There’s something guttural and intense about [conventional motorbikes] that reverberates through you,” says Michelle Nazzari. “Obviously there’s the carcinogenics and everything to think about, but there is a beauty to it too.” Nazzari used to be a bit of a petrolhead herself, mucking around on farms with her two-stroke dirt bike, but then she dreamt up a plan to manufacture emissions-free motorcycles while riding through Colombia in 2010. She co-founded the Fonz Moto company and these days gets a different kind of thrill out of her rides. When she gets a moment from her Redfern workshop, Nazzari wheels out one of her electric motorbikes and escapes two hours south of Sydney to Macquarie Pass. “It’s one of the best rides in New South Wales,” Nazzari says of the winding hairpin turns that lead up from the coastline to the spectacular reaches of the Southern Highlands. Without the distraction of engine noise or shuddering, Nazzari says she feels more present in the moment, with the only vibration coming from the texture of the road. “Not having any vibration in the power train, you can really focus on the quality of riding, not mucking around with the clutch,” she says. “When you go into some real winding bits, you can really feel it.” On the safety concerns related to the silence of the bikes, Nazzari counters that the quiet motor means the rider can be more alert to the dangers around them. “You can hear everything going on around you, and are a lot more present for that reason,” she says. The Sydney-based electric motorbike company’s social media feeds are littered with plenty of what Nazzari describes as “emasculating commentary” about the lack of vroom. “One of the most common questions we get from naysayers is: ‘do you make one for men?’,” she laughs. “It’s just trolls I guess, with that masculinity thing around the sound.” The comments veer from sexism and homophobia to a simple rejection of the silence. “Stuff that,” read one person’s take. “I’ll stick with my 2000 R1 that makes me smile when I hear it rev up … can’t call yourself a petrol head if you like electric vehicles.” Boris Mihailovic, one of Australia’s leading writers about motorcycle culture, doesn’t think he’ll ever flick the switch to electric. The burly, tattooed author of At the Altar of the Road Gods has been a vocal critic of electric models, which he says feel more like appliances than true motorbikes. “Motorcycling is a very sensual thing,” he tells Guardian Australia. “I love the noise they make … The first thing many people do when they buy a bike is can the exhaust system and put on a more tuneful exhaust. Ducatis, Harleys – they live on the amazing aural pleasure they give.” Mihailovic, who is advising Australian e-motorbike manufacturer Savic Motorcycles on how to appeal to true petrolheads, says he personally needs “that connection between exploding dinosaurs and the throttle”, and estimates at least half of bikers will be resistant to the new technology. “Motorcyclists are generally an ageing demographic, older guys 50 and over.” So e-motorbike manufacturers, he says, are looking to younger generations. Mihailovic suggests they will be more interested in the emissions side of things, as well as the instant rapid acceleration that electric offers. “Younger people are happy to eschew the whole thunder-and-lighting thing, and just ride on the lighting without the thunder,” he says. But a dealbreaker for many riders is the lack of charging infrastructure to facilitate the long haul road-trips so iconic in biker culture. “Range is a real issue outside cities,” Mihailovic says. Meanwhile, the Australian Electric Vehicle Association’s national secretary, Dr Chris Jones, says federal and state EV policies in general overlook electric motorbikes at best, and in some cases deliberately exclude them. “Governments have spent the last 30 years demonising motorcycles as coffins on wheels,” he says. “The last thing they want to do is promote such small, congestion-busting, efficient ways of getting around after demonising them for so long.” Jones is an electric motorcycle enthusiast himself, and was one of the engineers behind the Voltron-Evo that dominated Australia’s e-racing circuit in the mid-2010s. The ingenuity he saw on display in development of the racers has him convinced that Australia could have a thriving electric motorbike industry if it was supported. Jones wants to see state government subsidies available for electric cars extended to motorbikes, and stronger emissions standards for conventional motorcycles. Others in the industry are lobbying for the removal of stamp duty – a policy already in place in the ACT and New South Wales. Whatever support electric motorbikes get in the end, the open question remains whether bikers will be able to overcome the cultural attachment to the vroom. Back in Adelaide, Adderton hasn’t totally ruled out getting an electric model. He’s heard they accelerate a lot faster these days, and could be good for city commutes. Adderton is also aware not everyone is quite so besotted with the rumble of engines as he is. “I’ve got friends who have bike tracks in the hills and they make a lot of noise,” he says. “So yeah, I could see electric being good there, you know – out of consideration for the neighbours.”",News/Environment,‘Motorcycling is a very sensual thing’: will bikers accept losing their vroom?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/08/motorcycling-is-a-very-sensual-thing-will-bikers-accept-losing-their-vroom
1/8/2022,"About six hours drive from Sydney and seven from Melbourne, on Thaua Country in Yuin nation, are the small towns of Pambula and Merimbula. This is not your stereotypical Australian coast of bold, gold beaches and “aparthotels” with salt-smeared glass balconies. The far south coast of New South Wales has a gentle, hidden gem feel. Ringed by national parks and nature reserves, solitude is easy to find – yet so are some unexpectedly excellent spots to eat, drink and caffeinate.  The region is as leafy as it is sandy; as brackish as it is beachy. Just an hour from the Victorian border, the coastline is flecked by lagoons, lakes, estuaries and river mouths. It has an abundance of crescent-shaped bush beaches, fringed by salt-pruned scrub and rustling tea tree tunnels that, on a big year for cicadas, can thrum with brain-rattling intensity. Fifteen minutes south is windy, whale-y Eden and, a little further, the soon-to-be renamed Ben Boyd national park. The park is known for its Mars-coloured rocks, turquoise-coloured coves and expansive views of an ocean that, from May to September, is often ruptured by the breach of a passing humpback whale. Pulpit Rock at dawn is breathtaking – you can ramble easily around its sloping platform and discover rocky pockets and pools that, in some places, carve out an aperture to the sky similar to a James Turrell skyspace. Inland are the national parks of South East Forests and Mount Imlay, while the coastal national parks of Bournda (20 minutes north) and Mimosa Rocks (40 minutes north) are worth the trip for the spotted gum forests alone. One hour north is Gulaga, a deeply sacred mountain to the Yuin people. If you climb it, you should “ascend respectfully, wearing a red wristband in deference to its sacredness, in bare feet if possible, and preferably in silence,” writes Yuin, Bunurong and Tasmanian man Bruce Pascoe in the guidebook Loving Country. In a roadside paddock on Pambula’s outskirts, the barn-like Longstocking Brewery lures punters that co-owner Peter Caldwell says once spanned “two-months-old and 94-years-old on the same day”. While the weather can get chilly this far south, even in summer, Longstocking’s lush foliage lends it a tropical feel. In addition to craft beer it serves up local bands, local oysters and wood-fired pizza. Opposite the brewery is the 82-hectare Panboola wetlands, once the region’s race track. For 100 years, punters came to this flood-prone zone to bet on horses but now it’s a rewilded sanctuary for swans, swamphen, egrets and cormorants to wade among the mangroves, saltmarsh and billabongs. The Latham’s Snipe migrates here each spring from Japan. With the bird’s status classed as vulnerable in Victoria, but secure in NSW, it shows how impactful a community-run conservation project such as Panboola can be. Many Australian regions sing the superiority of their oysters but the “wilderness oysters” (the Sydney rock oysters grown in the estuaries between Wonboyn Lake and Bermagui) are crazily, creamily good. You can have them shucked and served with sparkling wine at a restaurant such as Wheeler’s or flip-flop down to an outlet such as Broadwater Oysters, Oyster Barn or McKay’s oyster shed to buy them fresh for a picnic. Eat them for breakfast! No one will care. Don’t forget how badly this area was hit by the black summer bushfires. Respect the land, the waters and the reality that healing is continuing. Meanwhile, always check tides, practice safe swimming and wear lifejackets in boats and kayaks. Serious hikers shouldn’t miss the multi-day Light to Light walk in Ben Boyd national park. In town, and more family friendly, is the 3km Merimbula boardwalk, which takes you through mangroves and past oyster farms. The lyrically signposted Whale Dreaming Trail in Eden, meanwhile, is an intriguing fragment of the Bundian Way, of which the Eden Local Aboriginal Land Council says “is an ancient pathway for Aboriginal people from Yuin, Ngarigo, Jaitmathang, Bidawal Country that provided safe passage between the coast and the high country.” There are two Bundian Way walks in Eden – one in town and one from Cocora Beach to Quarantine Bay. Green Cape lightstation Keepers Cottage, or the cheaper Telegraph Station bunkhouse (up the hill), is a rugged and atmospheric national park experience. The newly renovated 1969 ​​Hillcrest Motel in Merimbula throws it back to the 1970s with coastal views to boot. Choice holiday home spots are Long Point (Merimbula) or Pambula Beach. If you camp at Millingandi Station you can kayak to the beach and get oysters delivered to your tent. Valentina does well-executed Oz-Med fusion with stunning lake views while Dulcie’s does good vibes, great burgers and oysters in a weatherboard cottage from 1925. For bread, pies and coffee head to Wild Rye’s bakery; for top-notch coffee and inventive breakfasts, try Toast. Sprout Eden is a cafe and a food co-op (across the road) and a blessing for self-caterers with its environmentally ethical system of using excess produce supplied by local green thumbs. Any month from February onwards is considered “off peak”. Autumn works beautifully for nature adventures with its mild temperatures, bright and crisp days and still-warm water. Giiyong festival (April) celebrates Aboriginal arts, culture and resilience and Narooma Oyster festival (May) is dedicated to the region’s distinct merroir. Meanwhile, music events include Four Winds festival (April), Cobargo Folk festival (May) and Merimbula Jazz festival (June).",Lifestyle/Travel,A gentle hidden gem: a visitor’s guide to the NSW far south coast,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/08/a-gentle-hidden-gem-a-visitors-guide-to-the-nsw-far-south-coast
1/8/2022,"My life is a collection of failed journals. Lockable diaries, page-a-day prompts, sketchbooks from the brief period I thought I would be the kind of person who sits around sketching people on public transport – journal after journal after journal containing three neatly-written entries, followed by something scrawled in six months later and then blank pages until the end. Bullet journalling was the last trend I failed. Seduced by Instagram accounts showing beautiful penmanship and perfectly maintained tracking pages, I believed that this, finally, was the thing that would turn me into a calm and organised person whose anxiety was neatly contained within strips of washi tape.  It broke down about two weeks in. My handwriting is illegible, and after years of court reporting it always reverts to a mix of long and shorthand. I lost the coloured pens. It was a mess. But this time I kept using the journal. Every major work meeting, every significant project, every call to my bank or my lawyer or a real estate agent in the past five years is written down somewhere in this journal or the one that followed. There are budget notes and superannuation calculations and esoteric notes of passwords and account information. If it was important, I’ll find it somewhere in there. Not quickly, mind you, because there’s no system. But it doesn’t get lost. That great idea I had in February? It’s in there, somewhere. It is a common trap, when you set about trying to organise your life, to look to the habits of hyper-organised people and try to emulate them. As if the gap between being the kind of person who writes notes on the back of whatever paper is nearest or says “I’ll just remember it” and someone who sets aside four hours each week to colour-code their feelings can be breached by dropping $55 at Leuchtturm. Start smaller. First, write all your inane notes in the one place. But you don’t need to be hyper-organised. You just need to remember who you called to get quotes to fix the plumbing.

But it will work.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: get low-fi organised by keeping a no-frills notebook,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/08/easy-wins-get-low-fi-organised-by-keeping-a-no-frills-notebook
1/8/2022,"The Australian paleontologist Matthew McCurry was digging for Jurassic fossils when a farmer dropped by with news of something he’d seen in his paddock – a fossilised leaf in a piece of hard brown rock. Fossil leaves are not usually anything to write home about, but the spot was close, so McCurry and his colleague Michael Frese went to take a look.  What they found in that dusty paddock near the New South Wales town of Gulgong five years ago has had paleontologists – at least those few who have known the secret – in awe. Encased in the rocks are the inhabitants of a rainforest that existed in that now dry and arid spot about 15m years ago. “There’s a whole ecosystem preserved,” says McCurry, curator of paleontology at the Australian Museum and a lecturer at the University of New South Wales. As their hammers split the iron-rich rocks, thousands of fossils have been revealed – from flowering plants to fruits and seeds, insects, spiders, pollen and fish. There will be scores of new species. McCurry and his colleagues revealed the site, and their initial findings, in the journal Science Advances on Saturday Australian time. “Paleontologists around the world will drool when they see this paper,” said Prof John Long, a famed fossil hunter from Flinders University who got a sneak peek at some of the fossils a year ago. Such an array of specimens in one spot has allowed the Australian scientists to build an incredibly detailed picture of a little-known ecosystem from a period known as the mid-Miocene – a time just before the continent dried out to be what it is today. As well as the huge number of different specimens at the site – known as McGraths Flat – it is the fossils’ immaculate preservation that is delivering an unprecedented depth of information. Under a microscope, there is detail down to below a micron in width (a spider’s thread is about three microns). The breathing apparatus of spiders and the contents of fish stomachs are visible. The cells that can reveal the original colour of a feather have been preserved. A sawfly was frozen in time with dozens of pollen grains attached to its head. Since that first visit, McCurry and his colleagues have unearthed a treasure trove of fossils. When the rocks are broken apart, they tend to split the fossilised remains in half like an instant autopsy, revealing internal organs and tissues. Fish stomachs are so well preserved McCurry says they can see what that fish ate – about 15m years ago – in the moments before its demise. “We can see the food in the stomach, like a dragonfly wing. But commonly, it’s insect larvae,” he says. Long saw some of the fossils last year when he visited McCurry at the Australian Museum. “Fossils are often preserved as bits and pieces or fragments. Occasionally you might get a whole organism. But this is truly exceptional preservation,” he says. “You have complete organisms ... soft tissue ... cellular preservation. There’s a spider with its breathing system beautifully preserved. It’s a Xanadu. “There’s all the diversity with a great range of organisms from fungi to plants and fish, and also you have their interaction. There’s evidence of behaviour. It has all the attributes of a world-class fossil deposit, of which we have very, very few in Australia.” “It’s a bit of a Rosetta Stone of the full ecology of this middle Miocene environment. We have no other window into that period that tells us what that part of Australia was like.” New fossil sites are rare finds, and this one was almost missed. McCurry admits he drove past it at least once, oblivious to what was there. On his first visit with Frese they found rocks rich in iron, unusually hard to split, and of a type not known for preserving fossils. But immediately, the pair found what they thought were aquatic insects. Using a microscope Frese had in his car, they could see tiny midges preserved. “That’s when we realised how special the fossils were,” McCurry says. Finding fossilised pollen allowed the scientists to accurately date the site. Little is known about the ecosystems of the mid-Miocene period. McCurry says there are likely to be “dozens, if not hundreds” of species new to science that have already been collected. The researchers have found probable new species preserved in the rock deposit between 50cm and 80cm thick at a rate of more than one a day. There have been eight field excavations so far. Even though only two square metres are excavated each time, about 2,000 specimens have been collected. Now follows the painstaking process of checking each one against known records of flora and fauna. Using analysis of the huge array of plant leaves at the site, the team have even been able to estimate the climate of the area. Warm months were about 26C and cool months as low as 7C. Almost a metre of rain would have fallen in a month in the wet season – the region’s modern climate is hotter but much drier, with the wettest month averaging just 70mm. While much of the team go through the vast array of flora and fauna, Dr Jacqueline Nguyen, an expert in the evolution of birds at the Australian Museum, has been mostly fixated on the only evidence found so far of the birds that were in the rainforest. That is, one single fossilised feather about the size of a fingerprint. “Fossilised feathers are incredibly rare,” she says. “Most are from the Cretaceous, but from the Miocene we only have this one. I’m super excited.” The fossil feather is so detailed that Nguyen and her colleagues have been able to see the parts of the cells that give the feather its colour. This feather – probably from the bird’s body rather than wing – was likely dark or iridescent. “Even though it’s just one feather, it’s a tantalising hint at what’s to come. Maybe we’ll find a bird skeleton.” Frese, who is a virologist by training, has been examining the fossils under microscopes for several years. “I was blown away by the detail,” he says. “I love the way the fossils present themselves. Usually you just see the surface, but here it always splits in half and you see the inside of a spider leg or the inside of pollen.” The secret to the fossils’ preservation is up for debate, but McCurry thinks it would have happened over hundreds of years rather than in a sudden event. Iron-rich water, maybe from nearby outcrops, could have flowed into a shallow billabong, periodically deoxygenating the water, killing the organisms or encasing flora and fauna in sediment that turns into the rocks found in the field. McCurry admits he’s relieved to be able to tell the world about the discovery. “This has been a marathon,” he says. “It’s a really important find and it’s going to keep us going for a long time.”",News/Science,‘A Rosetta Stone’: Australian fossil site is a vivid window into 15m-year-old rainforest,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/08/a-rosetta-stone-australian-fossil-site-is-a-vivid-window-into-15m-year-old-rainforest
1/8/2022,"The line between novel and novelty could have been easily crossed last night at Andrew (Boy) Charlton Pool at Woolloomooloo Bay. Floors Of Heaven: Submersive Study is a 45 minute dip in a 50m outdoor saltwater pool as an ambient composition by British electronic producer Leon Vynehall is broadcast on a “specialised underwater sound system”. The ambient part is a relief: an excitable early report had described Floors of Heaven as “a rave in one of the city’s most iconic pools”, while Sydney festival described Vynehall as a “certified master of the dance floor”. Listening to his club-inflected back catalogue, I did wonder if my fellow mellow night-swimmers might end up being party-starved groups of 10, standing around the shallow end with their hands in the air. And how do you rave in a pool anyway? Sounds like a lot of splashing. Should I Google goggles?  These fears are allayed at the door where the absent DJ is quoted on a placard: “I hope to construct something close to a meditative state for the audience.” Woolloomooloo Bay has given him a good headstart. How have I not been to this pool before, I marvel? Sydney festival is already ticking a box by introducing its residents to spots they can come to any old day. About 100 people drift in to sit on the bleachers in their swimsuits and take in the view on this cool, yet humid night. A grey navy ship hulks a stone’s throw away and the lights of Woolloomooloo’s jungle of enviable apartments begin to flicker on. Even the loud people’s voices modulate down to a murmur, probably because the festival isn’t bringing the buzz. There is no pre-show DJ playing some “beats” – more relief. It’s like going to a restaurant worried the food will have too much sauce, only to discover the chef has let the quality of the ingredients carry the dish. No one needs a themed cocktail in a glass they have to remember to return to get their deposit back, not when they’ve got all this. I peel a sticky mangrove fig leaf off my thong as a bat flaps across the bay. A fingernail moon peeps out from a shroud of clouds. And, ah, those clouds. In the water on our backs, the sky is mottled peach and navy blue. The sole festival flourish are purple and pink lights that do magical shimmery things to air, sky and water. There is enough elemental eye candy to ingest that you barely need Vynehall’s submarine sounds. Then there are the pool noodles, which are allocated on entry. Some swimmers clearly grew up wrangling these goofy-ass things and array them elegantly and with ease. One couple swiftly erects a kind of romantic crisscrossed platform. Others make an easy job hard – though, in my defence, the task is complicated because one’s ears must be beneath the water to hear Vynehall’s tunes. Luckily, an old friend instructs me to put one beneath my neck and one beneath my knees. Perfect! I locomote as such for most of the gig. The music is, well, ambient. Nice. Calming. It swells and retreats; it rustles and crackles. It ends in voices which bring to mind the last line of TS Eliot’s The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock: “Till human voices wake us, and we drown.” Only no one drowns. There are too many life-savers prowling the pool for that.Eliot also wrote in Prufrock: “When the wind blows the water white and black” – also relevant. The thing is: it’s cold. And the body talks. Some are taken early, a trickle exiting the pool for a warm shower. One woman powers through a lap regime in a cap and goggles; her industry irritates me out of my trance until I realise she is probably just trying to stay warm. Eventually I ditch the noodles for a full immersion because the water is warmer than wind on flesh. Unanimously, those I speak to afterwards say the same two things. First, they got a bit cold. Second, they could imagine the experience being more blissful on a balmier night. No one seems bummed. In the aftermath, weighing-up whether we are content or left wanting as we drip and shiver, it isn’t reality and all of its eternal shortcomings that wins. It is the hopeful little hop into imagining how this experience could have been better and choosing to be there instead. I won’t remember Vynehall’s soundscape; in fact, it’s already gone. But I will remember his gentle Trojan horse that smuggled back to us our appreciation of these simple, sensory and so-very Sydney things in the frangipani-scented air.

1/8/2022,"The bank building has been standing squarely on the corner of the main street for 133 years. Quietly doing its business as the generations strolled past. Unassuming and solid with its thick brick walls and flat roof. Its unassailable strongroom was once considered the most secure place to stash the cash of the region. But it was not, as it famously turned out, impregnable. In the sweltering summer of 1978 hippies still roamed the hills around the Tweed valley. What is now suburban sprawl around the New South Wales northern rivers town of Murwillumbah was dairy farms and wooden farm houses. There were large agricultural and farm supplies stores; it was a subtropical, rural place of cows, cane and banana plantations. No one locked their doors. Across town the plume of white steam rose from the sugar mill. In the shadow of the great mass of the extinct volcano that is Wollumbin Mount Warning, it was, says former mayor Max Boyd, “a quiet little country town”.  A place of not much note except to those who lived there – until the night of 23 November 1978 when a major crime was committed and Murwillumbah became the surprised scene of the biggest bank heist in Australia’s history. It was audacious, meticulous, consummately professional, old school. It has gone down in history as the perfect crime in which no one was physically hurt. In 43 years it has never been solved; an enduring mystery that has achieved folklore status in the small northern rivers town. The Transecurity armoured truck which did a run of the banks between the Queensland border and Sydney was a familiar sight in Murwillumbah, sometimes stopping the traffic as armed guards unloaded it into the overnight holding bank. Every second Wednesday there would be a big payroll from the federal government on board to meet pension cheques and wages. Sometime on the Wednesday night of the 23 November the locks at the back door of the bank were picked; there was no alarm. Using an electro-magnetic diamond-tipped drill which clamped on to the safe and allowed them to drill 18cm holes within 5mm of the crucial point in the locking mechanism they then fed through a medical cystoscope with wires to manipulate the tumblers in the safe’s locking mechanism. A fraction of a millimetre either way and they couldn’t have pulled it off. They left no clues, no mess, no trace. But it was a while before anyone knew this. Because, ingeniously, they jammed the safe, removing the two combination lock dials and the safe handles before slamming the door shut. Ample time for a clean getaway. Even these days the main street of Murwillumbah is almost deserted by 10pm on a weeknight, but Allan Mitchell was in the Imperial hotel on that night in 1978. “We were literally looking straight at the bank from the Imperial front bar and I walked across to my car which was parked right in front of the bank and didn’t see or hear anything at all. I’m a boilermaker by trade so I know what was required to do what they did and to do it so stealthily was incredible.” The police station 100 metres away, within sight of the bank, was staffed all night. The late Mervyn Gordon was working on the telecommunication system in the post office on the other corner that night. Says his widow Edna, “he didn’t hear or see a thing. No one heard or saw anything.” At 7.30 the next morning an MSS security guard noticed the back door of the bank was open. Local locksmiths and four Chubb safe experts flown by charter from Brisbane worked on the safe door for more than five hours before admitting defeat. Finally, Tweed Shire council workmen blasted their way in via the external wall of the bank and the thick reinforced concrete wall of the strongroom, using jackhammers, chisels, oxyacetylene cutting equipment and sledgehammers. Outside, waiting in the heat, a journalist described the suspense as “electrifying”. It was 4.30pm before the hole was big enough for NSW police Ch Insp Frank Charleton to put his head in, look around and utter the immortal words, “they got the lot”. The haul was $1.7m, which today would be about $10m. The money was untraceable. And by then, according to a career criminal now taking credit for the heist, the robbers and the money were already back in Sydney and having a nap. Suddenly the amazed town of Murwillumbah was overrun with police. “I never saw so many police in my life,” said local shop owner Peter Moore, “they were crawling over the rooftop of the bank and the street. We did not know there was that much money in the bank in such a little town. It’s the biggest thing to happen in the town since the flood of 1954.” The news was flashed around the world. Peter and his father, Herb, were not slow to capitalise on the town’s sudden infamy. They soon had a lucrative side hustle selling “Got the Lot” T-shirts, tea towels, caps and beer glasses from their menswear store in the main street. Gordon Smith, a contract cleaner, came in at midnight to clean up the mess made by the council workmen. “It was a hot, hot night. There was just a complete mess in the bank. We removed a lot of rubble and bricks. And they made the mistake of turning the fans on and there’s just all the dust everywhere, it was hazy. We were there for seven hours.” While the police turned the nearby Gold Coast “upside down” looking for clues, checking hotels and motels for suspicious guests, in Murwillumbah there was wild speculation. Had the criminals been among them casing the joint? Could they have been sitting on a bar stool beside them in the Imperial hotel? There had to have been an insider who knew that amount of Reserve Bank money was coming in to be held overnight on that particular night. The robbers had known the layout of the bank. Who told them? Twenty-five detectives from three states were brought in to fail to catch the criminals. All leads ran dry. No one claimed the $250,000 reward. The money and the robbers vanished. But, according to reports at the time, it had the Magnetic Drill Gang written all over it: they had used the same method 14 times in the previous 19 months. For decades the finger has been firmly pointed at Graham “The Munster” Kinniburgh, a one-time master safe-cracker and the brains behind the gang. The Munster was shot dead in his driveway in December 2003, a victim of the Melbourne gangland killings. But now a notorious career criminal has come forward to say The Munster had nothing to do with it. Bertie Kidd is taking the credit. Robert Bertram “Bertie” Kidd is 88 and has Parkinson’s disease. He has spent 27 years in prison and has been described by police as a “nasty, vicious, and violent criminal”. Last year he released two volumes of his memoirs with the author Simon Griffin, and he has made plans for a third to be released after his death. “I have read misleading accounts of my career for decades,” he writes. In his memoirs he takes credit for the infamous Fine Cotton horse racing scandal, and claims to have smuggled himself inside the luggage hold of a Sydney-Melbourne flight to steal $2m from a drug cartel mid-flight. He also claims he masterminded the Murwillumbah bank robbery. It was never about Murwillumbah or the bank, Kidd says, it was about the armoured truck and the money in it. Kidd and his cohorts had been following it up and down the coast for months working out “where to hit it along the route”. The reason Murwillumbah came into the frame was pragmatic. After all the “detailed” reconnaissance he decided the best option was to rob the bank instead of the armoured van. “My rationale was that hitting the van could be messy and replied with guns. Someone could end up getting killed and we could get charged with armed robbery or murder. If we hit the bank there would be less risk of anyone getting hurt and at worse [sic] we would face break and enter.” Kidd is adamant that his “exceptionally reliable” informant about the lucrative job on the night of the 23 November was not a Murwillumbah cop, security guard or bank employee. “I feel sorry for those who were accused, in a small town the suspicion would have been difficult to endure.” Kidd was going to do the job himself – “a number of people were involved and a lot of work had been done to set it up” – but he had been unexpectedly detained in prison after a botched job on the Maroubra Bay hotel. But he already had a team set up. They planned it with precision for three months before the heist went down, he says. In prison on the night of the robbery Kidd went over and over it in his head. They followed the armoured truck on the last leg of its journey to be sure they wouldn’t be opening an empty vault. After the job was done, the team went for a “light dinner in beautiful Byron Bay”. The reason no one saw or heard anything in Murwillumbah was because they arrived close to the early hours. It was a pitch black night. A lookout stood outside; there was no one around. Kidd had insisted they had to jam the vault door before they left. But if they couldn’t do that they were to lie low for three or four days at a shack he had on the Gold Coast. There is nothing from Kidd’s account of the robbery and its aftermath that was not in the public domain at the time. “The whole thing,” he writes, was broadcast live on all channels. “We watched in the prison common room with delight. It was a fantastic result.” He claims the haul was a lot more than the $1.7m that was reported. It was well over $2m. And the robbers, he says, will never be caught. “That is because they are almost all now dead after living rich lives on the proceeds of this job.” He says he is the only one left standing and that the money was distributed to families who had someone in prison. The police are officially still investigating this crime; the file is still open. Detective chief inspector Brendon Cullen says he is is dubious about Kidd’s claims “but having said that, if he has got information relevant to that inquiry I would be happy to talk to him”. If Bertie Kidd – infamous gangster and standover man – is to be believed, the great mystery of Australia’s biggest bank heist has been confessed and solved. The mythology is no more. According to Bertie, they got the lot, and they got away with it. Still the perfect crime.",News/Australia news,‘They got the lot’: the mystery of the biggest bank heist in Australia’s history,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/08/they-got-the-lot-the-mystery-of-the-biggest-bank-heist-in-australias-history
1/8/2022,"It’s a regular, hot Tuesday morning in the Kimberley and the dusty, pindan-red streets of Derby are deserted. Except, that is, for workers from the Derby Aboriginal Health Service, who are taking Covid vaccines house-to-house in a bid to protect the community. “We have been struggling to achieve the high double-dose vaccination rates of the metropolitan areas, so that’s been the priority for the Kimberley,” says David Menzel, chair of the Kimberley regional group, which represents the district’s four shire councils.  “We’re trying to get those second vaxes done as quickly as possible, but the reopening is sneaking up really quickly. We’re only four weeks away now and our remoteness and diverse community are huge obstacles.” The Kimberley remains one of the least vaccinated regions of Australia, with just 67% of the population double-dosed, and about 60% of the Indigenous population. It’s a huge area – nearly half a million square kilometres – but home to just 36,000 people, most of whom are Indigenous. The reasons for hesitancy are manifold. Online misinformation and propaganda (much of it linked to evangelical churches in the US) has been virulent, especially on youth-oriented social media platforms such as TikTok, and in church groups. Health services say the proliferation of “fake news” has been the biggest obstacle this year, including rumours that having the vaccine will usher in doomsday, cause infertility or wipe out Indigenous Australians. For the older generation who grew up under the white Australia policy, mistrust in the government is strong, and many families remain semi-nomadic, moving frequently around the region. Many have also struggled to take the virus seriously, with no major outbreaks in the region since the beginning of the pandemic. Malcolm, 54, is a former stockman and homeless. Like many Indigenous Australians he is immunocompromised. Yet he has no intention of getting vaccinated. “I don’t want it, if I get sick, I will use bush medicine,” he says. “I don’t want to use white man’s medicine, the bush will look after me. I will go to the bush if Covid comes to Derby.” Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the bush has indeed protected many locals. When the first cases emerged in Halls Creek, on the edge of the Great Sandy Desert, families headed bush en masse, living off the land, fishing, hunting and waiting out the worst of the localised outbreak, which was spread by medical staff visiting the local hospital.With Western Australia’s reopening date slated for 5 February, plans to manage an outbreak are building on the successes of early 2020. In Balgo, the locals are planning to bus elderly and immunocompromised people to outstations in the bush when Covid hits. Regular food and medicine drops will be supplied by road, and by air if the roads are cut by flood waters. In the west Kimberley, once abandoned outstations and remote communities are being repopulated by families who have left Broome, Perth and the larger Kimberley towns to wait out the pandemic and reconnect with family and country. “I think it is a natural response in the Kimberley to go bush,” says Lorraine Anderson, the medical director of the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service (Kams). “Providing the people who go bush don’t have Covid, then it is not a bad thing. What is difficult is if people go bush and they are sick – it is very difficult for us to look after them. But in general when people head on country they look after themselves very well.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the coastal communities of Derby and Kalumburu, hand reels, sinkers and hooks are being offered as an incentive to get vaccinated, while in the desert communities grocery vouchers and meat packs are on offer, as well as T-shirts, mini-coolers, hats and regular community barbecues. When vials of Pfizer have been opened and not enough people have turned up, doctors walk the dusty streets of small towns shouting: “We have Pfizer, we have Pfizer! Please come and get your jab!” When the internet and phone lines went down in Halls Creek recently, the local health service used the time to corral locals for their jabs, doing laps around the footy oval, supermarket and petrol station offering lifts to the clinic.

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. A number of remote Kimberley communities have reached 100% vaccination rates. Anderson says their success hinged on local doctors, nurses and health workers being drawn from the community itself and “yarning” to their countrymen and women – often in local language or Aboriginal English, and on their own ground. “What worked in the 100% communities is they had really good leadership from their elders,” Anderson says. “If we have people from these communities in leadership roles spreading these health messages it makes a huge difference in terms of trust and how people receive and believe that information.” Vaccination is now a matter of life and death. Anyone who gets Covid in the Kimberley and needs hospital treatment will have to be medically evacuated to Perth – about 2,800km away – as there aren’t enough respirators in the region to cope with an outbreak. And in the wet season, which runs from December to March, smaller airstrips are often flooded and unusable. ‘Tough and resilient’ For Menzel, preparing for Covid has highlighted the fragile and insecure health infrastructure of the region. Wyndham hospital, in the east Kimberley, is operating on reduced hours as it cannot get enough staff. The region relies heavily on locums, as it routinely fails to attract long-term, permanent health staff. “We have seen our health system has been stretched without Covid being in WA, so we are quite concerned about the capabilities of our system when it hits,” says Menzel. “If there are significant outbreaks, we’re quite scared about that for sure.” Some unvaccinated remote communities will probably remain partially locked-down throughout 2022, though this is nothing new, as many have been living that way – with tourists and outside contractors banned – since early last year. Though the region is looking at a trying few months ahead, Menzel sees some cause for optimism. “There is a slight hope that we have a very tough and resilient population here,” he says. “So it may surprise us how resilient they are, given it’s not the easiest place to survive at the best of times.” For Malcolm, the pandemic has been defined by more family coming home to the Kimberley, which means more fishing trips and time on country. There is an air of resignation in his views on Covid – another “white man’s sick” heading his way. “I’ll be OK,” he says resolutely, his dark eyes steady under a black Akubra. “Just go bush, stay bush. No worries then.”",News/Australia news,"As the Covid wave approaches remote WA, a population heads to the bush for protection",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/08/as-the-covid-wave-approaches-remote-wa-a-population-heads-to-the-bush-for-protection
1/8/2022,"Supermarket shelves stripped bare, hospitals straining under pressure and worried Australians unable to access tests – welcome to the reality of living with Covid. Far from the hot vaxxed summer Australians were looking forward to, the Omicron wave has thrust the country into yet another season of uncertainty, panic and fear.  Confused and seeking assurance, the public has turned to the government for help – but lo and behold, the government was busy pursuing its strategy of getting out of everyone’s lives. Driven by a laissez-faire zeal, Scott Morrison has stressed for months that governments of all persuasions needed to extricate themselves from the lives of Australians as we all learnt to live with Covid. The idea was simple. Once most of the population was vaccinated, let the virus run freely in the community with limited restrictions on people’s movements. It was all of Craig Kelly’s Christmases come at once. “Of course we take Omicron and Covid seriously, but we also value the lifestyle and the way of life we have in Australia, and I want Australians to be able to enjoy that as much as is safely possible,” Morrison said in December. Switching the mantle of responsibility from government to individuals and the free market, Morrison stressed that Australians now needed to “make their own choices about their own health and their own lives”. The economy was going to “power through” to next year, and individual responsibility and “commonsense” would become the new guiding principles for managing the pandemic. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said he did not believe the Omicron variant would dent Australia’s recovery, urging the population to “keep calm and carry on” (by which he meant “spend”). At every turn of the Covid pandemic over the past two years, Australians have done the right thing. Vaccination, lockdowns, mask wearing – you name it, Australians have got on and done what they have known to be necessary for their own health and for the health of the community. As the Omicron wave hit at the same time as state borders opened, Australians again sought to do the right thing by getting tested. But within days the system had collapsed. People were waiting hours to get to the front of testing queues, test results were held up, and people understandably stayed away – no doubt contributing to the surge in infections that is now sweeping all states (except Western Australia, which is discovering what 2021 felt like for the rest of the country). Which brings us to the entirely predictable and preventable testing crisis the prime minister found himself in this week as angry Australians turned to the federal government for answers. The key demand put to the government was this: let us take responsibility. As far as I am aware, no one wants to stick a swab up their nose for selfish reasons – it’s not a beer run on a Dan Murphy’s special; they want tests to protect vulnerable relatives, to ensure their children are safe and to keep transmission as low as possible. It’s precisely in line with what the community has been asked to do for the past two years: get tested, stop the spread, save lives. It is galling to be told to step up and take responsibility, only to then discover that the government has let down its side of the bargain. Health experts and economists say rapid antigen tests should be made free, and after several days of contortions, Labor leader Anthony Albanese also landed on this as a policy. But the Coalition was unmoved, coming up with a bizarrely bureaucratic idea to give welfare recipients $100 through the payment system to allow them to buy their own. The idea was full of holes, and after a push by Queensland and Tasmania, the decision was made at national cabinet to instead give limited free tests to low-income earners through the pharmacy network. Regardless of the cost debate, the critical problem Australia currently faces is that there are no rapid antigen tests left to sell, let alone give away. At a key point in the pandemic, one of the critical tools for managing infection rates is missing in action. Why? The tests are cheap, and were widely available for sale on international markets last year. Various manufacturers in Australia were locking in contracts with overseas buyers because governments here were not interested, while other importers have been mired in the therapeutic goods approval processes. Morrison and other state and territory leaders have been quick to point out that Omicron is a game changer. No one is denying that. But even before Omicron, there were warnings about the need to secure rapid antigen tests. Health officials prepared advice in February last year that showed a transmission scenario where testing clinics would be overwhelmed. It suggested other testing methods could help sustain their capacity. The Australian Medical Association raised the issue in September, saying it was “bloody obvious” a RATs strategy was needed, and unions have likewise been calling for RATs to support workforce continuity. Morrison himself insists the commonwealth was wise enough to secure sufficient tests for “its responsibilities”, blaming the states for the national shortfall after the issue was raised in national cabinet in November. But when the health minister, Greg Hunt, was asked about the government’s plans for rapid antigen test availability last October, his response was to “let that market develop”. It is a staggeringly passive approach to take in the middle of a pandemic. Liberal governments always look to the free market for solutions, and every public intervention so far required in this pandemic has occurred despite it going against every ideological fibre of the Coalition. Government intervention remains counter-intuitive for Morrison, who sincerely believes that Australians naturally prefer a government-free life. But throughout the pandemic, government intervention – not the market – has kept the public safe. This is why Australia secured a national stockpile of masks and protective personal equipment early on in the pandemic, and prioritised the vaccine that had the ability to be made in Australia. It was the reason for lockdowns and border closures and vaccine mandates, and the reason that freedom-loving Australians have mostly accepted the necessity of a larger role for the state. Private retailers were never going to buy rapid antigen tests when there was no demand for them. Unlike governments, private companies have no obligation to prepare for public health emergencies. Letting the market develop has ultimately led to rapid antigen tests being sold for $50 on UberEats. That’s can-do capitalism for you. Letting the virus rip – which will now be unchecked by regular testing in several critical weeks of the Omicron wave – has resulted in unprecedented strain on the country’s health network as staff are furloughed. Nursing homes are closed. Elective surgeries are being cancelled. The promised economic revival is a fizzer, with supply chains disrupted, businesses closing down and spending back to lockdown levels. Restrictions that were abandoned prematurely are now being brought back in. With the peak of the Omicron wave still weeks away, Australia has lost count of case numbers, with no national system in place for reporting, and therefore no idea of what pressure will soon hit our health system. Australians were promised freedom, and with it a return to something resembling normality as we started to live with Covid. Instead, they have been left isolated and confused in a health crisis – and you can’t buy anything at the chemist for that.",News/Australia news,‘Living with Covid’ has turned Scott Morrison’s promise sour before the summer is out,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/08/living-with-covid-has-turned-scott-morrisons-promise-sour-before-the-summer-is-out
1/8/2022,"I’ve always been susceptible to bouts of nostalgia. Defined as “sentimental longing for the past”, nostalgia was originally identified as an emotion afflicting people who were separated from their homeland – a familiar feeling to someone who called four cities and two countries home by the age of 12. Modern researchers say nostalgia is experienced more or less the same way by everyone – across countries, ages and genders. “When people experience nostalgia, what they typically are doing is bringing to mind and revisiting memories that are special to them, or cherished, or particularly meaningful,” says Clay Routledge, a psychological scientist and professor at North Dakota State University.  Nostalgia appears to have become more prevalent in recent years – from political slogans that appeal to an idealised past to the rerelease of old video games on current devices. Streams of old music increased dramatically during the pandemic; sales of cassette tapes, records and their associated paraphernalia are booming; and even wired headphones are back, according to the Wall Street Journal (just a few months after I finally gave into their wireless counterparts). So what is driving this wave? There are two main triggers of nostalgia, Routledge says. The first are the “sensory inputs” that pull you back into a past experience. I have a plastic toy from my childhood with a very particular smell that for some reason lives in a tin inside my wardrobe. Whenever I open it and breathe in, I am transported instantly back to my bedroom at age six. The same thing might happen when you hear an old song on the radio, or if you see a friend post an old photo on social media. The second are psychological triggers, such as loneliness, sadness, anxiety or a lack of meaning in life. “When you’re feeling sad, that makes you more inclined to reflect nostalgically on the past because nostalgia helps you cope with those states,” Routledge says. Nick Bowman, an associate professor of journalism and creative media industries at Texas Tech University, told my colleague Josh Nicholas that playing old video games from your childhood can be a powerful short-term stress release. “In our research we found that people who have social nostalgia memories – memories of playing games with friends in the past – they feel connected to themselves and their friends in the past, and they also feel connected in the present,” Bowman says. The human tendency towards nostalgia has been amplified by the rapid technological change of recent decades. A lot of change has occurred in how we experience sensory inputs – advances in communication tools, photography, the way we watch films and listen to music, which create sensorially rich experiences. Take the old-school mix-tape, something that involves spending a bunch of time listening to music you love, in order to create something unique for someone you love. You can see how you might become nostalgic for such an emotionally heightened experience. And as Routledge points out, “a fair amount of [social media] is geared towards helping people connect with old friends or to share memories, and have these kinds of nostalgic experiences”. Then there is the psychological component. “As much as we like personal growth and development, we also have an orientation towards stability,” Routledge says. “We don’t want the world to feel chaotic … like the way things were five years ago is dramatically different from the way things are now. And so I think one of the things that rapid technological change can do is make people feel that sense of disorientation or discontinuity.” Add the disruption and extreme changes wrought by the pandemic, and you have the ideal psychological soup for nostalgia to arise. “It’s not any type of change – what we found is it’s specifically changes that make us anxious, or negative emotional changes,” Routledge says. “If it feels like a change that’s positive, then that’s fine, but when people feel disconnected in some important way, alienated or they’re just uncertain about the future, they tend to become more nostalgic.” This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, he says. While nostalgia can sometimes be a “barrier to progress” by painting a too-rosy and inaccurate picture of the past that can be “twisted and perverted by politicians”, he says we generally don’t really want to return to the past. “A lot of times, really at the core of it, is seeking some wisdom from the past – that we’ve lost something that maybe we can rehabilitate. People don’t really want to give up modern medicine, they don’t really want to give up automobiles, they don’t want to give up the social progress we’ve made on most things … What appears to be going on is nostalgia helps restore that feeling of stability. It gives people kind of the confidence, I think, to move forward.”",News/Technology,Years of rapid tech change and the pandemic disruption is driving a wave of nostalgia | Shelley Hepworth,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/08/years-of-rapid-tech-change-and-the-pandemic-disruption-are-driving-a-wave-of-nostalgia
1/8/2022,"With summer show capacities at 100% and festival season in full flight amid surging Covid numbers, arts lovers have been wrestling with a tough decision: should I use these tickets, or stay home? “The risk of severe disease from Omicron if you’re triple vaccinated is low,” says Hassan Vally, an associate professor of epidemiology at Deakin university in Melbourne, who has 20 years’ experience in epidemiology under his belt.  “But at the same time, you should do everything you can to limit your exposure, particularly in the next three to four weeks as case numbers peak.” “The next few weeks will be one of the worst times we’ve seen in terms of case numbers. If I hadn’t bought a ticket already, I wouldn’t be buying one now – especially if I was in an older age bracket or living with co-morbidities.” So what can we do to reduce our personal risks while we support our theatres and cinemas? Prof Vally answers some of our most pressing questions. Is it safe for me to sit in a theatre with 900 other people for three hours right now? If you choose to do this, you should be triple vaccinated, Vally advises. If you’ve just got your booster, wait a week. “The booster is an extra level of protection that would give you assurance over and above wearing a mask and socially distancing,” he says – although you should wear a mask and socially distance too. “And weigh up your personal circumstances. Are you in a vulnerable group or do you have regular contact with someone vulnerable? If that is the case, I would seriously consider staying home.” Am I safer in a big theatre with more air, or a small theatre with fewer people? Density matters, says Vally. “If you have 50 people in a small room and they are squashed together, that’s less safe than 1000 people in a big theatre if they are more spread out.” The riskiest time for infection is getting into your seat and getting out after the show, he adds. “That’s when people crowd together. A lot will depend on how theatres manage that.” What about eating and drinking in the foyer, and during the show? Skip the wine and skip the snacks, says Vally. Seriously. Particularly in the foyer. “The foyer is one of the highest risk areas. If you are serious about reducing your risk, keep a low profile in the foyer and don’t socialise. Just enjoy the show or movie and then get out.” “If everyone has their mask off in the foyer, and they are crammed together, it’s pointless taking all the other precautions,” Vally says, adding that conditions in the foyer are “messy”. What about going to the toilet? “I imagine the theatres have identified toilet queues as a really critical part of being safe in their safety plan,” Vally says. “Hopefully they have someone managing those lines and keeping everyone distanced. But if they don’t it’s back to personal responsibility. Make sure you keep your mask on, keep your distance and obviously wash your hands, for more than just Covid reasons!” What kind of mask should I wear? Any mask is better than no mask, though they do get significantly better from cloth, to surgical, to N95. “With Omicron so transmissible, I’d be using the best mask I could get my hands on,” says Vally. What should I do if the person I’m sitting next to pulls down their mask during the show? “That’s one of the hardest social problems we face,” Vally says. “I would assume the person has pulled their mask down and then forgotten to pull it back up, that’s so easy to do. So you can politely let them know they’ve let their mask slip down.” I have tickets to a standup comedy show. Is it less safe to be in a room of people laughing? This is where density limits are important, Vally says. “You want to keep your distance from people who are laughing a lot, because they are expelling a lot of air from their lungs. Wear the best possible mask and keep your distance as much as possible.” What’s the best way to get to the show? “Everything you do from the moment you walk out of the house, you are exposing yourself to risk,” says Vally. “If you go from your front door, into your car, drive to the car park and walk straight into the cinema or theatre, that is clearly a better situation then catching public transport and then being exposed to lots of people walking through a shopping centre.” It’s safer to drive, even if that’s less environmentally friendly. “In reality, this will be for a short period of time, so on balance, it’s better to drive or get an Uber than being on public transport and potentially being exposed to lots of people before you get to the cinema or theatre.” Is an outdoor cinema on a warm, still night better than an indoor one with air-con? The science is clear on this, says Vally. “Outdoors is much, much better than indoors. Your risks of being infected are reduced significantly by being outdoors. An outdoor cinema or outdoor play is ideal.” One of my children has been pinged as a close contact. Can I still go to the show? Technically, you are allowed to go because you are not a close contact yourself. But … you probably shouldn’t. “What we know about the virus in households, it would be responsible of you to limit all contact with other people until you were sure what their status is,” advises Vally. Check your local health guidelines on when you need to test and when to stop isolating. “A very small percentage of people may test positive beyond seven days because some people have a longer incubation period. But a decision has been made not to keep everyone in quarantine for longer because of that small risk,” Vally says. “This is a numbers game.” My children are under 12. Is it safe for them to see a movie or show without wearing a mask? Again, it’s about levels of risk. “If we are willing to accept some risk,” says Vally, “Then kids pose less of a risk than adults in terms of transmission and getting the virus themselves. It’s not a matter of safe or not safe, it’s just doing what we can to reduce the risks.” What point in my vaccination journey will be the safest time for me to go out? “You shouldn’t assume that just because you had your booster that morning you have increased protection immediately. Wait a few days or a week for it to kick in,” says Vally. “If you’ve already had two doses, you have fantastic protection against severe disease, and the booster is giving you even more.” Can I dance if I stay 1.5m away from anyone else? It depends on the ever-changing restrictions in your state – but if you’re going to that kind of event, take all reasonable precautions. “I hate to quote Greg Hunt, but don’t go into a moshpit,” says Vally. “Don’t do anything silly. If you’re outdoors you are safer … but if it was me, in the middle of a pandemic, I’d keep my distance and not dance among other people for the next few weeks at least.” There are now new indoor hospitality and entertainment density limits in Victoria and some in NSW, except for theatres and cinemas – why is that? Are they safer than other venues? The new rules recognise that theatres and cinemas are more of a “controlled environment” where people are not mingling, like they might be in a pub or nightclub. “In theatres and cinemas, people are masked and mostly seated in one place inside a well-ventilated indoor environment,” Vally says. “It is a pragmatic decision to help people get back to something close to normal.” I tested positive the day after being in the audience. What should I do? Firstly, do what the rules require you to do. “It would be a courtesy to let the theatre know, but the state health departments should do that and they need to factor in whether any further action is required,” Vally says. There is a glimmer of hope. “It’s been a long two years but we are turning the corner and we will be able to do everything again,” he says. “But we have to get through the period we are in right now. We are not in a no-risk environment now, there needs to be a level of tolerance. But it’s about not taking unnecessary risks.” Can you summarise all that for me? In short, your risk is cumulative. Think about going to the theatre or a cinema as involving a series of activities that all have risks associated with them: you have opportunities to reduce your risk. Wear the best possible mask and keep it on in the foyer. Limit your time in the foyer (stand outside) and limit the time with your mask off (skip the wine or the popcorn). Make sure you socially distance when you file into your seat and when you’re leaving the theatre, and don’t be shy asking people around you to remember to pop their masks back on. The aisles are high-risk bottleneck areas. Avoid queues. Do not lower your mask inside when the lights go down: keep it on. Think about how you travel to the theatre and how you get home. And think about other people too.",Arts/Culture,Plan to see a show or film?

1/8/2022,"Patients discharged early, cancer specialists diverted to Covid wards, non-Covid patients mixed in with infected ones: this is the bleak picture from inside New South Wales hospitals despite government officials stressing they would cope with the coming surge without need for another lockdown.The revelation comes as the share of double-vaccinated patients in intensive care units makes up the majority for the first time. Doctors, paramedics and patients say Friday’s decision to halt non-urgent elective surgery until February will only exacerbate health issues.  The premier, Dominic Perrottet, released government modelling on Friday that predicted Covid-related hospitalisations will peak between 3,000 and 6,000 patients by the third or fourth week of January. As of 8pm on Thursday, the tally stood at 1,738. “The modelling today is encouraging,” he told Friday’s media conference. “Even on a worst-case scenario, [NSW] is in a strong position to deal with the challenges that we face.” That confidence, though, is not shared by many within the health system. An increasing reliance on a fatigued workforce to perform roles beyond their expertise and experience risks reduced care and the prospect of medical errors, staff say. Even though Omicron is 50-70% less likely than the Delta strain to cause hospitalisations, its far higher infection rate means many more people will get it. Worryingly, as of 2 January, the percentage of those in hospital who were fully vaccinated has risen to 67.4%, according to data compiled by the health department’s critical intelligence unit. As of that date, fully vaccinated people made up 50.5% of the Covid patients in intensive care, becoming the majority for the first time. Hospitals are now being told to discharge patients faster, whether recovering from other ailments, such as strokes, heart attacks and trauma, or even Covid, a senior doctor said. “We’ve got to turn them over faster because there are so many more people needing beds,” the doctor said. Concord hospital, which earlier this week told staff to expect Covid patient numbers to triple, informed them on Friday “to discharge any patients we could”, another senior doctor told Guardian Australia. Senior staff at one of Sydney’s largest teaching hospital, meanwhile, described the current crisis they face as of “epic proportions”. NSW Health deputy secretary Susan Pearce told Friday’s press conference the government was “calling out everyone who is a registered health professional”, and said she would be willing to front up for duties herself if needed. “We’re looking at care assistants who can go in and help the more experienced staff,” she said. “We’re looking at bringing in, if possible, interns early. We’re looking at nursing graduates who may be able to be brought on early.” Pearce predicted “this [surge] will rise quickly and pass quickly. We also need to reassure our community that we will be able to manage this.” The altering of roles, however, is already affecting care. One woman due to undergo ovary removal soon as part of cancer treatment at a southern Sydney hospital now expects the operation to be bumped back. “My oncologist is rostered on [Covid duties] this month,” she said. The patient had hoped to have a lesion on her scalp seen by the specialist, a meeting that now won’t happen. “Just hoping it’s not a metastasis. What if it is?” For Alex Wilks, who took his wife, Kittie, to Gosford hospital’s emergency department on Monday to X-ray her badly swollen ankle, the issue wasn’t of a shortage of staff but a lack of Covid-safe facilities. “The staff were friendly and efficient and had the whole thing wrapped up in under four hours,” Wilks said. “However, they put her in an emergency room where there would normally be a bed and some privacy curtains; this room had three chairs. “They then put two clearly Covid-positive cases in there with her for the remainder of the three-four hours I am assuming this from the symptoms they had – coughing – and a conversation they had with the nurse: ‘So all your other family members who were at the event have tested positive?’ ‘Yes.’ “I have made a complaint with the hospital about it and am expecting a report on why my wife, who showed no symptoms of Covid, was exposed to the virus like this. They have assured me they will look into it and get back to me within 35 days. “I feel people need to know they are putting their lives at risk going to the hospital now.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from Gosford hospital. Patients who need ambulance care to attend hospital may also find wait times are getting longer. Chris Kastelan, the NSW president of the Australian Paramedics Association and a 24-year veteran of the service, said emergency department ramping or “bed block” was the worst for at least a decade. Staff are routinely working up shifts of up to 18 hours compared with the normal 12-hour stint. “And sometimes this is without a meal break,” Kastelan said. “That’s a bit of a safety concern.” The waiting period for an ambulance after making a triple-zero call now often stretches beyond 50 minutes because of the workload and crews available. Stage 3 escalation, when all training is halted and all registered paramedics – including executives – are asked to be on duty “was a bit of an anomaly in the past, but certainly it’s being hit more and more regularly”, Kastelan said. “I would suggest south-west Sydney and western Sydney are nearly in a constant state of stage 3 – the highest category before your workload outstrips your ability to provide service,” he said. Staff are being asked to cancel approved leave, while all long-service leave or leave without pay are not being approved, he said. Crews are preparing for the coming peak in Covid cases “with a level of trepidation”. “You can spend billions of dollars on infrastructure and new ambulances and equipment and a new headquarters and all those fantastic things, but I think at this point in time, we’re all recognising that the glue that holds it all together is people,” Kastelan said.

1/8/2022,"As Omicron spreads rapidly across Australia, states’ testing regimes have failed to keep up with surging demand and a lack of rapid antigen tests, meaning they are no longer capturing the true number of infections. As a result, data experts are concerned at the reliability of the figures being used to inform our decisions, with one saying that announcing daily case numbers at this point “feels completely arbitrary”.  They also warn incomplete information can hamper public health tactics as Australia enters the third year of the pandemic. With many people saying over the last couple of weeks that they tested positive to Covid on a rapid antigen test or had Covid-like symptoms but could not get a PCR test, it is difficult to say how many Australians have had the infection. There are estimates case loads could be up to 10 times higher than the daily figures announced. State health authorities have acknowledged their testing systems have not been capable of detecting the extent of transmission. The New South Wales chief health officer, Kerry Chant, reiterated on Friday that “the numbers of tests positive that we report everyday will be an underestimate”. “Across Sydney, we have got clearly a very high case burden,” Chant said. Earlier in the week, national cabinet announced an agreement to transition to accept rapid antigen test results as confirmation of Covid status, following weeks of so-called tourism testers and close contacts crippling the capacity of PCR labs. On Friday, NSW announced it would follow Victoria in introducing an online portal to report positive RAT results to improve accuracy. Aside from not capturing a true figure for new infections, the lowering of standards for collecting Australia’s Covid data will have flow-on effects on the country’s pandemic experience, says Juliette O’Brien, the data journalist who created covid19data.com.au. “There’s a giant asterisk next to any daily case number now, unless it’s from a state where it’s relatively under control. But on Friday, typing 38,000 for NSW sounds completely arbitrary,” she says. “There’s this huge caveat that we just don’t know what the real case numbers are, and an immediate issue is that we can’t calculate the true positive rate and reproduction rate. These are key metrics that show us when outbreaks are starting and when they slow down.” She says this changes the reliability of the data Australia contributes to international disease reporting efforts, and limits how much we can understand about the nature of the Omicron variant and future strains. O’Brien adds that while states are moving to record positive RAT results, the serious problems with cost and accessibility that have persisted over recent weeks and continue now means we have a less clear picture of the true growth rate. “Even though we see more cases reported each day, for all we know the rate of growth could be slowing. We are blind to that now.” Additionally, the emphasis on symptomatic people getting tested means we have stopped capturing information about asymptomatic cases, which can be important for our understanding of the severity of the strain. This is a departure from earlier in the pandemic, when asymptomatic cases were detected due to a thorough system of contact tracing and isolation. “When the country has abandoned any attempt to capture anything close to the real number of cases, that is the definition of out of control,” O’Brien says. Australian governments have relied on modelling to make public health decisions throughout the pandemic. However, the accuracy of much of the modelling released by health authorities has been mixed. During NSW’s Delta outbreak, hospitalisation predictions failed to materialise. Meanwhile, a worst-case scenario prediction made in mid-December that the state would reach 25,000 new daily cases by the end of January proved overly optimistic. Dr Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University infectious diseases modeller who is part of the Doherty Institute modelling consortium that advises Australia’s national cabinet, believes deteriorating quality of case number data will make the task “very difficult”. This is because without capturing the full picture of cases, modellers need to “calibrate” their models to other, related information where the data is complete. For example, death and hospital data continues to be “very well reported by the states”, says Lydeamore, and this can be compared with previous points in the pandemic when the accuracy of cases reported was better. That can help calibrate current case data to deliver a more likely number of true infections. Other methods of calibration will help to better understand the true caseload, such as surveying a sample of the population at a point in time, testing them for antibodies – an indication they’ve been infected – and recording their vaccine status. This enables the level of less severe infections to be better understood. However, these surveys have not been conducted in Australia. Lydeamore believes this type of surveying will be necessary in the future for Covid modelling to continue to be accurate and useful for the public health response.

As a result, health experts who provide health advice to governments will likely be more cautious in their recommendations, given the lack of clarity of the true transmission that is occurring. Whether governments adopt those more cautious recommendations is another question, says Lydeamore. “It’s clearly not a great situation.” Lydeamore says that health experts primarily measure vaccine effectiveness via randomised control groups. Participants receive the vaccine and their antibodies are measured at different stages to gauge how they have responded. While large-scale outbreak data is better understood when looked at with vaccine rates, Lydeamore says this is not the method used to determine vaccine effectiveness. However, information about the spread in specific areas where not everyone is vaccinated will be less clear, and “become a bit of a guessing game”.",News/Australia news,"Without reliable case data, how does Australia know where the pandemic is going?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/08/without-reliable-case-data-how-does-australia-know-where-the-pandemic-is-going
1/8/2022,"Lying with a cloth over her face, “unable to even look at things” in the worst sinus pain of her life, Johanna Roberts knew she was a “lucky” Covid-19 patient. “I could manage it by myself, I didn’t have to go to hospital.” Despite being as cautious as possible in the run-up to Christmas, Roberts, who lives in Sydney, tested positive for the virus in mid-December. She still does not know if it was the Delta or Omicron variant.  With hindsight, there is just one small silver-lining to her experience. She got sick before “everything completely went to hell”. “I had all the help I needed,” she says. “And I worry that people who have it now don’t have that. It’s just so extreme.” As Australia’s confirmed Covid-19 cases climb to dizzying new highs, with real numbers likely far higher, it can be difficult to ward-off a sense of fatalism. A feeling that, as New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said on Boxing Day, “we’re all going to get Omicron”. But health experts implore public vigilance, rather than defeatism. Federal vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Chris Moy, says: “When Hazzard went out and said we’re all going to catch it, I thought that was one of the most irresponsible statements ever.” He says it felt almost like an invitation, “because it did not have the caveat about what you should be trying to do.” “The idea is to slow this down as much as possible so we don’t all get sick at the same time.” Dr Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the George Institute for global health and the University of Sydney says that while Omicron is “unbelievably infectious”, that “doesn’t mean everyone has to get it, and it doesn’t mean everyone has to get it right now”. Prof Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician at the University of Sydney, says that taking a lackadaisical attitude toward Omicron is a dangerous gamble, even for the young and vaccinated. “Even if the majority of people will get Covid mildly and recover quickly, there remains an important minority who despite being relatively healthy will still get Covid severely, with hospitalisation and admission to intensive care.” While vaccinations work well for most people, most of the time, their protection against the virus is not flawless, and will not be the same for everyone, Booy says. There is no way of knowing which “healthy young person” will be “the unlucky one who will get Covid severely.” “This is a virus that’s still worse than influenza, it’s still more likely to kill you than influenza.” Right now, Booy says we are dealing with the fallout from “a whole month of dangerous behaviour, 30 days of Christmas and New Year’s Eve parties which have been super-spreader events.” He adds that in NSW, the pressure high case numbers have placed on the healthcare system makes this “a bad time to get sick”. The most important thing you can do is ensure all eligible members of your household are vaccinated. Booy says “Omicron … in kids or young adults is really worth preventing” and that the “benefit of vaccination is much greater than any side effects”. For adults “there’s a palpable and important difference” between being vaccinated and having a booster shot, so if you are eligible for a booster, get one. Booy says Omicron is “extremely unlikely to be devastating if you’re boosted. Only are you at great risk if you’re immunosuppressed and not able to respond to vaccine.” “A booster gives you great protection not only against severe disease but even against mild infection.” Beyond vaccination, Booy says: “We don’t have to be in lockdown but we have to be careful. You go to fewer events, you make sure they’re outside, ventilated, short in duration and few in number.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Martiniuk says that “we need to get ourselves back to the basics of infectious disease control”. While shoring up public health infrastructure like contact tracing and testing will make the biggest impact, on an individual level, she suggests people in areas with high case numbers limit the amount of time they spend in indoor venues, including grocery shopping, and try to reduce the number of people they see. She also suggests you “put a few days in between social gatherings” because “Omicron infects quite quickly.” Taking a beat between seeing people gives you time to “fall sick in between”, thus lowering the risk of spreading the disease to others before you know you have it. The short answer is no. “Even if you’ve had a booster, it’s about protecting other people,” says Moy. “We’ve all got to be in it together and not overcomplicate things.” “We need good, clear, simple instructions. Don’t overthink it, whether you’ve had it or had a booster, just practice good, common sense Covid-safe practices that we’ve known all along.” Booy agrees, saying that while those who have good Covid-19 immunity are a lower risk for transmitting the virus, a lower risk does not mean no-risk. “Your behaviour is not only about yourself, it’s about your community,” he says. Moy and Martiniuk say that there is not yet conclusive data on how much protection a previous Covid-19 infection, Omicron or otherwise, offers, against future Omicron infections, or other variants. However, Martiniuk says that it is “very clear” from “many people around the world that getting Covid-19 once does not prevent you from getting it again”. Booy says that “there’s no doubt that if you’ve recovered from Covid, on the back of being double vaccinated, you will have longer and stronger immunity”. But he says the risks associated with the illness far outweigh any potential benefits, saying “it would be crazy to have Covid parties”. Roberts, who is double vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 and was permitted to leave isolation just in time to see her family for Christmas. She says that having already been infected makes her slightly “less stressed” as she awaits her eligibility for a booster shot. But some small peace of mind is negligible compared to the “awful” experience of her mild case. “I would choose to not have it if at all possible,” she says. “I don’t recommend it as a holiday experience.”",News/Australia news,Should Australians be resigned to getting Omicron?

1/8/2022,"Senior lawyers have accused the attorney general for England and Wales of politically-driven meddling after she announced that she could refer the acquittal of the Colston Four to the court of appeal. Suella Braverman said she was contemplating the highly unusual move after an outcry from Conservative MPs following the jury’s verdict on four Black Lives Matter protesters who toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol.  A former director of public prosecutions and senior criminal lawyers were among those who warned that Braverman appeared to be acting out of political motivation. When someone has been acquitted of a crime, the attorney general has the power to seek the opinion of the court of appeal on a point of law, under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) 1972. Braverman did not specify the point of law she was concerned about. Four protesters were cleared of criminal damage after admitting that they helped topple the statue of Colston – a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas – in June 2020, but argued that its existence constituted a public offence or a hate crime. After Wednesday’s verdict, former cabinet minister Robert Jenrick suggested the rule of law had been undermined, while Tom Hunt, a vice-chair of the parliamentary Common Sense Group, said he was “deeply concerned by the precedent set here”, despite the fact that jury decisions do not set legal precedents. Writing on Twitter on Friday, Braverman said: “Trial by jury is an important guardian of liberty and must not be undermined. However, the decision in the Colston statue case is causing confusion. “Without affecting the result of this case, as attorney general, I am able to refer matters to the court of appeal so that senior judges have the opportunity to clarify the law for future cases. I am carefully considering whether to do so.” Simon Spence QC, of Red Lion Chambers, who prosecutes and defends serious crime cases, said: “The issue here as I see it is more that the attorney general does not like the jury’s verdict rather than that any point of law has arisen. The allegation was criminal damage, which is a very straightforward offence [for a judge] to direct juries about. My concern about this particular situation is that it appears to be politically driven rather than legally driven, and that is not what section 36 is intended for.” Spence and other lawyers the Guardian spoke to said they could not recall such a referral by the attorney general in similar circumstances. Ken Macdonald QC, who was director of public prosecutions from 2003 to 2008, said: “It is difficult to think of a case more appropriate to be decided by a randomly selected panel of local people. Juries have always been given the space to do what they think is right, sometimes by using their verdicts to assert changing values or to push back against abuses of power. This dispensation has served our country very well over the centuries, and ministers would be very foolish to try to challenge it – particularly for what appear to be political motives pushed by backbench Conservative MPs.” If the case does go to the court of appeal, the judges will not rule on whether the jury’s decision was correct, only on whether there was an error in law in the directions that were given to the jury. Depending on the appeal court’s opinion, it could affect how juries are directed on a particular point of law in future, but it would not lead to the Colston Four verdicts being overturned or a retrial. Kirsty Brimelow QC, vice-chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: “A politician is unlikely to have expertise in the laws governing direct-action protest and may not understand the statutory defences within the offence of criminal damage and so this could be a knee-jerk reaction, which is disappointing. I have not seen any specific criticism of the judge’s legal directions and route to verdict, which appear legally sound. “It is a concern that an impression is being given that the jury’s acquittal is being challenged. It is important to emphasise that the jury’s acquittal cannot be overturned and the defendants will remain not guilty – whether the attorney general attempts to utilise section 36 of the CJA or not. “However, it would be helpful for the attorney general to make clear that she respects the verdict of the jury and its right to return not guilty verdicts. After all, these verdicts are a sign of independent courts and a robust rule of law. This should be praised.” The shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, tweeted: “The attorney general has a duty to uphold democracy, the rule of law and the sanctity of the jury system, not play political games when she doesn’t like the results. I hoped Suella Braverman had learned a lesson after her shameful intervention on Barnard Castle, but clearly not.” Braverman faced calls to resign last year after she defended Dominic Cummings’ trip to Durham during lockdown. She was accused of pre-empting a police investigation into Boris Johnson’s then chief aide. Juries have an absolute right to acquit, which they have exercised in the past for protesters against climate change and military action, even when defendants have admitted causing disruption or damage, such as in cases of climate crisis protest. People who have used, grown or supplied cannabis for the purposes of alleviating pain have also been acquitted by juries in the past. Braverman, who became attorney general in 2020, was formerly a barrister specialising in planning law and judicial review. Her two immediate predecessors as attorney general, Geoffrey Cox QC and Dominic Grieve QC, were widely regarded as having been removed from office because they put their office’s legal independence above party politics.",News/Law,Suella Braverman accused of politically driven meddling over Colston Four,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/07/suella-braverman-accused-of-politically-driven-meddling-over-colston-four
1/8/2022,"The Conservative peer Michelle Mone referred a business to the Cabinet Office for potential multimillion pound PPE contracts before it had even been incorporated as a company, it has emerged. The business, PPE Medpro, was fast-tracked by the government through its “VIP lane” for politically connected firms following the referral by Mone.  Within weeks of the company’s incorporation on 12 May 2020, PPE Medpro was awarded contracts worth £203m to supply millions of masks and gowns. The Guardian revealed on Thursday that leaked files appear to suggest that Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in PPE Medpro, despite both consistently denying any “role or function” in the company. It has now emerged that Mone’s referral of PPE Medpro occurred five days before the company was formally registered. Responding to a recent parliamentary question from the late Labour MP Jack Dromey, health minister Edward Argar said: “Departmental records indicate that Baroness Mone identified Medpro as a potential supplier on 7 May 2020 and highlighted this opportunity by email on 8 May 2020.” Mone referred PPE Medpro to the office of her fellow Tory peer Theodore Agnew, a Cabinet Office minister responsible for procurement during the Covid pandemic. PPE Medpro was then added by Agnew’s office to the VIP lane, which analysis later showed gave companies a 10 times greater chance of being awarded a contract. PPE Medpro was not incorporated in the UK until 12 May 2020, five days after the initial referral. The UK company was effectively a subsidiary of another PPE Medpro, registered in the Isle of Man on 11 May. The director of both companies was Anthony Page, who works for Barrowman’s Isle of Man-based financial services firm and runs his family office. Lawyers for Mone, who ran a lingerie company before David Cameron made her a member of the House of Lords, have always said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. They also said she had no “association” with PPE Medpro, and “never had any role or function in PPE Medpro, nor in the process by which contracts were awarded” to the company. Contacted on Friday, Mone did not respond to questions about why she referred PPE Medpro the week before the company had even been incorporated. Both Mone and Agnew have declined to say what, if anything, she disclosed about her own links to the company when she referred it. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said Mone’s emailed referral is considered “private correspondence” that would not normally be publicly disclosed. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, wrote to Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay on Friday, expressing concern about “the lack of transparency around the award of significant sums of public money to PPE Medpro”. “I would ask now that the government … commits now to place all correspondence and records relating to the award in the library of the House [of Commons] for parliamentary scrutiny,” Rayner said in her letter. The timing of Mone’s referral of PPE Medpro also appears to be significant because it seems to have occurred days before the company had even secured the crucial business deal that enabled it to supply PPE to the NHS. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest it was not until 11 May – the same day the Isle of Man PPE Medpro was registered – that the company secured its agreement with a London importing company, Loudwater Trade and Finance. Under the terms of the business deal, documents suggest Loudwater promised to supply the PPE, whereas PPE Medpro appears to have committed to use its “extensive network to seek to secure … contracts with the NHS and other government bodies within the British Isles”. It appears PPE Medpro undertook that commitment just days after Mone had made the referral to the Cabinet Office. Documents seen by the Guardian also appear to show Barrowman was personally involved in setting up PPE Medpro’s deal with Loudwater’s director, Maurice Stimler, as well as related business matters. Barrowman’s lawyers have also repeatedly distanced him from the company, saying he was not an investor, director or shareholder. They have said the Guardian’s reporting amounted to “clutching at straws” and was “largely incorrect”. Mone’s lawyers have said the Guardian’s reporting is “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy”, adding: “She is under no obligation to say anything to you.” They have also said that that after she took the “very simple, solitary and brief step” of referring the company to Agnew, she “did not do anything further in respect of PPE Medpro”. However, WhatsApp messages believed to have been sent by Mone in late June 2020, over a month after the referral, appear to show her discussing the gown sizes and purchase order details with a person in PPE Medpro’s supply chain. The messages, which Mone appears to have sent shortly before taking off in a private jet, occurred shortly before PPE Medpro secured its second contract with the government. Mone’s lawyers said she could not be expected to comment on “unknown and unattributable WhatsApp messages allegedly sent 19 months ago”. Her lawyers have also refused to be drawn on why, according to a Financial Times report, Mone was in contact with officials as recently as February 2021, and appeared to be “incandescent with rage” over the treatment of PPE Medpro.",News/Politics,Michelle Mone referred company for PPE contracts five days before it was incorporated,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/07/michelle-mone-referred-company-for-ppe-contracts-five-days-before-it-was-incorporated
1/8/2022,"Citigroup is set to begin enforcing its “no jab, no job” policy next week, making it the first Wall Street bank to implement a vaccine mandate. The New York-headquartered bank said in October that it would require all US employees to be vaccinated against Covid as a condition of their employment in line with a Biden administration policy requiring workers supporting government contracts to be fully vaccinated.  The Biden policy has been widely challenged in the courts, and is currently before the US supreme court following requests by Republican state officials and business groups to block it. Citigroup also said it would examine requests for exemptions on religious or medical grounds, or any other accommodation by state or local law, on a case-by-case basis. More than 90% of Citigroup staff have so far complied with the mandate and that figure is rising rapidly, Bloomberg reported, citing a Citigroup spokeswoman. Citigroup, the news agency said, will place workers who do not comply on unpaid leave, with their last day of employment at the end of the month. The enforcement of “no jab, no job” on 14 January comes as Covid infections have surged in New York to five times last winter’s numbers – 59% thought to be of the highly transmissable Omicron variant. The decision to enforce the mandate comes as Wall Street banks have struggled to get employees back to their office desks after close to two years of remote working. Last month, JPMorgan, the largest US bank, told unvaccinated staff based in Manhattan to work remotely “until alternative solutions are considered” and said it was increasing restrictions on unvaccinated workers. In a memo sent to staff, first reported by Reuters, JPMorgan also urged bankers to get Covid vaccines and to receive booster shots, while relaxing mask policy to require they are worn requiring in lobby areas, elevators and in cafes when not eating. The memo, issued during a relative lull between the Delta variant and Omicron surge, said “it seems unfair” for vaccinated workers to wear face coverings indoors, adding that doing so would slow down its efforts for a return to normalcy. Citigroup’s move comes as New York’s leadership announced a policy designed to hasten workers’ return to their desks in office buildings that are estimated to be just 30% full. On Thursday, New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, standing beside the state governor, Kathy Hochul, proposed easing workers back into businesses with a three-day working week and then expanding to five days in New York City.“I say let’s start out with a three-day week, to let people see how safe it is to come back to work, then we cycle back into a five-day week,” he said. “We can do this within a three-week period and be up and operating in our city.”",News/Business,"Citigroup to terminate unvaccinated workers under ‘no jab, no job’ policy",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/citigroup-terminate-unvaccinated-workers-no-jab-no-job
1/8/2022,"British Gas owner Centrica has appointed the former government minister Amber Rudd as a non-executive director. The former home secretary also previously served as secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2015 to 2016 in David Cameron’s government during her decade as a Conservative MP.  Her recruitment comes amidan escalating energy crisis, with consumers bracing for household bills to soar in the spring, and as tensions grow between government and suppliers over how to lessen the impact of rising wholesale prices on households. Scott Wheway, Centrica’s chairman, praised Rudd’s “wide range of expertise” and said she would bring a “wealth of real-world experience in energy” which would be “invaluable” to the company. She was energy secretary at the time of the Paris climate change agreement made at the Cop21 summit in 2015. Centrica released news of Rudd’s appointment just hours after the company’s chief executive, Chris O’Shea, said it was not interested in receiving a government bailout to help it reduce the impact of soaring energy bills on consumers. “There are reports that some energy companies want a £20bn handout to keep household bills down,” O’Shea wrote in an opinion piece published in the Sun newspaper. “Not British Gas. We haven’t asked for a bailout, we don’t want a bailout, and we oppose any bailouts.” Consumers are bracing for a spike in what they pay for household energy in April, when the regulator reviews its energy price cap, a move that many expect will mean average annual bills shoot up by as much as £700. This increase would take the annual cost of electricity and gas for households on a supplier’s default tariff to £2,000, compared with £1,300 at present. After 26 UK energy firms collapsed in 2021, O’Shea insisted that “energy suppliers have to pass on higher wholesale costs to survive”. But he suggested the government could help consumers through other means, such as cutting VAT on energy bills, or stripping environmental levies from bills. He calculated that the VAT cut would shave £100 off the average annual bill, although such a move has been dismissed by Boris Johnson. O’Shea also suggested that the government should fund environmental and social levies through general taxation instead of household bills, which he estimated would cut the average annual total by £170. Rudd will join Centrica’s board on 10 January, and will also become a member of the company’s safety, environment and sustainability committee, as well as its remuneration committee. This is not Rudd’s first private sector role. She joined the ranks of former ministers stepping into often lucrative private-sector jobs after government when she was hired as a senior adviser to Cambridge-based cybersecurity firm Darktrace in May 2020, just as it prepared for its stock exchange flotation.",News/Business,British Gas owner appoints Amber Rudd as a director,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/british-gas-owner-appoints-amber-rudd-as-a-director
1/8/2022,"Sidney Poitier, who has died aged 94, was the first black actor to win an Oscar in a leading role, in 1964, for his performance in Lilies of the Field. This simple story about a handyman helping German nuns build a chapel in Arizona was enhanced by its star’s humour and vitality. It led to a string of successes – To Sir, With Love, In the Heat of the Night and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (all 1967) – which made Poitier a box-office star and consolidated his growing fame and wealth. But Poitier’s greatest achievement – alongside his friend and occasional rival Harry Belafonte – was to help alter the racial perceptions that dominated not just Hollywood, but also society in general. His success came against seemingly insurmountable odds. He was born two months prematurely into extreme poverty in Miami, where his Bahamian parents, Evelyn (nee Outten) and Reginald Poitier, had gone to sell their tomato crop. The family remained in the US for three months before returning to Cat Island, where Sidney spent his early childhood. They moved to Nassau in a vain search for a better life.  Sidney left school aged 13 to help support his family. A couple of years later, his parents sent him to New York to stay with an older brother. After a series of menial jobs, in desperation at the cold weather he joined the army – giving his age as 18. Having worked unhappily in a physiotherapy unit, he engineered a discharge, faking a psychiatric disorder. In an attempt to escape washing dishes for a living, he attended an audition at the American Negro Theater in Harlem where – virtually unable to read – he was firmly rejected largely because of a strong Bahamian accent. According to his autobiography This Life (1980), the turning point in Poitier’s mostly unhappy early years came with this rejection. For months afterwards he worked in restaurants and, through conversation and the radio, changed his speech so dramatically that on a second audition the group accepted him. He agreed to work as a cleaner in the theatre while doing his training. The tall, athletic and dazzlingly handsome Poitier was cast in an all-black production of Lysistrata in 1946, which was followed by another play, Anna Lucasta, and a role in a military documentary, From Whence Cometh My Help (1949), which introduced him to the screen. His Hollywood debut was No Way Out (1950); adding years to his age, he landed the role of a doctor who is racially harassed by a hoodlum. Despite good reviews, Poitier was hardly inundated with offers, since Hollywood was only just creating worthwhile supporting roles for black actors. He moved abroad for his next part, in Zoltán Korda’s rather ponderous version of Alan Paton’s novel Cry, the Beloved Country (1951), in which he played the Rev Msimangu in support of the veteran black actor and activist Canada Lee. The film was partially shot in South Africa, where Poitier was introduced to the horrors of apartheid, when he and Lee were housed outside town and segregated in all respects. A few minor roles followed, but Poitier mainly supported his wife, Juanita (nee Hardy), whom he had married in 1950, and children, by running a restaurant in New York. A turning point came when he was given the role of a student (cast 10 years below his true age) in Richard Brooks’ explosive Blackboard Jungle (1955). As a mixed-up kid, in a mixed-race school, he was at last in a hit movie – made famous by Bill Haley’s soundtrack, which featured Rock Around the Clock. He worked on the engaging Goodbye, My Lady (1956), directed by William Wellman and starring the child actor Brandon De Wilde, then Brooks cast him in Something of Value (1957), set in Kenya. But the parts were few and Poitier believed this stemmed from a political blacklist as well as racial discrimination. Another break came with A Man Is Ten Feet Tall (1957), an adaptation of a TV drama in which he had played the same role. His character, a dockworker, was something of a trademark Poitier part: good-hearted, tolerant (to a point) and a balance to the white lead (in this case, John Cassavetes). As Hollywood, rather than New York, belatedly tackled racial themes, Poitier gradually emerged as a star. After being noble in Band of Angels, and married to Eartha Kitt in The Mark of the Hawk (both 1957), which was funded by a religious group, he was offered a part in The Defiant Ones (1958). At the insistence of his co-star, Tony Curtis, Poitier shared top billing above the title – a breakthrough for the period. He and Curtis gained Oscar nominations for their roles as antipathetic convicts chained together and on the run, and Poitier received best actor awards at the Berlin film festival and from Bafta. A setback came with Porgy and Bess (1959), in which – contractually forced into playing Porgy – he was swamped by MGM’s lavish studio version of Catfish Row and Otto Preminger’s lumpen direction. In contrast, A Raisin in the Sun (1961) was a successful film of the groundbreaking play with which he had triumphantly returned to Broadway in 1959. Now in his 30s, Poitier achieved what other black actors only dreamed of – steady work in leading roles. The low-budget Lilies of the Field (1963) brought him not only an Oscar but also another award at the Berlin film festival. He became busier – to the detriment of his marriage, which ended in 1965 – with films including, that year, The Bedford Incident, in which he was cast as a journalist, a role that, significantly, did not depend upon his race. After a western, Duel at Diablo (1966), he played a teacher in the British-made To Sir, With Love, based on ER Braithwaite’s autobiographical bestseller. The movie proved a huge, unexpected, hit and Poitier, having negotiated a share of the profits to keep the budget low, became increasingly wealthy. That rather naive view of British school life was followed by two major successes. In the Heat of the Night offered him the role of Virgil Tibbs, the Philadelphia cop who falls foul of bigotry in a Mississippi town, where the racist southern sheriff (Rod Steiger) is at odds with the immaculate cool of the black detective. He and Steiger interacted superbly under the director, Norman Jewison. It was arguably Poitier’s best performance, but it was Steiger who got the Oscar nomination (and won). Stanley Kramer’s Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner completed a box-office hat-trick and further challenged race barriers. Poitier played a handsome doctor brought home by the daughter of a wealthy couple; his presence tests the parents’ liberalism, especially when the youngsters announce they are getting married. The movie is now routinely dismissed by critics as contrived and over-earnest. At the time, few considered it soft and Poitier soon found that it held the ring of truth when, after a long relationship with the black actor Diahann Carroll, he married the white actor Joanna Shimkus, provoking hostility from some quarters. Poitier co-wrote and starred in a romantic comedy, For Love of Ivy (1968), and followed it more controversially with The Lost Man (1969), co-starring Shimkus. A revamp of the classic Odd Man Out, it cast him as a black radical on the run – rather than the IRA fugitive of the 1947 original. Twice he revived his most famous role, in They Call Me Mister Tibbs! (1970) and The Organisation (1971). Sandwiched between these mediocre works was Brother John (1971), in which Poitier was cast as an angel descending on an Alabama town to see whether racism had lessened since his mortal time there. One can see why he was tempted by gutsier roles. To escape the rut he turned to direction, taking over Buck and the Preacher (1972), starring as a freed slave with his pal Belafonte (stealing the movie) as a conman priest. The film humorously upended many cliches. Several of the films he directed were as the result of a newly formed company, First Artists, with Poitier, Barbra Streisand, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman each undertaking to make several films within a specified time. Only Newman and Poitier maintained their quota. In fact, Poitier was to direct eight more films, starting with the sentimental A Warm December (1973) and ending with the lamentable Ghost Dad (1990). Few were as enjoyable as his debut, although some – notably Uptown Saturday Night (1974), A Piece of the Action (1977) and Stir Crazy (1980) – were commercial hits. Their greatest, if oblique, value was in giving sustained work to fellow black actors. Towards the end of the 1970s Poitier moved to semi-retirement and his acting parts, including The Wilby Conspiracy and Let’s Do It Again (both 1975), were hardly satisfying. He narrated a documentary about his hero Paul Robeson and stayed off screen for several years. In 1988 he re-emerged in a brisk thriller, Little Nikita, playing an FBI agent on the track of spies. The film co-starred River Phoenix, with whom he reunited in the enjoyable caper Sneakers (1992). The same year he also received the American Film Institute’s life achievement award – the first black actor to receive the accolade. It ushered in another busy period, including To Sir, With Love II, made for television in 1996; a portrayal of Nelson Mandela in Mandela and De Klerk (1997), also for television; and the political thriller The Jackal (1997), in which he played the FBI’s deputy director. He published two more memoirs, The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography (2000) and Life Beyond Measure: Letters to My Great-Granddaughter (2008). In 2002, almost 40 years after his groundbreaking Academy Award victory, he was awarded an honorary Oscar for his performances on screen and “for representing the industry with dignity, style and intelligence”. This view was echoed not only in his numerous awards for acting. In 1974 he had been given an honorary knighthood; in 2009 he received, from Barack Obama, the US presidential medal of freedom; and in 2016 he was awarded the Bafta fellowship. He also served as the non-resident Bahamian ambassador to Japan between 1997 and 2007 and was concurrently the Bahamian ambassador to Unesco. A daughter from his first marriage, Gina, died in 2018. He is survived by Joanna and their daughters, Anika and Sydney Tamiia; and by three other daughters, Beverly, Paula and Sherri, from his first marriage.

1/8/2022,"A petition to revoke the knighthood recently awarded to Tony Blair has reached 1m signatures in just six days. Blair was made a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior British order of chivalry, in the new year honours list.  But the honour for the former prime minister has provoked controversy. On Friday afternoon, the Labour MP Richard Burgon tweeted: “It says a lot about what is wrong with our system when, after being one of the leading architects of the Iraq war, Tony Blair is honoured with a knighthood while Julian Assange, who exposed war crimes in Iraq, faces extradition to the USA and a lifetime in prison.” However, the current Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has defended his predecessor’s record and said the honour was deserved, highlighting Blair’s achievements including bringing in the national minimum wage, setting up Sure Start centres for families and his efforts over the Northern Ireland peace process. After the petition passed 500,000 signatures on Tuesday, Starmer said: “I understand there are strong views on the Iraq war. There were back at the time and there still are, but that does not detract from the fact that Tony Blair was a very successful prime minister of this country and made a huge difference to the lives of millions of people in this country.” Angus Scott, who started the petition, wrote on Change.org: “Tony Blair caused irreparable damage to both the constitution of the United Kingdom and to the very fabric of the nation’s society. “He was personally responsible for causing the death of countless innocent, civilian lives and servicemen in various conflicts. For this alone he should be held accountable for war crimes.” On Thursday, as the petition approached 800,000 signatures, Scott thanked signatories on behalf of “families of soldiers who died in both Iraq and Afghanistan”. He added: “For this petition to have any chance of having an effect, we must all unite to push it over 1m signatures. We can only do that if each and every one of you does your ‘bit’ to share the petition as widely as you can, to everyone you know and encourage them to do the same.” Petitions on the parliament website are considered for debate by MPs if they pass 100,000 signatories, but petitions on Change.org, which describes itself as “the world’s platform for change”, have no more than a moral force. Blair, who left Downing Street more than 14 years ago, was one of three new appointments to the Garter announced by the palace. Such moves are in the Queen’s gift, made without prime ministerial advice; and they are for life. Among those to have given their backing to the petition is Rose Gentle, whose 19-year-old son, Gordon, was killed by a roadside bomb in Basra in 2004. She told the Daily Record that she had written to the honours committee to ask for an explanation for Blair’s knighthood. “Instead of standing in front of the Queen being made a Sir with that stupid grin on his face, he’d be better going to the cemetery and standing in front of my son’s grave to see what he’s done,” she said.",News/Politics,Petition to revoke Tony Blair’s knighthood hits 1m signatures,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/07/petition-to-revoke-tony-blairs-knighthood-hits-1m-signatures
1/8/2022,"Cyber Ninjas, the firm that was contracted by Arizona Republicans to carry out a widely-criticized review of 2.1m ballots cast in the presidential election, is shutting down amid a legal battle seeking to force the company to make documents from the review public.  A judge fined the company $50,000 a day on Thursday – 50 times the amount requested by plaintiffs – for failing to comply with a court order to turn over public records, in a lawsuit brought by the Phoenix-based Arizona Republic newspaper. During the same hearing, a lawyer representing Cyber Ninjas, Jack Wilenchik, begged the judge to allow him to withdraw from representing the firm. He said he had not been paid for his work and that the company was insolvent. Rod Thomson, a spokesman for the company, confirmed in an email on Thursday evening that the company was shutting down. He said Doug Logan, the founder and chief executive who oversaw the review after expressing support for the disinformation pushed by Donald Trump and allies that the 2020 election was stolen by the Democrats, was no longer with the company. “Doug Logan and the rest of the employees have been let go and Cyber Ninjas is being shut down,” he said in an email. He did not respond to questions about why the company was closing. John Hannah, the local judge overseeing the case, warned that the firm could not escape having to turn over documents by shutting down. “The court is not going to accept the assertion that Cyber Ninjas is an empty shell and that no one is responsible for seeing that it complies,” he said, according to the Arizona Republic. The shutdown marks an abrupt turn for a company that led an effort Trump and allies around the country once saw as their most promising effort to prove widespread irregularities in the 2020 election. The effort raised a staggering $5.7m from outside groups. State lawmakers from around the country flew to Phoenix to watch the effort in person and pushed to replicate it elsewhere. This despite other officials at every level declaring the election the most secure in US history, and eventually William Barr, the then US attorney general, saying the Department of Justice had not uncovered evidence of voter fraud that would change the outcome of Biden’s victory in the November ballot. But the Arizona review, which began last April and largely concluded last fall, was quickly beset by shoddy methodology, bizarre practices, and infighting. Its final report in September not only affirmed Biden’s victory in Maricopa county, Arizona’s most populous and the location of the state capital, Phoenix, but also raised questions about election equipment being connected to the internet and mail-in ballot processing procedures. Nearly all of the claims the firm made in its month-long review were debunked on Wednesday in a 93-page document authored by election officials in Maricopa county, where Cyber Ninjas did its review. “Nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws,” the county wrote in its rebuttal. A claim that there were thousands of suspicious duplicate images of ballot envelopes, for example, was easily explainable, the county said. If a ballot comes in with a missing or faulty signature, election officials contact the voter and help them fix it. When the ballot is resubmitted, it is scanned again before being sent to be opened. “Only one ballot was counted for each envelope,” the county said. The report also includes a lengthy technical analysis debunking claims from Cyber Ninjas that its election equipment was connected to the internet. Out of the 2.1m votes cast in the county, officials acknowledged potentially double-counting 50 ballots and said they were referring 37 cases to the attorney general’s office for further investigation for potential voter fraud. Karen Fann, the president of the Arizona senate who was a staunch supporter of the Cyber Ninjas review, seized on those few irregularities to claim the audit was worthwhile. “From day one, the Arizona senate’s efforts have been in pursuit of a singular goal – identifying and implementing improvements to our election’s processes,” she said in a statement. “Although it took 14 months and a costly audit, Maricopa county yesterday joined us in pursuit of this worthwhile objective.” Her statement did not mention two of the most important, and obvious facts from the audit – that Joe Biden won Arizona and the original election results were accurate.",News/US news,"Cyber Ninjas, firm that conducted Arizona election ‘audit’, shuts down",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/cyber-ninjas-arizona-election-audit
1/8/2022,"The decision by a jury in Bristol to acquit the “Colston Four” of criminal damage, following their role in the toppling of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in June 2020, is a welcome sign that Britain is changing. In the 17th century Colston was one of Britain’s wealthiest slave traders. It speaks volumes about what Bristol’s Victorian civic leaders valued when they decided to erect a monument to Colston in 1895, almost a century after the slave trade was abolished (decades before slavery itself). Just 12 years earlier, a second statue of William Wilberforce, who campaigned for slavery’s abolition, was erected in his home city of Hull. Yet in the south-western English port, whose wealth was built on the flesh trade, it was seen as fit to honour Colston with a monument, and a plaque describing him as “virtuous and wise”. The prosecution should never have been brought, and perhaps would not have been had the home secretary, Priti Patel, and other ministers, been less vociferous in their condemnations of the protests, which culminated in Colston’s statue being dumped in the harbour. It is far from clear that this use of the state’s resources was in the public interest. Six other activists were dealt with via a “restorative justice” route, including voluntary work.  Objections to the Colston statue, which occupied a prominent position in Bristol’s centre, were longstanding, and part of a wider, local movement to remove tributes to the slave trader from the city (including the renaming of its main concert hall). That feelings among a section of the public finally boiled over was because of the passionate objections to racial injustice aroused by the Black Lives Matter demonstrations following the murder, less than two weeks earlier, of George Floyd. The verdict is not, as one of the defendants herself pointed out, a green light to “start pulling down all the statues in the UK”. Colston was a particular person. His monument belongs to a specific time and place – and is now in a Bristol museum, thus demolishing the idea that taking it down was an effort to “erase” the past. What the jury’s decision shows is that members of the public are more than willing to think about the messages embedded in our built environment, including monuments – so many of them Victorian. They accepted the defence’s case that it was the presence of the statue, and failure to update the plaque, that constituted a moral – if not a legal – offence. Reckoning with the past is difficult. Britain was once an empire that governed vast areas of the world. Astonishing levels of greed and cruelty are part of our history, along with a religiously motivated “civilising” mission that sought to export Christianity across the globe. Everyone who cares about knowledge should support efforts to increase public understanding of all this. In organisations across the country, including the National Trust, good work is being done. Yet up to now, the government has set its face against anything that might make heritage less celebratory, condemning as “woke” all attempts to place artefacts such as those that fill British country houses (and city squares) in a broader context. Its repressive police bill seeks to increase prison sentences dramatically for those convicted of criminal damage (at present, the maximum for causing damage worth less than £5,000 is three months). Statues are symbols, and tackling racism requires more than moving them. But acknowledging historic injustices is part of building a more equal society today. Rather than complaining about the way in which the law has been applied, as some ministers have done, the government as a whole should think again. Britain is better off without Bristol’s monument to Colston.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the ‘Colston Four’: taking racism down | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-colston-four-taking-racism-down
