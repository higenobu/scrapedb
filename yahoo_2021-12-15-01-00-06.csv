12/15/2021,"(Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is threatening to pull out of a $23 billion deal to buy American-made F-35 aircraft, Reaper drones and other advanced munitions, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. The Gulf ally complained that U.S. security requirements were too onerous, the report said, citing American officials. F-35 contractor Lockheed Martin Corp, the U.S. State Department and the UAE foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The UAE signed an agreement with the United States to purchase 50 F-35 jets and up to 18 armed drones, people familiar with the situation told Reuters in January. The UAE, one of Washington’s closest Middle East allies, had long expressed interest in acquiring the stealthy F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin, and was promised a chance to buy them in a side deal when it agreed to normalize relations with Israel in August 2020. On Dec. 4, a UAE defence ministry official said that a deal to purchase French Rafale fighter jets would complement the Gulf country's planned deal to buy the American-made F-35 warplanes and was not a replacement for them.

12/15/2021,"Is Donald Trump starting to lose his grip on the Republican Party? National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar recently listed a few data points that suggest that his glow may be fading. First, Trump’s endorsed candidate, Sean Parnell, was forced to drop out of the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania. Second, Trump’s endorsed U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama, Rep. Mo Brooks, is losing ground to a younger candidate named Katie Britt. Third, the much-hyped Trump-Bill O’Reilly tour kicked off with a lot of empty seats. And fourth, Trump’s endorsed candidate in a Texas special election, Susan Wright, was defeated in a race to replace her late husband. A fifth example, if I may, is in North Carolina, where, The Hill reports, “Despite winning the former president’s endorsement early on, [Rep. Ted] Budd has so far failed to become the runaway favorite in the GOP primary and has regularly trailed his chief rival, former Gov. Pat McCrory, in polling.” This doesn’t mean that Trump won’t be the 2024 nominee, but a Pew survey conducted in September (published in October) shows that just 44 percent of Republicans want him to run for president again (and 32 percent want him out of politics altogether). Trump and Bill O’Reilly Tour Kicks Off With Many Empty Seats The New York Times’ Jonathan Martin called the majority of Republicans who don’t want him to run again the “gold watch constituency.” Like Mötley Crüe sang, “Don’t go away mad (just go away).” Before we get too carried away, some caveats are in order. Trump’s lack of coattails isn’t new, and defeating a Trump-endorsed Republican isn’t the same thing as electing a “Never Trump” Republican. Remember, in 2020, Trump’s endorsed candidate was thumped by Madison Cawthorn in a North Carolina runoff. Likewise, in March of 2020, Trump tweeted that voters should throw Thomas Massie out of office. Last I checked, Massie was still in office (and sending ridiculous Christmas tweets of his family with guns). While it would be naive to believe the Republican Party will ditch Trump and go back to Zombie Reaganism, it would be likewise silly to assume the current paradigm will remain trapped in amber. George Will has been saying that our best hope may be that Americans have short attention spans and get bored easily. He has a point. Anecdotally speaking, many of the same people who were the most passionate evangelists for George W. Bush’s “compassionate conservatism” 20 years ago were ready to call Dubya a war criminal by 2016. Times change, and new characters are introduced into this political drama. We’re already seeing hints that, to some extent, the party is already moving on to younger leaders like Tucker Carlson and Ron DeSantis. I’m old enough to remember when Sarah Palin was the straw that stirred Republicans’ drinks. Posting stories about her got clicks. She flirted with running for president (to sell books and stay relevant) and even got the media to chase her bus around the country. But she chose not to run for president (after choosing to step down as governor of Alaska), and eventually she became old news (for those who want Trump to go away, this is an admission against interest: If Trump’s goal is to continue garnering attention, he needs to run for office again). Now, it’s true that Palin did not possess Trump’s resources or media savvy (nor was she president), but her prime shelf life lasted for about four years (2008-2012). At age 75, Trump is on year seven of largely dominating the news. How long can he keep it up? At the end of the day, Trump faces the same existential threat we all do: mortality. In his case, this means both his literal and political life. Conventional wisdom suggests that Donald Trump is unstoppable in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, and that his hold over the party is absolute. But as Chris Christie advised Sunday on This Week (or was it Axl Rose?), “Everybody needs to have some patience.” Trump, Christie noted, is hampered by the fact that he has no social media presence (whether it’s prudent that social media companies have the power to remove political figures is worthy of its own discussion), and keeps doing things like attacking former Israeli Prime Minister (and conservative hero) Benjamin Netanyahu. The spell will eventually break, but as Christie says, “It’s not going to happen overnight.” Christie, who decided not to run in 2012, and flamed out in 2016 (leading to his endorsement of Trump), wants to be elected president in 2024. This is to say, he has a conflict of interest when it comes to analyzing Trump’s staying power. But that doesn’t mean he’s wrong. Trends come and go, and people get swept up in them before moving on to the new, hot thing. Americans have a bias towards newness. Thrice-married Trump should appreciate this concept as the country looks like it finally might be ready to turn the page. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

12/15/2021,"Mary Trump attributes her cousin Donald Trump Jr.’s texts during the U.S. Capitol riot to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to one thing: “cowardice.” Trump Jr. was among multiple conservative figures who pleaded with Meadows to get then-President Donald Trump to call off the violence from his supporters, according to text messages released Monday by the House select committee investigating the insurrection. “He’s got to condemn this shit ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,” Trump Jr. wrote to Meadows. “I’m pushing it hard,” Meadows replied. “I agree.” “We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now,” Trump Jr. continued. “It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.” MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell asked Mary Trump why Trump Jr. texted Meadows and not his own father. “I wish that the answer you had given was the right one ― caller ID,” she cracked in response. “But in this particular instance, it’s simply cowardice, because Donny knew that the message he was delivering was the message his father did not want to hear.” Mary Trump predicted her uncle will lash out at the release of the messages. But his inner circle has “become so small” there may not be anyone left for him to fire, she noted. Watch the interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

12/15/2021,"LeBron James said he drinks wine every day because he once heard it's good for his heart. Wine does contain antioxidants and resveratrol, which lowers cholesterol and prevents blood clots. But drinking too much alcohol every day can ultimately cause more damage to the heart than good. LeBron James said he drinks wine every night, and he believes it helps his heart. The 36-year-old NBA superstar told ESPN that he regularly drinks wine and is still able to play the best basketball of his life, and does so for the benefit of his heart. ""I've heard it's good for the heart,"" James said. ""Listen, I'm playing the best basketball of my life, and I'm drinking some wine pretty much every day. Whatever it is, I'll take it."" It's a common myth in health that has some seeds of truth, but experts say it's not as simple as that, and drinking wine so often can be detrimental. While wine is a mainstay in some of the healthiest societies in the world, research suggests drinking alcohol every day can have a detrimental effect, slowing down injury recovery and hindering athletic performance. James didn't always have his wine habit, as he previously said he ""was not a wine guy"" and never drank wine at all until after he turned 30, in an interview with ESPN. James said he developed such a love for wine, that he even let his seven-year-old daughter try it when she was younger. James isn't alone — other NBA players like Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and Devin Booker are also big wine drinkers these days. When grilled about his love of wine, James said he's played his best basketball while drinking wine every day over the last six years. He's made every All-Star game since turning 30 in 2015, and has improved in minutes played per game, points per game, rebounds per game, and assists per game in that time. This year James has missed 12 games due to ankle and abdominal injuries, and his rebound and assists numbers have decreased. James' point about using wine for his heart health does have some scientific basis. Margarita Rohr, a cardiologist who is also the clinical instructor of medicine at NYU Langone Health, told Insider that red wine has antioxidant properties that may make blood less likely to form clots. Wine contains certain antioxidants that can help prevent coronary artery disease and heart attacks. This is because it contains micronutrients, called polyphenols, which are found in the skin and seeds of grapes. Polyphenols called resveratrol can support heart health. Polyphenols in red wine also have antioxidant properties. They can prevent or slow down the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, which is the ""bad"" cholesterol in our blood. But it also increases the amount of high-density lipoprotein, which i the ""good cholesterol"" in our blood. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no more than one glass (140 ml) of wine a day for women and two a day for men. By that measure, James is within the guidelines. But Rohr said any more than that, on a regular basis, can start to impact the cardiovascular system. ""Drinking alcohol in excess can be harmful to the heart and with excess consumption over an extended period of time, can lead to alcoholic cardiomyopathy,"" Rohr told Insider. ""This is a heart condition that affects the heart muscle directly and can cause heart failure."" Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to high blood pressure and raise levels of triglycerides, which can increase your risk of heart disease, heart attack, stroke, or heart failure.

12/15/2021,"Imagine this: You sit down for an amazing home-cooked meal, featuring all of your favorites. All the food looks as wonderful and fresh as it ever has. Yet, there's something wrong. The smell doesn't pique your hunger — instead, a whiff of what should be a delicious dining experience makes you nauseous. And the first bite? Well, it's almost inedible. While the textures are still reminiscent of what you once knew, the taste can only be compared to sewage, garbage or maybe even gasoline. If this sounds like a curse or something out of a Stephen King novel, it's not. It's a symptom associated with COVID-19 called parosmia — and, according to many people who say they've experienced it, it typically starts weeks to months after the initial infection. The loss of smell and taste has long been associated with COVID-19 — it was one of the earliest symptoms associated with the virus that differentiated it from other illnesses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a change in taste and smell is on the list of potential long haul COVID symptoms. Per the CDC, the symptom can occur in even those who have had mild illness.  Yet despite its place on the CDC website, the change in taste and smell after the initial COVID infection subsides has been discussed much less than the loss of taste and smell during infection. The condition, however, can lead to major health issues, from malnutrition to psychological issues surrounding food. Social media, however, is opening up a conversation that those suffering from this condition say is long needed. Natalia Cano, a 20-year-old student at American University, was in tears when she took to TikTok this fall to discuss her parosmia symptoms, which have plagued her for 10 months. Her original video received more than 13 million views. Cano has since made others to shed light on her symptoms. For Cano, water never tastes clean. The smell of deodorant is as severe as spray paint. Most importantly, nearly all food and beverages — save for a few ""safer"" options — make her nauseous. Cano says she forces herself to eat two Cliff Bars a day — not because they don't taste terrible, but because they're quick to scarf down. Cano tested positive for COVID in the early days of 2021, while working at a bakery. While she recovered from the virus itself, she began experiencing serious gastrointestinal issues, alongside a particularly unusual symptom: a change in her taste and smell. The GI issues have since resolved, but Cano is still living with parosmia, which she says is affecting not only her eating habits but also her mental health. Her TikTok, she says, was posted out of frustration — she had just gone to the dining hall with friends, only to find that there wasn’t any food in the cafeteria she could stomach. ""Things taste like garbage. Like sewage,"" Cano tells Yahoo Life. ""But it's not like it actually tastes like garbage or sewage, that's just the only way I can compare it to people. It's like I've been given this bad taste. It's the same amount of bad as rotting meat, garbage, sewage, but it doesn't taste like that."" Cano said it's been frustrating trying to find foods she can stomach — especially since there's little rhyme or reason to what tastes good. Things regularly shift. One day, California rolls were acceptable — the next, intolerable. These days, she says she can handle pulled pork sandwiches (possibly because of the sugar content, she suspects, as candy and Dr. Pepper isn't so bad, either), as well as strawberry yogurt. ""Every time I put something into my mouth, I know what it's supposed to taste like, and then it tastes disgusting,"" Cano says. ""It's always just out of reach. I don't want to get used to this because I remember how good things used to be."" The experience has made Cano feel isolated — but TikTok has shown her she's not alone. Cano said there were ""thousands"" of people in her comments section experiencing these symptoms. Though she was told by a doctor that parosmia was a symptom of long haul COVID, she never expected so many people to be suffering in the same way she is.  ""I thought maybe there were five people in the country who had this,"" she says. ""I didn't know there were so many people. It's shocking to me to find out how many people actually have this because I'm wondering, ‘Why are we all suffering in silence? Why aren't we talking about it?'"" One such person is Jessica Cox, a 27-year-old producer, who made the connection between her January 2021 bout with COVID and her parosmia after seeing Cano's video. ""Everything tasted like one rotten thing — I don't know what that rotten thing is, but it’s a nasty taste and smell,"" Cox tells Yahoo Life. ""I would just be walking and I would smell that nasty smell, and I didn't know where it was coming from."" It was only recently that Cox said she's been able to taste and smell more normally. However, things aren't how they were before COVID. “I'll eat a blueberry, and it just doesn’t taste exactly like how I remember it,"" Cox says. ""It doesn't taste rotten, but it doesn't taste exactly like a blueberry"" used to. While Cox has regained function, she shares that her experience with parosmia has led her to develop an eating disorder. ""I didn't connect the eating disorder to my COVID symptoms until I saw [Cano's] TikTok,"" Cox says. ""I love food, but being unable to enjoy food for those months has changed things. My appetite went away. I don't enjoy food now. Yesterday, I woke up at 9 a.m., and I didn't eat until 8 p.m. I don't have an appetite. I don't think about food. When I do, I get nauseous, I start gagging — that's an everyday thing."" Ashley Zibetti, a 27-year-old photographer, has also taken to TikTok to share her story of parosmia. While her taste and smell symptoms subsided eight or nine months after her experience with COVID, they came on full force when she became pregnant. Now, they're worse than ever — like Cano and Cox, nearly everything tastes and smells rotten to her. She lost 20 pounds during her first trimester and says parosmia has also led to depression. ""We associate smells in our life with joy,"" Zibetti tells Yahoo Life. ""For me, right now, I'm worried that I won't be able to enjoy my baby when she comes — her newborn baby smell, things like that. I'm a big foodie, and it’s sad I can't go to restaurants without feeling nauseous. That’s how we connect with our friends. It’s a way I connect with my husband — we love going out to eat for date nights, and there was a long period of time where we had to avoid anywhere that involved food."" She adds: ""It’s hard, because there’s a lot of happiness and joy surrounding smelling things and tasting things, and that’s all gotten taken away from me.” Zibetti is far from alone. According to Dr. Zachary Rubin, a Naperville, Ill.-based pediatrician who specializes in allergy treatment and immunology and works with Team Halo to address COVID-19 misinformation, it's a very common symptom of COVID-19. Between 30 and 60 percent of people who lose their taste and smell due to COVID will later experience it again, Rubin tells Yahoo Life.  ""While this is not fully understood, smell loss is most likely due to direct damage from the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the olfactory nerve that senses smell, local inflammation and damage from our own immune system combating the virus, or both,"" Rubin explains. ""Following this damage, this nerve is attempting to regenerate, but the nerves are most likely not connecting to the same place as before."" In a world where COVID has already affected millions of people — and, unfortunately, shows little sign of slowing down — there will be more and more people dealing with parosmia, as well as other unusual long haul symptoms of the virus. Speaking out about the detrimental effects is therefore important so that treatments can be researched. So why aren't more people talking about it? It may be because it exists in an interesting middle ground — it's unusual enough to send off alarm bells to people who don't take COVID seriously, but may be shut down by those who don't think it's serious enough to discuss.  While Cano has received support on social media, she's also received hurtful comments from both of these sides. ""There are people who are like, 'I can see fake crying from a mile away. You're a paid actor from Moderna, from the CDC,'"" Cano says. ""Then there are people who are saying 'You need to get over it, there are people who are dying, this doesn’t affect you that much.' Meanwhile, it's preventing me from doing things that are basic for human survival. It's turning into a serious, chronic health condition."" Cox, meanwhile, doesn’t think people get the severity of the symptoms — and some have even joked about its ""upside."" ""I've told people before and they're like, 'Wow, that's really cool, you should be losing a lot of weight since you’re just eating to survive,'"" Cox shares. ""I don't know why people are so obsessed with that. I would 100 percent rather have my sense of taste and smell than lose weight. It's not worth it."" For now, all three women still experience parosmia to a certain degree. But they remain hopeful that their lives will go back to normal one day. ""There’s been a lot of people in the comments section saying 'Hey, don’t be discouraged, I’ve had this for a year and a half, and it magically got better,'"" Cano shares. ""There were other people who said that if you got parosmia from a virus, it was unlikely to last more than two years, so that gave me some hope."" Cano adds: ""I think, after two years, if it’s still this bad, I’m going to have all these feelings again, maybe worse. But there have been people who said, 'I've had this, and it's gone away.'"" —Video produced by Katarina Vasquez.

12/15/2021,"In March, Jenna Ryan tweeted that she wouldn't be imprisoned because she's white and blond. She received a lot of backlash for the tweet, which a judge cited during her sentencing. Ryan told Insider the backlash had made her afraid to speak her mind. In March, Jenna Ryan posted a tweet boasting that she was blond, white, and ""definitely not going to jail."" Nine months later, she says the backlash she got for that tweet is making her feel silenced. When a critic on Twitter told Ryan, who had been charged in the Capitol riot, that she would go to jail, she responded: ""Definitely not going to jail. Sorry I have blonde hair white skin a great job a great future and I'm not going to jail. Sorry to rain on your hater parade. I did nothing wrong."" She has since pleaded guilty to parading on Capitol grounds. Last month she was sentenced to 60 days in a minimum-security federal prison in northern Texas. At her sentencing, Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the US District Court for the District of Columbia said, according to The Washington Post: ""You've been very upfront that you feel no sense of shame or guilt. You suggested antifa was somehow involved. And perhaps most famously, you said that because you had blonde hair and white skin, you wouldn't be going to jail."" In an interview with Insider, she said she now believes the tweet was ""very dumb"" but added that it was ""taken out of context."" She said she had sent the tweet to her ""haters"" after reports emerged that she had taken a private jet to Washington, DC, to attend the pro-Trump rally that preceded the riot. ""I've received thousands of emails, texts, tweets of people calling me a racist, entitled, insurrection Barbie ... And I was just told that they were going to recommend probation,"" she said. ""And I was like, 'You all, no, I'm not going to prison. I'm sorry I have blond hair. I'm sorry.'"" ""You can't hear inflection on a tweet,"" she said. ""I was like, 'You all, I'm sorry. I have a good job. I'm sorry I'm happy. I'm sorry, you haters.'"" ""Since this happened to me, I have a new level of respect for all levels of celebrity, high profile, or even just the ordinary person. Now before I tweet, or before I talk ... I stop and I go, 'Wait a minute, this could be totally off,'"" she said. She added that she was ""not going to regret being myself"" and standing up for herself. ""But now it's changing my whole vernacular because I don't want to be a target,"" she said, adding, ""I can't say 'Nazi' or 'rape' because my freedom of speech has been taken away from me."" She did not specify what she would be a target of, and she gave no reason for singling out the words ""Nazi"" and ""rape."" Since being charged in the insurrection, she has said that she regrets entering Capitol grounds on January 6 but that she did not regret attending the rally. Ryan is due to start her sentence next month. In a TikTok video posted earlier this month, Ryan said she wanted to practice yoga, detox from alcohol, and lose 30 pounds in prison. She also told Insider she was preparing for her time behind bars by learning prison slang and speaking to prison consultants.
