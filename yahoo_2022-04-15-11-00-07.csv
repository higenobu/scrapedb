4/15/2022,"By SungHyuk An, Yeni Seo and Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - For people in many countries, living in a penthouse is the dream. In North Korea? Not so much. Leader Kim Jong Un keeps building outwardly glamorous high-rise apartment buildings in the capital, Pyongyang, with the latest being an 80-storey skyscraper completed this week. But defectors and other North Koreans say that unreliable elevators and electricity, poor water supply, and concerns about workmanship mean that historically few people have wanted to live near the top of such structures. ""In North Korea, the poor live in penthouses rather than the rich, because lifts are often not working properly, and they cannot pump up water due to the low pressure,"" said Jung Si-woo, a 31-year-old who defected to neighbouring South Korea in 2017. In the North, he lived on the third floor of a 13-storey building that lacked an elevator, while a friend who lived on the 28th floor of a 40-storey block had never used the elevator because it was not working, Jung said. Asked about the new 80-floor skyscraper opened this week, Jung said he thought Kim was just showing off. ""It's to show how much their construction skills have improved, rather than considering residents' preferences,"" said the university student. North Korea assigns housing, with buying and selling of homes or apartments technically illegal in the socialist state. But experts say the practice has become common, dabbled in mostly by those who benefited from the spread of private markets under Kim. He has vowed to improve construction quality and build tens of thousands of new apartments. Its economy has been hammered by self-imposed border closures against COVID-19, natural disasters, and international sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, which the United States says draw limited resources away from meeting people's needs. On Wednesday, state media said the first 10,000 new apartments had been completed in Pyongyang, from a target of 50,000, and touted the speed of their completion, including the 80-floor skyscraper. Workers ""guaranteed the quality of construction"" and the new apartments and other buildings meant for use in education, public health and welfare services would further help make the capital a ""people first"" city, state news agency KCNA said. On Thursday state media showed Kim inaugurating another housing cluster, this time for members of the elite, including a famous TV anchor. They were low-rise buildings, each only a few floors tall. PROGRESS TO BE MADE The power supply improved significantly under Kim, spawning some new night life opportunities, but North Korea still grapples with shortages and sometimes shoddy infrastructure. Many have turned to individual solar panels for the spells without power. That has brought a rash of small items of consumer electronics, but cannot power amenities such as elevators and water supply. Lee Sang-yong, the editor in chief of Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, said his sources reported that the apartments for regular people were not ready to live in. Windows had only frames and water taps, though installed, were not working, but the recently completed luxury homes come complete with furniture and utensils. To ensure the new highrise apartments are popular, North Korea will have to further improve electricity and water supplies, and overcome worries about the quality of construction, he added. Jung said when he lived in Pyongyang, most elevators worked just twice a day, during peak commuting hours from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the same timing in the evening. Low water pressure often forced those living on higher floors to carry water upstairs from the ground level, or install their own special pump machines, he added. During the last major international media tour arranged by the government, in 2018, the elevators operated at the 47-floor Yanggakdo International Hotel, but there was no electricity on dozens of floors where North Korean staff stayed. At the time, two North Korean officials acknowledged to Reuters that the upper levels of the highrises in one of Kim's recently opened pet construction projects, on Mirae Scientists Street, had few takers, because of the worries over elevators. ""No one wants to risk having to climb for an hour,"" one said.

4/15/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine — The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a guided-missile cruiser that became a potent target of Ukrainian defiance in the opening days of the war, sank Thursday after it was heavily damaged in the latest setback for Moscow’s invasion. Ukrainian officials said their forces hit the vessel with missiles, while Russia acknowledged a fire aboard the Moskva but no attack. U.S. and other Western officials could not confirm what caused the blaze. The loss of the warship named for the Russian capital is a devastating symbolic defeat for Moscow as its troops regroup for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine after retreating from much of the north, including the capital. The Russian Defense Ministry said the ship sank in a storm while being towed to a port. Russia earlier said the flames on the ship, which would typically have 500 sailors on board, forced the entire crew to evacuate. It later said the blaze had been contained and that the ship would be towed to port with its missile launchers intact. The ship can carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, and its removal from combat reduces Russia’s firepower in the Black Sea. It’s also a blow to Russian prestige in a war already widely seen as a historic blunder. Now entering its eighth week, Russia’s invasion has stalled because of resistance from Ukrainian fighters bolstered by weapons and other aid sent by Western nations. US unveils $800 million in weapons and equipment, plus training, for Ukraine The news of the flagship’s damage overshadowed Russian claims of advances in the southern port city of Mariupol, where they have been battling the Ukrainians since the early days of the invasion in some of the heaviest fighting of the war — at a horrific cost to civilians. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Wednesday that 1,026 Ukrainian troops surrendered at a metals factory in the city. But Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, rejected the claim, telling Current Time TV that “the battle over the seaport is still ongoing today.” It was unclear how many forces were still defending Mariupol. Russian state television broadcast footage that it said was from Mariupol showing dozens of men in camouflage walking with their hands up and carrying others on stretchers. One man held a white flag. Mariupol’s capture is critical for Russia because it would allow its forces in the south, which came up through the annexed Crimean Peninsula, to fully link up with troops in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland and the target of the coming offensive. The Russian military continues to move helicopters and other equipment together for such a effort, according to a senior U.S. defense official, and it will likely add more ground combat units “over coming days.” But it’s still unclear when Russia could launch a bigger offensive in the Donbas. Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukraine in the Donbas since 2014, the same year Russia seized Crimea. Russia has recognized the independence of the rebel regions in the Donbas. The loss of the Moskva could delay any new, wide-ranging offensive. Maksym Marchenko, the governor of the Odesa region, across the Black Sea to the northwest of Sevastopol, said the Ukrainians struck the ship with two Neptune missiles and caused “serious damage.” Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, called it an event of “colossal significance.” Russia’s Defense Ministry said ammunition on board detonated as a result of a fire, without saying what caused the blaze. It said the “main missile weapons” were not damaged. In addition to the cruise missiles, the warship also had air-defense missiles and other guns. The Neptune is an anti-ship missile that was recently developed by Ukraine and based on an earlier Soviet design. The launchers are mounted on trucks stationed near the coast, and, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, the missiles can hit targets up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) away. That would have put the Moskva within range, based on where the fire began. The U.S. was not able to confirm Ukraine’s claims of striking the warship, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday. Still, he called it “a big blow to Russia.” “They’ve had to kind of choose between two stories: One story is that it was just incompetence, and the other was that they came under attack, and neither is a particular the good outcome for them,” Sullivan told the Economic Club of Washington. During the first days of the war, The Moskva was reportedly the warship that called on Ukrainian soldiers stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender in a standoff. In a widely circulated recording, the soldier responds: “Russian warship, go (expletive) yourself.” The AP could not independently verify the incident, but Ukraine and its supporters consider it an iconic moment of defiance. The country recently unveiled a postage stamp commemorating it. Russia invaded on Feb. 24 and has lost potentially thousands of fighters. The conflict has killed untold numbers of Ukrainian civilians and forced millions more to flee. It’s also further inflated prices at grocery stores and gasoline pumps because Ukraine and Russia are major producers of crops and energy, while dragging on the global economy. The head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the war helped push the organization to downgrade economic forecasts for 143 countries. Also Thursday, Russian authorities accused Ukraine of sending two low-flying military helicopters across the border and firing on residential buildings in the village of Klimovo in Russia’s Bryansk region, some 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the frontier. Russia’s Investigative Committee said seven people, including a toddler, were wounded. Russia’s state security service had earlier said Ukrainian forces fired mortar rounds at a border post in Bryansk as refugees were crossing, forcing them to flee. The reports could not be independently verified. Earlier this month, Ukrainian security officials denied that Kyiv was behind an air strike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, some 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the border.

4/15/2022,"A Chilean man has appealed his 28-year prison sentence over the murder of his Japanese ex-girlfriend in France in 2016.

Nicolas Zepeda, 31, lodged the appealon Wednesday, a day after a local French court gave him his sentence and determined that the murder was premeditated, as prosecutors had previously claimed.

 Zepeda moved to Japan to study at the University of Tsukuba in 2014 and started dating Kurosaki, according to reports. In September 2016, Kurosaki moved to Besançon, France, at the age of 21to study language as an exchange student at the University of Franche-Comte.

The couple reportedly broke up in the fall of that year but met again while having dinner with acquaintances on Dec. 4, 2016. The two went to Kurosaki’s dormitory after their meal, and some students claimed to have heard a scream from her room later that night. She has been missing ever since.

Zepeda went back to Chile shortly after Kurosaki’s disappearance. He was handed over to French authorities in July 2020 with the help of Chilean authorities.

French prosecutors formally charged Zepeda with murder, claiming that he committed the crime over a quarrel. The court has not disclosed the reasoning behind the ruling, according to reports.

Zepeda's trial began in March. French prosecutors reportedly argued for lifetime imprisonment, but Zepeda was only given a 28-year prison sentence.

French authorities launched a search for Kurosaki’s body after her disappearance, but police have yet to find her remains.

4/15/2022,"(Reuters) -Russian officials on Thursday said Ukrainian helicopters had hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the Bryansk region, the latest of a series of cross-border attacks that Moscow has said may trigger a retaliatory attack on Kyiv. The governor of the Belgorod region said villages there were also attacked and one person had been injured. Ukraine's defence ministry, which has declined to comment on several border incidents including a strike on a fuel depot in the city of Belgorod earlier this month, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The Ukrainian government's Center for Countering Disinformation accused Russia's intelligence services of implementing ""a plan to carry out terrorist acts to whip up anti-Ukrainian hysteria"" in Russia, according to a statement. It mentioned two purported attacks in the western Russian city of Bryansk but nothing about an air strike. ""On April 14, 2022, using two combat helicopters equipped with heavy offensive weapons, military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine illegally entered the airspace of the Russian Federation,"" Russia's investigative committee said in a statement. ""Moving at low altitude, they carried out at least six air strikes on residential buildings in the village of Klimovo,"" it said. Six buildings were damaged and seven people were injured, the statement said. A health ministry official said two people had been seriously injured, RIA news agency reported. Bryansk regional authorities closed schools for fear of further strikes, TASS news agency reported. Vehicles were damaged when a border post came under mortar fire from Ukraine near Klimovo on Wednesday, Russia's FSB security service told state television. Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday the continuation of ""sabotage and attacks"" by Ukrainian forces could prompt attacks on the capital Kyiv. ""If such incidents continue, then consequence from the armed forces of the Russian Federation will be attacks on decision making centres, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army has refrained from to date,"" the defence ministry said. Authorities in four Russian regions bordering Ukraine and in Russian-controlled Crimea announced they were increasing security measures on Monday over what they said were ""possible provocations"" from Ukraine. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and left Russia increasingly isolated on the world stage. The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" in late February to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for an unprovoked attack.

4/15/2022,"Bill Maher continues to insist that his politics haven’t changed — but the landscape is shifting beneath his feet so fast that the prolific GOP-bashing host of HBO’s “Real Time” suggested on Joe Rogan’s podcast this week that even he may have a tipping point to cross over to the Republican Party. Maher, the staunch liberal who ushered politics into late night with “Politically Incorrect” and now “Real Time” on HBO, has had taken many sojourns into centrist and center-right thinking of late. He and Rogan likened their mutual centrism to a rare form of “common sense” on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast that debuted Tuesday. Maher suggested that runaway government spending — and the grift that comes along with it — just might be the thing that changes his stripes. Rogan and Maher began by riffing on the enormous spending packages the federal government has floated of late, including the Democrats’ doomed “Build Back Better” package and the Trump-era COVID-19 stimulus packages, and how much of that money winds up in the hands of fraudsters and grifters. “People would say to me, ‘Oh, you’re complaining [like a Republican] about the government spending money,” Maher said. “OK, but is there any number at which I am not tipped over to the Republican side? That I can’t complain about money that’s just being stolen?” Like everyone, Maher apparently has a price. (Watch the video clip below). Maher went on to make the connection to California’s now-defunct Pacific Coast railroad line, which absorbed hundreds of millions of federal and state dollars only to break down and fade to oblivion. “As a good liberal, I totally accept the notion that ‘You cannot transfer money without a leaky bucket,'” Maher continued. “I get it. It can’t be perfect. But is there no number for which I cannot remonstrate against this?” “California tried to build a railroad,” Maher said. “Makes sense, cars, good for the environment, blah blah blah. When they finally pulled the plug, it was $200 million a mile. Now France, not unknown to have unions and workers’ rights, did it for like, one-seventh [of the cost].” Maher also acknowledged that had Build Back Better passed, it, too, would have been ripe for the picking. “When I hear about ‘Build Back Better,’ certainly the country needs to be rebuilt,” Maher said. “The infrastructure is a mess. But I’m always thinking like, when you give me a number [in this case, $1.5 trillion], it seems like you pulled it out of your ass. And it came in right at that round number, huh? … what if we only spend $1.2 trillion? What would we be saving? Because so much money is going to consultants — all the pigs at the trough.” Maher said that kind of thinking is not a Republican idea, it’s more like … “Common sense?” Rogan replied. “Common sense!” exclaimed Maher. “Yes!”",U.S./The Wrap,Bill Maher Reveals the One Thing That Might ‘Tip Me Over to the Republican Side’,https://news.yahoo.com/bill-maher-reveals-one-thing-152450182.html
4/15/2022,"STORY: Russia's lead warship in the Black Sea - seen here in a satellite image from April 7th - sank on Thursday, according to Russia's defense ministry, in a fresh blow to Moscow's military campaign as it prepared for new assaults in east and south Ukraine. Russia said ammunition on board the ship had exploded, causing a fire, but Ukraine said it struck the Moskva with a missile. Satellite images taken earlier this month showed the Moskva Russian missile cruiser in the port of Sevastopol before it was damaged. The loss of the Moskva, the flagship in Russia's Black Sea fleet, happened as it was being towed to port in stormy weather - Russian news agencies reported. Earlier Thursday, a spokesman for Ukraine's military said it was hit by a Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship missile. “The flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet sustained substantial damages. A fire started. Other ships tried to provide assistance, but a storm and powerful explosion of ammunition turned the ship over and it started sinking.” Russia's defense ministry said more than 500 crew aboard the Soviet-era missile cruiser were evacuated. Russia did not acknowledge an attack and said the incident was under investigation. Reuters was unable to verify what happened to the ship or whether it had sunk. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. could not yet determine whether the ship had been hit by a missile, or what impact the loss might have to Russia's assault. ""It's going to have an impact on their capabilities, certainly in the near term. Whether it has an impact on their naval capabilities in the long term is just, we're just unclear right now."" The incident came as Russia's navy continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities on the Black Sea nearly two months after it launched the invasion. Russian forces have pulled back after suffering heavy losses and failing to take the capital Kyiv, as it focuses new attacks on the south and eastern regions of Ukraine.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Russia says warship sank, Ukraine claims credit",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-says-warship-sank-ukraine-233047262.html
