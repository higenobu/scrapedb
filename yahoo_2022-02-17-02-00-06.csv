2/17/2022,"Model Linda Evangelista is speaking out and sharing new photos of herself after revealing she was left ""brutally disfigured"" by a cosmetic procedure gone wrong. Last year, Evangelista said she underwent Zeltiq's CoolSculpting procedure to decrease fat cells. But she alleged it ""did the opposite of what it promised"" and ""left me permanently deformed,"" leading her to become a ""recluse."" She's now speaking out in her first interview on the subject with People magazine. ""I loved being up on the catwalk,"" she told People. ""Now I dread running into someone I know. I can't live like this anymore, in hiding and shame. I just couldn't live in this pain any longer. I'm willing to finally speak."" Evangelista said she began noticing bulges on her body after the procedure and that a doctor diagnosed her with paradoxical adipose hyperplasia. While she says she ""tried to fix it myself,"" she says the doctor told her ""no amount of dieting, and no amount of exercise was ever going to fix it,"" and after undergoing two liposuction surgeries, ""It wasn't even a little bit better."" ""I don't recognize myself physically, but I don't recognize me as a person any longer either,"" Evangelista added. She has filed a lawsuit against the parent company of CoolSculpting, Zeltiq Aesthetics, seeking $50 million in damages. A representative for CoolSculpting told People its procedure, which has been cleared by the FDA, ""has been well studied with more than 100 scientific publications and more than 11 million treatments performed worldwide."" Evangelista previously said that with her lawsuit, she is ""moving forward to rid myself of my shame,"" and she told People her goal is to ""shed myself of some of the shame and help other people who are in the same situation as me.""

2/17/2022,"Trump's longtime accountants distanced themselves from his businesses in newly-published documents. The news had had ripples in the Republican Party, helping galvanize his critics. Sen. Mitt Romney, a Trump foe in the GOP, said the development was problematic. Some Republicans expressed unease after former President Donald Trump's accountancy firm severed ties with him and said that 10 years of his financial statements could not be relied on. The statement from Mazars adds to the tangle of controversies surrounding Trump's business empire as he teases a potential new campaign for the presidency in 2024. In a letter released as part of New York Attorney General Letitia James' probe into the Trump Organization, Mazars said the statements it helped compile on Trump's finances ""should not be relied upon."" In recent days, reports have claimed that some Republican leaders are questioning Trump's pre-eminence in the party. The GOP figures named are all those who have been willing to criticize Trump in the past. They are said to believe that controversy surrounding his business dealings and his fixation on bogus election fraud claims could damage them in the mid-terms. The New York Times reported Saturday that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was quietly backing candidates who would resist Trump's influence. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a high-profile critic of the former president, told The Hill Tuesday that the statement by Mazars was ""very unusual."" ""I've never seen that happen to an ongoing entity. They did also in their statement say that they didn't see anything of a substantial nature ... that suggested there had been misreporting, but it will obviously create a great deal of anxiety inside the organization and an effort to find what that problem was,"" he said. Another senior Republican, who spoke to the publication on condition of anonymity, said that the investigations could ""obviously"" impact Trump's decision to run, or his viability as a candidate. In more outspoken style, longtime Republican Trump critic George Conway in a CNN interview said the development was ""calamitous"" and ""worse than being impeached twice."" The statement raises ""all sorts of potential collateral issues for the Trump Organization,"" Conway claimed. Trump faces a parallel criminal inquiry into allegations of tax fraud by the Manhattan district attorney, who charged the Trump Organization CFO, Allen Weisselberg, with tax offenses last year. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and remains favorite to clinch the GOP president ual nomination should he run for the presidency again in 2024. The Trump Organization said Monday that it was ""disappointed that Mazars has chosen to part ways,"" with it. The company alleged that Mazar's statement that it had not while claiming the fact the firm claimed it had not identified ""material discrepancies"" from the firm invalidates the premise of James's investigations.

2/17/2022,"By Gustavo Palencia and Marvin Valladares TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) -Scores of Honduran police officers on Monday surrounded the house of former president Juan Orlando Hernandez after the United States asked the government to arrest and extradite Washington's key erstwhile ally in the region. Speculation has been swirling for months that the United States was planning to extradite Hernandez when he left office amid accusations that he colluded with drug traffickers. Leftist leader Xiomara Castro replaced him as president last month. Washington's request for extradition represents a major about-face by the U.S. government, which saw Hernandez as a vital ally in the volatile Central America region during his eight years in power. The United States had already placed Hernandez on a blacklist, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this month said there were credible reports Hernandez ""has engaged in significant corruption by committing or facilitating acts of corruption and narco-trafficking"". Hernandez could not be immediately reached for comment but he has always denied any links to drug traffickers. A Reuters witness outside Hernandez's house said about 100 police officers were waiting outside. Hernandez's lawyer, Hermes Ramírez, told Canal 5 television that the former president was holed up inside his home and that the arrest warrant for Hernandez is illegal because he has immunity as a member of the regional Central American parliament. ""They are trying to trample on the rights of President Hernandez,"" Ramirez said. Hernandez formally joined the Guatemala-based regional body, called Parlacen, just a few hours after Castro's inauguration as president. Parlacen affords members immunity from prosecution in Central America, though that immunity can be removed or suspended if a member's home country requests it. Luis Javier Santos, Honduras' best known anti-corruption prosecutor, said on Twitter that ""there is no impediment to his extradition"". The Honduran Foreign Ministry earlier in the day said the U.S. Embassy had requested the arrest of a Honduran politician who is the subject of an extradition request to the United States, without naming him. A senior Honduran official, speaking anonymously because they were not allowed to speak to media on the subject, told Reuters the United States ""requested the provisional arrest of former president Juan Orlando Hernández for extradition purposes"". Melvin Duarte, a spokesman for the Honduran judiciary, said the Supreme Court is due to meet at 9.30am on Tuesday to name a judge to oversee Hernandez' extradition case. Throughout his time in power Hernandez, cultivated close ties to Washington and most notably won the support of former U.S. President Donald Trump, using Honduran security forces to help the Republican leader cut down on U.S.-bound land migration routes from Central America and further afield. But allegations of links with drug traffickers dogged his time in power, which was also marred by corruption scandals. Last year, a U.S. judge sentenced Hernandez's brother to life in prison plus 30 years for drug trafficking.
