3/25/2022,"Elizaveta Peskova/Instagram The 24-year-old daughter of Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary said in a recent interview that sanctions imposed on her are ""totally unfair and unfounded."" But the U.S. calls her father is a ""top purveyor"" of Russian propaganda who lies to justify the country's invasion of Ukraine — while she profits from a Kremlin connection and lives a life of jet-setting luxury. Elizaveta Dmitriyevna Peskova struts across red carpets in gorgeous gowns, flips her hair, poses to Kylie Minogue tunes and snuggles with her dad, Dmitry Peskov, in various posts on Instagram, where she has more than 250,000 followers. ""I completely understand that I have more opportunities than others because of course I don't come from just a simple family,"" Peskova told Insider in an interview from Moscow, published Friday. ""But, you know, without a brain you cannot transform these possibilities into something."" Peskova is the founder of a communications firm, director of a historical foundation and studied international relations, according to Insider. Her father has been Putin's spokesman for more than two decades and contributes, according to the U.S. State Department, to ""Russia's global disinformation and destabilizing influence campaign, including in Ukraine."" A week after the U.S. announced its sanctions against Peskov on March 3, his wife, Tatiana Aleksandrovna Navka, son Nikolay Peskov and daughter were also targeted.

""I was really surprised because it's weird introducing sanctions [on] someone who is 24 years old and has nothing to do with the situation."" Though she didn't want to talk about politics in the interview, Peskova did post an anti-war message on Instagram on Feb. 25, before deleting it, Insider reported. ""When I say it, I mean that I am for peace, not only in Ukraine but all around the world,"" Peskova told the site last week, adding that she won't discuss ""the situation going on."" ""I can only speak about the sanctions and I can only say what I feel and what I think about the sanctions,"" she said. RELATED: U.S. Believes 'Russia's Forces Have Committed War Crimes in Ukraine' Russia has banned Instagram and made it illegal to protest the country's war in Ukraine under laws that prohibit ""public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"" and carry a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Elizaveta Peskova/Instagram  Though she has a ""very deep connection with my father"" and recalled visiting Times Square on a trip to New York City with her him when she was 9, Peskova said she believes she shouldn't be punished for his job and Russia's war on Ukraine, according to Insider, where hundreds of civilians have died and millions have been made refugees. ""I would like to travel, and I love different cultures,"" Peskova said, adding, ""I am a citizen of the world, and I can't do anything about it.""

Elizaveta Peskova/Instagram  ""It's a very big delusion,"" Peskova said. ""Western countries just do not understand how the Russian system works."" As the war continues, Peskova acknowledged that refusing to speak about it — amid daily images and reports of devastation in Ukraine — might make it hard for people to feel any sympathy for a young woman Insider describes as a ""socialite"" with close connections to Putin. ""I don't want my words twisted and I don't trust anyone,"" Peskova said. ""I just don't want to talk about it now. Like maybe in a week or in two weeks. Because I'm also shocked. I'm also very upset. And I'm also, like, maybe it's not the right time to talk about it?""",World/People,Her Dad Is Putin's Press Chief and She Says Sanctions Against Her Are 'Totally Unfair and Unfounded',https://news.yahoo.com/her-dad-putins-press-chief-190641135.html
3/25/2022,"A Twitter account claiming to be connected with the activist collective Anonymous announced this week that it hacked Russia’s central bank, and it is planning to release 35,000 documents over the next 48 hours detailing “secret agreements.” The Central Bank of the Russian Federation did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. The international collective of hackers declared cyber war on Russian President Vladimir Putin in a video shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago. “Soon you will feel the wrath of the world’s hackers,” Anonymous declared in a video on Twitter in late February. So far, the group says it has made good on its threat. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, hackers linked to Anonymous said they hacked Russian state TV channels and briefly interrupted programming to show a video of Ukrainian buildings being bombed. Rostelecom, the Russian company that runs the allegedly hacked TV channels, did not respond to BBC’s requests for comment. The Russian government has tight control over the media in the country, and earlier this month Putin signed a law that criminalizes reporting that goes against the official government stance on the war in Ukraine. While Western countries have escalated sanctions to cut Russia off from international trade and the international banking system, Anonymous has taken less conventional action against the country. The group has threatened any companies that have not ceased operations in Russia following the invasion, tweeting at the companies, “Your time is running out. We do not forgive. We do not forget.” Earlier this month, members linked to the group also offered Russian troops $52,000 in Bitcoin if they abandoned their tanks on the battlefield. As the war in Ukraine continues to drag on, the battle is increasingly being waged online. A group of Polish hackers calling themselves Squad 303 (named after a World War II Polish fighter squadron) built a website that enabled people to send text messages to random Russian phone numbers to tell them what was happening in Ukraine. The group claims more than 20 million SMS and WhatsApp messages have been sent through the service, according to the BBC. The government of Ukraine is also reportedly expanding its online efforts, according to a tweet by Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister, to protect Ukraine’s online infrastructure and launch counterattacks. “We are creating an IT army. We need digital talents,” Fedorov said.

3/25/2022,"The zeitgeist of Google is angry about compensation. Or should that be the “Googlegeist?” That’s the name of an annual survey, and Google released the results of the latest edition earlier this month. Though it found that an overwhelming majority of employees are satisfied with the company’s mission and values, as of January, just a little over half said they believed their compensation packages are competitive, a number down from last year. As you might expect, compensation was a key topic of discussion at a recent all-hands meeting with company executives, CNBC reports. Via Dory, an internal Google tool the company uses to facilitate dialogue between speakers and attendees during events, employees subjected senior leaders at the search engine giant to a slew of tough questions over pay. Executives including CEO Sundhar Pichai and VP of total rewards (compensation and stock packages) Brett Hill were front and center. “Compensation-related questions showed the biggest decrease from last year, what is your understanding of why that is?” asked one employee. Hill replied: “It’s a very competitive market and you’re probably hearing anecdotal stories of colleagues getting better offers at other companies.” He also noted that employees are likely feeling the effects of inflation or the impact of location changes on their salaries. (Last summer, the company announced that it would alter salaries to reflect local markets for employees who moved or opted to work from home permanently.) “Amazon adjusted base salary cap, Apple reportedly used RSU bonuses,” wrote another employee, who then asked how Google is planning to respond to its corporate peers in terms of compensation in a tight labor market. Hill noted that when considering the 81 companies Google typically competes with for talent, there’s been no trouble with recruitment. “We already compare favorably to these companies. We are able to hire from them,” he said. “We will make changes if and when we need to.” When pushed by another employee about the drop in employee compensation satisfaction, Hill said: “This trend — it is concerning to us and we are keeping a close eye on it.” “We know that our employees have many choices about where they work, so we ensure they are very well compensated,"" said a Google spokesperson in a statement provided to Fortune. ""That’s why we've always provided top of market compensation across salary, equity, leave, and a suite of benefits. Getting employee feedback is important, and we'll continue to ensure we pay competitively everywhere our employees work and help them grow their careers at Google.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune,"Google execs cornered by employees at all-hands, demanding to know why Amazon and Apple are paying more",https://news.yahoo.com/google-execs-cornered-employees-hands-205046684.html
