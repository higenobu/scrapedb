2/26/2022,"No one knows how Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine will play out (or as people say ""what his endgame is"") but one thing’s for sure — predicting his next move and any subsequent impact on the global economy is a fool’s errand. Before I get into that though, and forgive me for being obvious, but aren’t we all sickened by the suffering Putin is bringing to Ukraine? Who knows how many will be uprooted or separated from their parents — never mind wounded or die? And for what? That one person can foist so much horror on the world is frankly depressing. (Note to Xi Jinping: This is your new best friend we’re talking about.) Returning to the economic state of play, there are at least two levels of ambiguity here. First is what exactly Putin is up to? Second is that markets respond differently to each political crisis or war. Between those two fogs — one of Putin and the other of war — we’re left with little firm ground. Having said that, we can cut through this enough to provide some clarity. I am no Kremlinologist, armchair or otherwise, but I’ve seen enough of Vlad and his authoritarian ilk to have a feel for his M.O. Putin claims to feel aggrieved regarding Russia’s diminished presence in the world. Madeleine Albright, who went head to head with him as Secretary of State, said as much this week: “Putin is embarrassed by what happened to his country and determined to restore its greatness.” But then she went on to say, and I agree, that mostly he is simply trying to strengthen his hand at home and weaken his rivals abroad. In other words, it’s about maintaining and enhancing his power. It’s straight out of the dictator’s playbook a la bread and circuses, only this is no Roman metonymy. Putin is bombarding his country and the rest of us with the most sophisticated digital lies, disinformation, trolling and hacks the world has ever seen. It’s ""Wag the Dog"" in the age of metaverse. Here’s Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments, speaking to Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman: “Is there an end game in which he could declare victory? I would say no, he does not have much of an end game. In fact, I would go even a little bit further, Julie. I would say that he's already lost to the extent that he has now become a pariah in all of Europe. I think that pariah label is going to stick with him for quite some time. I don't know what the offramp is, but what I worry about more than anything else is lots of casualties in the next week or so.” Putin has to be careful what he wishes for. Take over Ukraine, sure, but then he has to hold it. That will cost Russia a fortune if not in rubles, in human lives. (See Brezhnev and Afghanistan.) It raises questions about Putin’s mental state, which the ever-erudite Peggy Noonan speaks to in this excellent column. Unsettling to say the least. Still The Wall Street Journal notes Russia has a stronger hand than it did in the 1950s Cold War. Besides supplying Europe with much of its energy, (40% in the case of Italy), China is a vastly more formidable ally and a much bigger trading partner today than 70 years ago. Here too though Putin is testing the limits. Yesterday in a call between Xi and Putin, the Chinese leader urged his Russian counterpart to negotiate with Ukraine, saying “‘cold war mindsets’ should be abandoned,” according to the South China Morning Post. Who knows how much of this is just for show? In Beijing, the Chinese media are mostly feeding the populace a steady diet of ""Ukraine-situation-is-America’s-fault"" news. As for the sanctions we have and will impose on Russia and Putin, they carry an unprecedented risk of cyber retaliation. To the extent Putin’s madness has any sort of method, and if a tertiary goal is to weaken the U.S. and the West, he’s succeeding — some. The S&P 500 is only down 2.6% since the beginning of the crisis on Feb. 10, but the uncertainty and volatility have been gut-wrenching. The price of oil (WTI) is now $91.59 up 2.2% from Feb. 10. (Russia supplies 10% of the world’s oil and gas.) Also, wheat is up 11.4%. As Yahoo Finance’s Rick Newman writes, all this will worsen inflation and complicate the Federal Reserve’s rate hiking agenda this spring. It’s worth noting though, the two countries hurt most here are Ukraine and Russia. The Russian stock market has plunged, falling 32% since Feb. 10. Two of Russia’s highest profile stocks, Gazprom which runs the Nord Stream 2 pipeline into Europe and search engine Yandex, are down 40% and 63%, respectively. The ruble has sunk to a record low versus the dollar. Will economic conditions deteriorate further because of Ukraine and Putin? Who knows. Maybe next week Xi Jinping will be up for a Nobel Peace Prize. As terrible as this is for Ukraine, Europe and civilization it may not have much of a lasting impact. In many cases even the biggest geopolitical crises don’t have much staying power when it comes to the markets. (Of course if we get a wholesale European conflict or heaven forbid a nuclear event, all bets are off.) As you can see from this chart below markets tend to be higher 12 months after a big bad event, unless there is a recession. Which makes sense since, as they say, stocks usually go up, especially over time. Which to me suggests an encouraging point here. Over time we recover and move on. Meaning at some point, Putin will fail. Sadly there will be much pain and suffering before then. But in the end Putin won't win. — This article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on February 26, 2022.

2/26/2022,"The movements of merchant and cargo ships are being scrutinized amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. BBC News reported Saturday that France stopped a cargo ship en route to Russia's St Petersburg. On Friday, a tanker crew had to abandon ship after reportedly being hit by a Russian missile. The movements and activities of merchant and cargo ships are under renewed scrutiny as the Ukraine invasion continues. BBC News reported Saturday that the French Navy had intercepted a cargo ship in the English Channel that was bound for St Petersburg, Russia. French border forces are inspecting the cargo to establish whether it belongs to a company targeted by EU sanctions against Moscow, the outlet reported. Meanwhile, merchant ships are increasingly becoming the target of Russian missiles, The Maritime Executive reported. In one incident on Friday, the crew of a small chemical tanker was forced to abandon ship with two seriously injured, the outlet reported. It cited a tweet from Ukraine's OSINT Academy. The secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Kitack Lim, is urging ""all parties to take steps to ensure"" safe passage across the seas. Lim told Insider he supports and stands with UN secretary-general António Guterres' call for hostilities to cease immediately. He added: ""I am gravely concerned about the spillover effects of the military action in Ukraine on global shipping, and logistics and supply chains."" ""Along with the people of Ukraine, innocent ships, seafarers and port workers engaged in legitimate trade should not be adversely impacted by this growing crisis. Shipping, particularly seafarers, cannot be collateral victims in a larger political and military crisis — they must be safe and secure,"" Lim said. Russia was seen sailing into the Black Sea earlier in February, bringing military power closer to Ukraine, Insider reported. Russia's Ministry of Defense had said the ships were moving into the area to ""work out the actions of the Navy and Aerospace Forces to protect Russian national interests in the world ocean."" In a statement issued on the IMO's website, on Friday, Lim said: ""The security situation in Ukraine is impacting trade by sea. The safety of marine personnel including seafarers is vital. Shipping is essential to global trade — as has been proven during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. He added: ""I urge all parties to take steps to ensure the protection of seafarers, vessels, and cargo."" According to The Wall Street Journal on Friday, the most serious incident since Russia invaded Ukraine was reported by Moldova's national naval agency. A missile hit a commercial oil tanker in the Black Sea, destroying the ship's lifeboats and forcing the crew to jump overboard. Reuters reported that insurers have raised their rates for vessels operating in the Black Sea, which would mean additional costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars for a ship voyage, the agency said. Lim issued a statement on Thursday, following Russia's entry into Ukraine. ""The use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold. This applies to the present military offensive,"" it said. He added: ""It is wrong. It is against the Charter. It is unacceptable. But it is not irreversible. I repeat my appeal from last night to President Putin: Stop the military operation. Bring the troops back to Russia. We know the toll of war.""

2/26/2022,"Russia's space chief claimed new US sanctions could have severe consequences for the ISS. In a tweet, its director-general appeared to suggest the ISS could crash into the US or Europe. The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them?"" he said. The chief of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has claimed that new US sanctions could have dire consequences for the future of the International Space Station (ISS). In a tweet Thursday, director general Dmitry Rogozin warned that the sanctions could ""destroy our cooperation on the ISS."" President Joe Biden recently announced a set of US-imposed penalties on Russia following its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions target Russia's economy, military, financial system, and technological imports. On Thursday, Biden said he was authorizing ""additional strong sanctions"" against Russia and ""new limitations"" on what could be exported to the country. ""We have purposely designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and minimize the impact on the United States and our allies,"" Biden said. According to CNN, Biden further stated that the sanctions ""will degrade (Russia's) aerospace industry, including their space program."" In response, Rogozin said on Twitter: ""If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe?"" He added: There is also the option of dropping a 500-ton structure to India and China. Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them?"" Rogozin also mentioned that the ISS's location and orbit in space are controlled by ""Russian Progress MS cargo ships."" NASA did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours. In a statement to Euronews, however, NASA said that it ""continues working with Roscosmos and our other international partners in Canada, Europe, and Japan to maintain safe and continuous ISS operations."" It added: ""The new export control measures will continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation."" There are four NASA astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts, and one European astronaut aboard the ISS.

2/26/2022,"The nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson is an attempt to “defile” the supreme court and “humiliate and degrade” the US, the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson claimed on Friday night. Related: Ketanji Brown Jackson: who is Biden’s supreme court choice? If confirmed, Jackson, whose nomination was announced by Joe Biden earlier on Friday, will be the first Black woman on the court. Carlson said Jackson was nominated “because of how she looks”. He said: “Do you want to live in that country? Most people don’t, of all colors. They think you should be elevated in America based on what you do, on the choices not on how you were born, not on your DNA, because that’s Rwanda.” One columnist called his comments “the perfect distillation of white supremacy”. Biden promised to put a Black woman on the court. Chosen from a short list of three, Jackson was introduced on Friday. Biden called her a “proven consensus builder” with “a pragmatic understanding that the law must work for the American people”, and said: “For too long, our government, our courts, haven’t looked like America.” If confirmed, the former public defender will replace the retiring Stephen Breyer. The balance of the court will stay 6-3 in favour of conservatives. At the White House, Jackson paid tribute to Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to be a federal judge, for her “steadfast and courageous commitment to equal justice under law“. Carlson claimed Jackson’s appointment showed Biden was committed to undermining equality. “Now maybe she’s great,” he said, “that’s not the point. The point is she was picked because of how she looks, so what does that tell you not about the nominee but about Joe Biden? “It tells you that he is absolutely happy to defile a system built by other people over hundreds of years, this is the best system in the history of the world, and he is happy to destroy it. Doesn’t care at all.” Carlson also claimed Jackson wasn’t “much of a jurist … not simply ignorant of the law” but also “a political activist”. Pointing to a forthcoming case concerning affirmative action in college admissions, Carlson said most Americans “think you should be elevated … based on what you do … not on how you were born, not on your DNA, because that’s Rwanda.” Jennifer Rubin, a conservative Washington Post columnist, called Carlson’s comments “the perfect distillation of white supremacy”. Justices have been nominated on grounds of identity. Ronald Reagan promised to pick a woman and installed Sandra Day O’Connor. Donald Trump promised to pick a woman to replace Ruth Bader Ginsberg and installed Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative. Most observers say Jackson, who was confirmed to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit with three Republican votes, is eminently qualified. On Friday, Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, pointed out that she has almost nine years of trial court experience, more than four current justices including the chief, John Roberts, combined. Vladeck told CNN: “Only Justice [Sonia] Sotomayor among the current justices has trial court experience … and so I think what we’re really talking about here is diversity along so many axes, and from a nominee who really ticks every conceivable box.” Vladeck also said it was “really hard to figure out what the line of attack would be against someone with Jackson’s credentials, her background, her experience, you know, her resumé”. Republicans have been happy to offer previews. Ted Cruz of Texas has complained about Biden’s promise to pick a Black woman and about how Democrats treated Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second pick who denied accusations of sexual assault. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who backed a candidate from his state, said the “radical left” was behind the Jackson pick. Democrats will most likely not need Republican votes, even those (Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska) who voted to confirm Jackson last year. Democrats need only their own 50 senators and the casting vote of Kamala Harris, the vice-president. Carlson pressed on. “Let’s say you really didn’t care about the country you lead,” he said. “Let’s say you wanted to humiliate and degrade it and undermine its ancient institutions. What would you do? “Well, you might take the single most important appointed position in the entire government and announce in public that you are filling that position on the basis of appearance. Not on the basis of skill or wisdom or fealty to the founding documents of the United States, but on the basis of the way the person looks. “… That would send a very clear message that you don’t like the country you run and you don’t care about the institutions that its ancestors built.” The supreme court was founded by and has been almost exclusively populated by white men. Of 115 justices, two have been Black men and five have been women.",Politics/The Guardian,Tucker Carlson condemned for Ketanji Brown Jackson ‘Rwanda’ comments,https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-condemned-ketanji-brown-132411017.html
2/26/2022,"A container ship worker is going viral after showing just how long it takes to stop one of the massive, cargo-carrying boats. The U.K.-based seafarer, named Joe (@joethesailor), shared the shocking video on TikTok, where he frequently posts about his life as the chief officer on a container ship. His clip is just the latest in a recent trend on the app. For months, users have revealed the wildest facts about their jobs — from how much NFL water boys make a year to how workers fill ice skating rinks in the winter. Joe’s video, meanwhile, came in response to another TikToker’s question. As he explains, stopping his container ship when it’s at “full ahead” (a speed of 22.7 knots, or slightly over 26 miles per hour) takes a full 29 minutes. What’s more, the ship would cover a space of 4 miles as it stopped. Joe continues by explaining that figures like these are pre-calculated, and contained in a sheet called the “wheelhouse poster.” He also said that he could stop the ship faster if he really needed to, although it would likely damage the ship and make the engineers “scream” at him. TikTok users were stunned by the information. See this Manhattan apartment get an unbelievable maximalist makeover with just $1,000: “That actually blows my mind,” one user wrote. “29 minutes is insane.” “That is not a stop that’s slowing down,” another joked. Others used the opportunity to ask even more questions about Joe’s job. Thankfully, the TikToker has plenty of videos addressing his career — including one on how to steer a ship as large as his.
