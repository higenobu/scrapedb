3/24/2022,"It was not long after Artur posted a picture of his birth certificate showing his Ukrainian heritage to Instagram that he and his partner decided to flee Russia. “We took a precaution to leave,” said Vsevolod, his partner. Artur felt more strongly: “We read the signals,” he said, recalling the abuse he received. The couple fled Moscow for Istanbul in early March, their lives turned upside down overnight by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising concern among young men about how authorities could demand they show support for the war, including military conscription. Both of their names have been changed at their request. “The atmosphere of fear in Russia is unprecedented,” said Vsevolod. “There’s no draft right now, but there’s activity. The military networks are active. Whether this is intimidation or preparation for a draft I don’t know.” One friend signed an online petition against the war, and then the police showed up at her family home. Another friend who had already fled to Istanbul received a phone call on WhatsApp from the police, requesting to see him. Thousands of Russians have fled the country since the invasion of Ukraine, many for Turkey as well as Finland, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, where the government claims that up to 25,000 people have crossed the border in recent weeks. Istanbul has proved a popular choice, either for transit or a new home, as the closure of European airspace to Russian flights makes Turkey one of the few remaining hubs left that can serve as an escape route. “In the airport, the authorities were prying, inquiring about return tickets. I deleted Meduza and some of the other opposition news apps because there were rumours that they check people’s phones,” said Artur. Like many, he had heard stories of border guards searching travellers’ electronic devices, looking for suspicious content like support for opposition politician Alexei Navalny, or reading websites that are banned in Russia after new censorship laws. “The airport was eerie; it was so empty. But the aircraft was unusually huge, and fully packed. You could see all the young, well-dressed people with sad eyes and you understood instantly that this is the self-exiled creative class,” he said. Many of those arriving in Istanbul are millennials who grew up in a post-cold war Russia, part of a middle class that was used to international travel and working in industries deeply socially and economically intertwined with the outside world. The sudden criminalisation of the word “war” to describe Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coupled with the country’s political and economic isolation turned this reality on its head overnight. Journalists, dissidents and artists fled, worried about what would happen if they cited the war in their work. Others feared being jailed for protesting, or realised that their former lives and means of survival had simply ceased to exist. “For the first time in my life in Russia, I’m bereft of any vision of the future,” said Artur, who previously worked in the art world. The couple have no idea whether they will be living in Istanbul for three weeks, or three years. Vsevolod shared his dismay: “Things are so unpredictable right now, we can’t see the future. Anything is possible right now – mentally, we just couldn’t stay.” In a recent speech, Vladimir Putin attacked Russia’s liberals and upper class, describing them as “national traitors” with “villas in Miami or the French Riviera, who cannot make do without foie gras, oysters or gender freedom, as they call it”. The Russian president sneered at what he called their “servile mentality”, accusing them of being too western “in their minds, and not here with our people and with Russia”. Yet life in exile is quickly acquiring its own potent anti-government politics. Russian rapper Oxxxymiron organised a charity concert in Istanbul entitled Russians Against War. Tickets sold out as soon as they went on sale. “At least here or anywhere else in the world we can do more to protest than inside,” said Arsen, a former high-fashion photographer who fled the country with his partner shortly after they avoided arrest at a demonstration in Moscow. He requested that his family name be withheld to protect relatives still in Russia. Arsen felt he had no choice but to leave, and is trying to make peace with his newfound existence in Istanbul. “If we continue to participate in life in Russia things will never change, not in Russia nor here, not for people who have left. It’s important to try and set up a new life somewhere else,” he said. “We might be able to make money in Moscow, but I don’t want my children to grow up in a society like that.” The influx of Russians is already causing tensions in nearby Georgia, once part of the Soviet Union, where citizens started a petition demanding that the government end visa-free entry to Russians. “By the time I got to Istanbul, my friends in Tbilisi sent me messages telling me not to come,” said Arsen. “Already people are scared by the number of Russians who’ve moved there. They remember how the regime moves people somewhere, generations stay in a foreign country and then Putin goes there and starts a war to say he’s protecting Russians.” “We left for good,” he added. “At least until while this regime is in power nothing will change.” While political repression propelled some Russians to Istanbul, international sanctions have made properties on Turkey’s southern coastline attractive to Russian wealth. “We have no intention of joining in these sanctions,” Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told local channel Haberturk at the beginning of March. “We can’t afford to take sides,” the foreign minister added. Ukrainians and Russians have long been Turkey’s primary source of tourists. About 4.7 million Russian citizens visited Turkey last year, almost 20% of all arrivals and it has also operated a “golden visa” scheme since early 2017, where foreign nationals can acquire citizenship in just a few months after a real estate investment of $250,000 (£190,000). Aran Hawker, owner of CIP Turkey, a company that claims to be the leader in what he called “investment migration, meaning residencies and passports for ultra-high net worth individuals” said he has seen a “massive increase” in applications from Russian citizens since the invasion of Ukraine began. “As soon as the war started and sanctions started kicking in, they were quick to shut off bank accounts and credit cards,” said Hawker, describing the moment when applications for golden visas sharply rose. Property in the southern Turkish city of Antalya was already popular with Russians, Iraqis and Iranians looking to invest money abroad, while local outlets suggested that rents and sales prices were rising after an increase in Russian buyers. Turkish property sales could also face scrutiny from the US Department of Justice, who recently launched Task Force KleptoCapture intended to hunt down Russian oligarchs’ efforts to avoid sanctions or launder corrupt finances, including through property purchases. Officials from the department did not respond when contacted for comment on the issue. “We don’t want to get politically involved in anything, we just want to help people out. If someone’s even a little borderline, we don’t go near them. We’re careful about what we do,” said Hawker.",News/World news,‘We can’t see the future’: Russians fleeing war seek solace in Istanbul,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/russians-fleeing-war-seek-solace-in-istanbul
3/24/2022,"When you were working with Ingmar Bergman, were you aware that you were creating some of the greatest films in history, or did that realisation only happen with time? PaulMarnier When I met him, I had been an actor for seven years and knew he was looked on as a genius. That’s what I thought, too. So when he said he would really like to have me in a film, and wrote Persona for Bibi Andersson and me, I was aware I was to work with an incredible man. But I never knew it would mean I would be in 11 of his movies and direct some of his scripts. I had no idea it would mean a big change in my life.How did you and Bibi Andersson prepare for your roles in Persona? TheBigBadWolf If I really feel the role inside, even if it’s very different from me, I will allow it to become a part of me. I’m very happy to work with great directors because they give you the words and the circumstances and then allow you to find the person within yourself. That’s how I work. What do you think brings people back to Persona after all these years? For all the ways society and expression have expanded, this is still one of the most compelling and truthful portraits of intimacy between women I have seen on-screen (speaking as a gay woman in her 30s) rnsinsf At that time – and maybe even today – it was a new kind of movie. Bibi and I were the best of friends and so free towards each other, and the love we felt was very easy to find. I believe I was speaking in the film for Bergman. I was 25, and he was 21 years older, but I believe so much had happened in his life that he used a young woman to present what he was thinking and feeling. Perhaps a woman is not so scared of showing the truth. Then he fell in love with one of the actresses making the movie [Bergman and Ullmann were together for five years and had a daughter, Linn, who is now 55]. I think that love was part of it. He was in despair and suddenly he saw a new beginning. Not through me, but he experienced what happened between these two women – who looked as if they were quarrelling but who reached each other tremendously – as a solution. He ended his former life after that movie. I think the film does reflect how society’s perception of gender and identity has changed if we look for it. If we allow that to happen. But I think in many ways today we are closing our ears to other people’s moods and despair. But also this terrible war [in Ukraine] has woken people up. And once awakened they want to be a part of it, they want to help. They feel empathy for all the people who are suffering so much. It’s a terrible war, but good things happen in people; they understand things better. We are not alone. We are part of everything. We are not witnesses. As you are a co-founder of the Women’s Refugee Commission, will the organisation assist in the crisis in Ukraine? BobStageVoices They are very much involved, as they were with women and children in Afghanistan not so long ago. They are trying to make people in the US open their homes and take an active part in helping them. When we founded the organisation more than 30 years ago with four people, I didn’t know we would grow so big. I’ve also been part of the International Rescue Committee for 45 years. It is an incredible organisation founded by Einstein after the second world war to help Jewish people escape Germany. They thought they would only be needed for a short time. When you went to the US, how did you handle working in another language in a different culture? BobStageVoices I’m very Norwegian. I’ve had a green card for many years but I think in Norwegian and have my morals and very often react inside as a Norwegian. There are things I admire tremendously in the US but there are also things that make me happy I am Norwegian. I have to be very careful because many Norwegians have been brought up differently and not everything I say and feel is the right thing. Something I react to with horror now is that it’s so strict for Ukrainians who want to come to the US. There should be a law that people in such horror don’t have to have all their papers and agree to leave immediately. I get very shocked by that. To be honest, I know that the same thing will happen in Norway. But at least I can fight it more easily because I belong to that country. I don’t belong to the US. But I can say what I mean. You spent the first two years of your life in Tokyo so do you ever have any feelings of belonging towards Japan? Do you ever visit Japan? Haigin88 About 40 years ago I took my mother back as I said I always would once I had money. It was so different and she couldn’t find her old home, so she lost the connection. But when I was 80, three years ago, I wondered what to do for my birthday and made up my mind to go to Oshima, an island where people with leprosy were sent before the second world war. They were told they could never go home or contact their parents. It was an incredible experience. There were about 250 people left; now I think there’s 29. I said to one woman: “You have to write a book about your life here and being never allowed to leave.” She said: “I don’t need to write a book because I’m so happy with my life and everything that has happened to me.” One man, who is now dead, took me to a tree which was blooming. We danced around it as he played the harmonica. He said: “We do this to celebrate life which is beautiful and to remind ourselves life is short but it gives us hope that beautiful things will happen.” So do I belong to Japan? Yes I do! There was a reason I was born there. I learned so much from those people who never had a choice and made themselves such a fulfilling life. You’ve chosen to perform in and make quality films – and have rightly received critical acclaim for them. Do you ever wish you had chosen popular movies for the money and fame and sod the critics? Troy_McClure It was never a question for me. I was once in two very popular films. When I was cast in 40 Carats, Zsa Zsa Gabor was very upset and wrote in the papers and Elizabeth Taylor, who I knew, was upset and didn’t know why I’d got the part – and was probably right. I wasn’t from New York as the character was supposed to be. I had a heavy Norwegian accent and wasn’t known to be a comedian. I danced with Gene Kelly and didn’t know how to dance. I was meant to be 40 and the man I was in love with was meant to be 20 but we were both 35. It made no sense. That may be one of the reasons that when Superman came along I wasn’t the first choice.Why oh why did you make Lost Horizon? I am genuinely curious. DuncanT I don’t know. I was nominated for an Oscar. I did four things in one year and then I went back to Sweden and did Scenes from a Marriage. I was tremendously happy I could go back to the island, sit on an outdoor toilet and look out. I was on the cover of Time magazine and they called me “The new Greta Garbo”, but I was happy that it really didn’t happen. When I was doing Anna Christie on Broadway I saw Garbo in the street and ran after her. I thought: “She has to know I’m doing Anna Christie!” As if that was of interest to her! She saw this woman coming running and she started to run. I ran after her and in the end she disappeared into Central Park. Yes, she outpaced me. But when she turned and looked so frightened I gave up and didn’t follow her. I was younger; I could have made it, but I didn’t. In your career which film roles would you say were the most personal to you? MattN89 The Emigrants and The New Land. Beautiful love stories to those who understand that to stay at home is of greater danger to their children and themselves than to find a new place to live. I experienced everything I hadn’t experienced myself – to have many children and be the best friend of the one man in my life. I loved Miss Julie. Jessica Chastain and Colin Farrell were great in it, and Samantha Morton is always excellent. Are there any other mainstream actors you would be interested in working with? keithchris Well I worked with one I loved, Cate Blanchett, in the theatre when I directed A Streetcar Named Desire. It was incredible. We found each other. We did it in the US and the critics said we needed an Australian and a Norwegian to show us what Tennessee Williams was all about. I was going to direct a film of A Doll’s House with Kate Winslet. She waited two years for me to raise money and in the end we didn’t. I’m not going to direct any more, unfortunately. After Christmas I will just talk about my life as an actor, about refugees and meeting people. I should know when to stop. For many years I wanted to write a book called The Blue Hour about when you are 70-80 years old. Just before it goes dark outside, it’s blue and hopeful and everything is still possible. But after turning 80, it’s not blue light any more. Now it’s something else. It’s not darkness. Maybe it’s the thing the man around the tree in Japan said – we celebrate the beauty of life and that it’s short. Most of all we celebrate the hope that each individual, every day, can allow God or the higher power or something that is much more extraordinary than we are, to do something. Sometimes those women spoke to me in Japanese and I spoke to them in Norwegian and we bonded still and held hands. I got notes from them and sent them some. They have a story to tell but are not going to write it. I would like to. I would like to write about old age in a different way. How do you choose a movie to watch? AlexHD By who made them, what it’s about and what I’ve read about it. I don’t do Netflix or any of those things as I’m not technically educated but I get a lot of DVDs because I vote for the awards. This year I liked the one Jane Campion did [The Power of the Dog] and the one about deaf people [Coda]. I’m very bad with names. I grew up being educated by movies from the age of 11. Everything my mother told me wasn’t so! It was what Orson Welles or Chaplin told me. How are things? Granadapanda I’m very proud of my honorary Oscar. I wish my mother and father were here [to see it], that would be nice. It’s nice but on the other hand it has to be. I used to say that life is very unfair. That I should be happy and think what a wonderful thing, while people are losing their lives because of evil or no commitment from others. It’s very hard to be happy that you have a reason to be happy. Because we are all together in this short life and it’s very unfair.  The BFI’s Liv Ullmann season runs from 28 March until 30 April.

3/24/2022,"A hotel association in Venice is hatching plans to fend off “aggressive and annoying” gulls, although some hoteliers are already taking matters into their own hands by equipping guests with pistols to shoot water at the marauding birds. The omnipresence of gulls in the famous lagoon city has become increasingly problematic over the last few years – one recently snatched an ice-cream from a tourist as she walked across St Mark’s Square. Entertaining though the scene was for onlookers, the Venice hoteliers’ association has finally had enough, and so organised a seminar to come up with ideas to deter the food snatchers from outside dining areas. “The huge number seagulls, in addition to being an aggressive and annoying presence for people, represent a problem for health and hygiene, as well as for buildings and the environment,” said Francesco Boemo, a hygiene and environment expert who coordinated the seminar, adding that the association must use solutions that can deter the birds in an uncruel way. “They are, in fact, a protected species and cannot be eliminated, as is done, for example, with mice.” Solutions discussed include hiring a falconer to hunt the gulls or deterring them with a special acoustic system or unpleasant odours (albeit ones that cannot be perceived by human beings). “As soon as guests get up, perhaps to go to the buffet, seagulls pounce on the food and take it away,” one hotelier said, according to the minutes of the seminar. “We are forced to intervene continuously to change tablecloths, plates and glasses, which they often break. Some customers laugh about it, but others get angry.” Some hotels had tried falconers, but calling upon them every day proved to be expensive. And so two, the Gritti Palace and Hotel Monaco & Grand Canal, have now resorted to equipping guests with water pistols – all orange – after being told that gulls dislike the colour. “As soon as they see the pistols, they fly away,” Paolo Lorenzini, of the Gritti Palace, told the Italian press. “You don’t even need to use them, you just need to keep them on the table.”",News/World news,Venice hotel guests issued with water pistols to shoot gulls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/venice-hotel-guests-issued-with-water-pistols-to-shoot-gulls
3/24/2022,"Joachim Trier is the Norwegian director who gave us the disturbing telekinesis thriller Thelma (2017) and the challenging drug-addiction drama Oslo, August 31st (2011). Working with his longtime screenwriter Eskil Vogt, he has discomfited his audiences, jolted them and shocked them into realising they aren’t here for an easy ride. So if you had told me that his new film would be a tender relationship comedy with a wonderful freshness, as well as touches of Nora Ephron and David Nicholls, and that it would have me covertly choking up, sneaking looks to left and right to make sure no one was seeing me sniffling … well I wouldn’t have believed you. But that is what has happened. Trier has taken on one of the most difficult genres imaginable, the romantic drama, and combined it with another very tricky style – the coming-of-ager – to craft something gloriously sweet and beguiling. It’s a kind of non-Rake’s Progress, or innocent’s progress, in 13 chapters, embarked on by the twentysomething heroine, Julie. Renate Reinsve is the actor who takes on this role and she takes off like a rocket, deserving star status to rival Lily James or Alicia Vikander for her tremendously mature, sensitive and sympathetic performance. And where does the title come from? Surely it can’t apply to Julie herself; she admittedly dumps two men in the course of the film, cheating on and lying to the second, but we don’t for a moment think of her as anything other than vulnerable, flawed and human. Like anyone else in their 20s, she is terrified of the terrible irreversibility of life choices. Maybe the title applies to her formidable second boyfriend, the brilliant but haughty comic-book artist called Aksel (played by the Trier regular Anders Danielsen Lie) who is renowned for an aggressively sexual graphic novel series in the R Crumb style, which will soon get him into trouble with a new generation of feminists. Julie starts out hilariously unsure about what she wants to do with her life. She is initially a medical student but then, with wide-eyed certainty, tells her long-suffering mum she wants to change course to psychology – loftily declaring that she finds the mind more interesting than the body – and then decides she wants to go into photography. She begins a relationship with a gorgeous young guy that she, with magnificent unprofessionalism, starts snogging in the middle of a photo shoot and then leaves him at a party for the smoulderingly fascinating Aksel. But as her 20s progress, she finds that Aksel is becoming more and more famous while she is still working in a bookshop, her photography now abandoned for vague ideas about Carrie Bradshaw-type journalism or confessional fiction. Things come to a crunch when she leaves Aksel’s latest launch party early and has an intense encounter with a guy called Eivind (Herbert Nordrum) who also works in a shop. Has she, apparently heartsinkingly, found her level in life? There are two sensational set-pieces: one when she finally plucks up the courage to tell Aksel she is leaving him, and the whole world goes into freeze-frame while she runs through the Oslo streets to find Eivind and kiss him. The second comes when she takes shrooms with Eivind and his friends, an absolute showstopper of a drug-hallucination dream sequence in which Julie finally confronts her deadbeat estranged dad. This film is sweet and gentle and funny, in ways that are undoubtedly conventional but also very real. It’s the kind of film we’ve all seen done so badly that it’s an unexpected treat to see it done well and to realise that its themes are very important: who do you fall in love with? Who is “the one”? When do you realise that you are just settling? Reinsve’s performance is just so good. A star is born.

3/24/2022,"The woman in labour stared out from the stretcher, as medics rushed her over a wasteland left by a Russian attack on a maternity hospital. Feeling her baby slip away, she begged doctors: “Kill me now.” Hours later, both she and her unborn child were dead. The horror of the attack on a maternity hospital in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol stunned the world. But it was not the first time Russian bombs had fallen on women as they gave birth. As Russian strikes reduce Ukrainian cities to ruin – killing, injuring and terrorising thousands of civilians – comparisons have been made with the second world war, but there was a much more recent precedent. The tactics, and even some of Russia’s soldiers, have come direct from the civil war in Syria - which Moscow joined in 2015 to support Bashar al-Assad. Since then it has carried out a brutal but ultimately successful campaign – helping Assad seize back nearly all of the country from rebel hands. In the process entire cities have been devastated and up to 24,743 civilians allegedly killed by Russian strikes, according to the civilian harm monitor Airwars. From the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, to the great cultural and economic powerhouse of Aleppo, Russian bombs hit hospitals, schools, markets, queues of people waiting for bread. Its planes helped enforce Syrian sieges on the ground, reducing people to desperate skeletons. And when Russia and the Syrian army promised exit routes, they sometimes bombed and shot the civilians trying to flee. Some observers predicted Putin would not import the tactics of Syria to Ukraine because of close ties of family and friendship that straddle the border. While Syrians were distant, anonymous victims to most in Russia, the people of Mariupol include relatives, classmates and former colleagues. But over the past month, the targets have been the same: hospitals, schools, markets, bread queues, a theatre. Russian troops have promised escapes and then attacked civilians on the roads. Below is an examination of five key elements of the “Syria playbook”, looking at how the tactics from one war have been imported to devastating effect into another. Syrian and Russian forces besieged multiple cities in Syria to starve them into submission, effectively holding civilians hostage as forces moved in on rebel fighters. Perhaps the most notorious was the siege of Aleppo in 2016. Syrian rebels were first cut off from their supply lines and then squeezed, street by street, over more than six months, while indiscriminate bombing took place. By 2017, 4.9 million Syrians in need of humanitarian assistance were living in besieged or hard-to-reach areas. Now the same is happening in Mariupol, where Russian forces are closing in on Ukrainian forces trapped between their front lines and the sea. As the fighting rages civilians are barred from leaving, civilian infrastructure is being targeted, and life has become a daily gamble. Russian forces appeared to be attempting a similar blockade of the capital, Kyiv, and the key eastern city of Kharkiv, but so far Ukrainian forces have been able to keep supply lines open. In both Syria and Ukraine Russia and its allies have made military targets out of the civilian heart of communities – places ordinary people go for medical care, education and food and other necessities. Deliberately targeting civilians is illegal under international law, but it can also be effective. It spreads terror, saps the will of fighters and destroys the community they rely on for practical and moral support. During the eight-month Battle of Aleppo, civilians were reportedly harmed in at least 16 attacks on hospitals, accounting for up to 143 alleged deaths, according to Airwars. Across the rest of Syria, dozens of other strikes on healthcare facilities have been documented, including multiple attacks that have been tied directly to Russian forces. “We documented numerous attacks on hospitals by precision Russian weapons demonstrating a clear desire to target hospitals - which are protected under international humanitarian law,” Marc Garlasco, a war crimes investigator who analysed Russian activity in Syria for the United Nations, said. “It was shocking.” The World Health Organization has documented at least 43 attacks on healthcare in Ukraine since the war began, with at least 12 people killed. Countless other patients have had their healthcare disrupted by siege, including children on a cancer ward who are trapped in Chernihiv and running out of painkillers. Simply feeding your family becomes unsafe under Russian assault. Since 2015, civilians have been killed or injured in 204 reported attacks on marketplaces by Russian or Syrian government forces, according to Airwars data. This was five times the number of such allegations about the US-led coalition against Islamic State during the same period. Schools too have been attacked; in Syria children were killed while studying. In Ukraine because education has been halted, no students were at their desks when bombs hit, but there have been casualties. In Mariupol a missile hit an art school sheltering at least 400 people. And even when there are no deaths, damaging or destroying schools rips out the heart of a community and its future; in eastern Kharkiv alone the mayor said 48 schools had been destroyed. Nationwide hundreds have been hit. Water, gas and power supplies were hit in Syria. In Ukraine, an attack on a power station in the east came even before Russia launched its full invasion, and utility supplies have been disrupted around the country. This is particularly devastating in the bitter Ukrainian winter. In Ukraine, Russian forces have deployed indiscriminate weapons when targeting residential areas of towns and villages, reducing entire settlements to rubble. The largest-scale devastation has taken place in districts of Mariupol, where fires extended the work of bombing. But other towns have been attacked in this way, including eastern Volnovakha and Schastia which were targeted early in the war. Locals say 90 percent of Volnavakha has been razed or damaged. The civilian toll of this kind of attack is high. Many people are killed, bodies cannot be buried and surviving residents have spent days sheltering in freezing basements without water, their food supplies dwindling, and hopes of an evacuation repeatedly dashed. Again the echoes of Syria are clear - with videos of the ruins reminiscent of footage from Aleppo. In Syria Russian forces allegedly used so-called vacuum missiles – a particularly deadly explosive that can suck the oxygen from the air – hundreds of times in heavily populated neighbourhoods. Russia has also used other inherently indiscriminate weapons in both countries including cluster bombs, which scatter from a delivery case, and grad rockets – indiscriminate and unguided weapons designed for open battlefields. Civilian harm allegations have resulted from cluster munitions reported 567 times in Syria, with at least 2,000 civilians killed. They have also been widely used in Ukraine, from Kharkiv in the north-east to Mykolaiv in the south. There one man told the Guardian a neighbour had been killed and another badly injured by cluster bombs that landed in his village. “What Russian did in Syria was almost indescribable – intensive attacks destroying whole areas,” said Fadel Abdul Ghany, chair of the Syrian Network for Human Rights. He pointed to the 2018 siege of the rebel-held suburb of eastern Ghouta. “They had at least 12 airplanes shelling a civilian area and when they finished another 12 would return in their place.” Russia also used its wars to develop tactics and test new weaponry. The country’s defence minister boasted of testing more than 300 new weapon types in Syria, and in Ukraine they claim to have used new hypersonic missiles for the first time. A fourth part of the “playbook” is the announcing of so-called humanitarian corridors. In both Syria and Ukraine, Russia has appeared to offer escape routes from areas under siege or intense shelling and then at the last minute snatched away the chance of safe passage for civilians to areas beyond the conflict. The sight of buses lined up for a rescue mission, then forced to wait as bombardment continued became familiar in Syria and has been repeated in Ukraine. Perhaps the most notorious in Ukraine is Mariupol. After weeks of attack and false hopes, tens of thousands fled ad-hoc convoys of private cars, once word got out in the city that Russian checkpoints were letting civilians through. Those without cars had a brutal choice of walking for several kilometres, or staying in the ruined city. In Syria, Russia sometimes announced the corridors unilaterally without coordinating with international organisations such as the United Nations – meaning they were unable to monitor them, Emma Beals, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute, said. The corridors were sometimes open for too short of a time to be useful, were unworkable or even took civilians to areas under the control of militaries they were hiding from. “The important lesson from Syria is when military and political victory is their explicit ambition there is pretty much nothing that will cause them to stop except achieving that. And the humanitarian corridors were used as part of those goals,” Beals said. On at least seven occasions in Syria, Russia and its allies were accused of killing or injuring civilians while targeting humanitarian convoys including those carrying food, resulting in the deaths of at least 44 people, according to Airwars data. The opening of corridors, even if they are not functional, can also presage an intensified attack. “Russia then usually argues that having given this chance for departure, anyone left is a “terrorist” and as such a legitimate military target. This was the pattern most infamously in Aleppo,” said Kyle Orton, a Syria analyst. Another trademark of the “Syria playbook” is consistent denial and disinformation of civilian casualties and war crimes. To date Russia has not accepted killing a single civilian in Syria and has no known mechanism to measure the civilian impact of its actions. Since invading Ukraine its domestic propaganda machine has gone into overdrive, baring even the simple truth of calling the invasion a war. Instead it is a special operation. Putin claims that his soldiers are fighting to “denazify” a country whose president is Jewish. Internationally, Russia has attempted to deny some of its worst atrocities in Ukraine. Even the pregnant woman killed in Mariupol was not left to die in dignity – the Russian embassy in London claimed images of her final agonising moments were “fake”. That echoed attacks on the White Helmet civilian rescue group, Syrian victims of Russia’s most aggressive and successful disinformation campaigns. They gained worldwide fame for filming their rescues following bombings, but were regularly accused of faking the carnage they captured. The chief spokesperson for the Russian defence Ministry Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov even alleged, without evidence, that Ukrainian forces were planning to make “staged videos” of fake civilian deaths, in campaigns “based on patterns used by the White Helmets”. Sara Kayyali, Syria researcher at Human Rights Watch, said over several years the campaign in Syria succeeded in casting doubt among many over any allegation of civilian harm. “What we came up against was the sophisticated disinformation campaign that the Russian media, in particular, launched against people like the White Helmets. Unfortunately, in many circles, this was quite successful.” One potential further step that Russia could take to echo the war in Syria would be using chemical weapons. Russia did not use chemical weapons in Syria, but Putin’s ally Assad illegally deployed them against civilians multiple times. Syria has either denied these attacks or claimed they were “false flag” operations by rebels but the UN-aligned body that oversees chemical weapons has confirmed the Syrian regime deployed chemical agents including the nerve gas sarin. Western leaders have warned that Russia may be planning a similar attack in Ukraine. The Russian state has already used a nerve agent and a radioactive poison in attacks on British soil. Moscow’s false accusation that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons is a “clear sign” that a desperate Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself, the US president, Joe Biden, has said. Putin has also made a veiled nuclear threat by ordering nuclear deterrence forces onto high alert. That threat, if carried out, would take Putin beyond even his own brutal Syrian playbook. The western world, which has stepped back from intervention in either war even as civilians were trapped, starved and bombed, has not yet decided how it would respond.

3/24/2022,"The Football Association’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, made some interesting comments in response to questions about Qatar 2022 in a parliamentary committee hearing last week. Notable among them was the claim that the migrant workers whom the FA had met during “several trips” to Qatar, as well as “the NGOs on the ground”, were unanimous that “they want the World Cup to go ahead in Qatar”. According to Bullingham, who said the FA would brief Gareth Southgate and his players on the situation before Saturday’s match with Switzerland, the top request of workers and NGOs is that FA “keep having regular visits there … shine a light on the country and help drive positive change”. The FA is right to visit and consult with the organisations the Qatari government allows to have a presence there, but a few meetings with a handful of migrant workers is hardly the basis for a prevalence claim. The week before Bullingham’s comments, a coalition of NGOs, including the groups who have conducted the overwhelming majority of the independent research on migrant workers’ rights in Qatar, provided a detailed briefing to the FA and painted a far less rosy picture. Human Rights Watch, for example, told of an ongoing case in which workers for a company with “multiple ongoing projects related to the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022” had not been paid for five months. FairSquare, who I represented at the meeting, and Amnesty International were also seriously concerned about the lack of progress on labour reforms. Southgate and his players’ creditable stance on the issue of racial justice has led commentators such as Rod Liddle, Julia Hartley-Brewer and Tim Montgomerie to make accusations of hypocrisy over a failure to protest about human rights in Qatar. Thankfully, England’s impressive group of young players either aren’t aware or aren’t bothered by such sneering and have expressed a willingness to take on the issue. “One of the incredible things that has come out of this group is that people try and make a difference all the time,” Conor Coady has said. “That is constantly happening in this squad, people trying to use their platform to make a difference.” The FA should be showing them the way. Here’s how it can do that. There are a broad range of very serious problems in Qatar and multiple actors with different views on the reform process. Football associations and teams who want to make a difference should make simple calls on issues where there is no room for the type of debate that will leave them unsure of their footing. And there is one issue where none of the organisations working on this issue would disagree. Qatar 2022 has led to tremendous harm and suffering for many migrant workers and families whose loved ones never returned. “Now everything is shattered,” the wife of a 34-year-old Nepalese man who died in Qatar from unspecified causes in 2020 told Amnesty International. She has been left to raise two young children alone. “Since becoming a widow, I get 2,000 rupees [US$16] monthly from the [Nepali] government. Sometimes when I get a job, I go to work on roads, farm and drainage. It is the only way to meet the family’s needs.” There have been thousands of deaths of young men like this in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup, significantly more than half of them unexplained. No answer for families. No closure. No remedy for their loss. To that can be added millions of dollars of wage theft that have left workers and their families from some of the world’s poorest countries indebted and destitute. A very large pile of newspaper articles and chunky reports are testament that all this happened in the course of the colossal construction programme Qatar had to push through to be ready for the World Cup. The football associations whose teams will participate in Qatar 2022 stand to make millions from doing so. That should jar with people’s basic sense of justice when it is set in the context of such tragedy and loss. The FA can step up and show the way for other football associations by publicly supporting calls for compensation and remedy for migrant workers and their families. This advice was relayed very clearly to the FA in our meeting. If Southgate and his players choose to add their support, that would lend significant momentum to calls that could transform many thousands of lives for the better.

It made me nervous, but the beer was excellent. Ashwini I arrived at the agreed time. I thought: God, he’s so young. Like a blond Harry Potter. George I had pasta and beef ragu, and a hazy pale ale. We made a conscious effort to lay out some common ground before we got into politics. Ashwini I had the lobster mac and cheese. But we were talking so much I don’t think either of us finished our meals. I’m chatty, but he was doing a lot of talking. George She went over her experience of having lived in Italy and her perspective on the right to live and work abroad. I’m a democratic socialist, so I can’t be in favour of the European Union because it is a fundamentally capitalist and neoliberal project. Ashwini I feel very sad about Brexit – it’s denying opportunities to the younger generation. George The right to live and work abroad isn’t necessarily a universal good. For me, a surplus of labour is detrimental because it depresses wages. It is detrimental for migrant labourers, because they’re willing to settle for less, which means they can undercut British workers’ wages. Ashwini That’s not the EU’s fault. It comes down to the employers exploiting the workforce. George We agreed that migrant labourers should be treated better. But if the EU is allowing free movement of labour, it should have a hand in regulating workers’ rights, and it hasn’t done enough. I’m very much for abolishing the EU. Ashwini It does need reform, but he took a Dominic Cummings approach of razing it to the ground and starting again. I don’t think that’s practical. Ashwini Neither of us agree with vaccine mandates because where do you stop? We were talking about employers who say they aren’t going to offer full sick pay for anyone who got Covid while unvaccinated. At what point can your employer start demanding things about your health status? George Mandatory vaccinations are a step towards authoritarianism. Ashwini We both agreed that this government is just awful. Although I have never voted Labour, I would if it meant getting the Tories out. George Labour needs to be electable. But that cannot come at the expense of its principles. Labour is, in its constitution, a democratic socialist party, not a neoliberal centre-left party. I was willing to give Keir Starmer a chance, but he has broken so many promises he made in his election campaign. Ashwini No one’s saying that you have to completely trash your principles. Later on, he did sort of say if it came to a Johnson v Starmer contest in 2024, he would vote Starmer – well, surely that’s you sacrificing your principles for electability? George I will vote based on the policy platform that Labour puts forward. Ashwini I thought it was lovely that someone so young had such an interest in politics. But I wonder whether his more binary viewpoints come from a lack of life experience. That sounds awfully patronising, and I really don’t mean to be. George Both of us only became politically engaged from around 2016. I think it’s fine for an 18-year-old to be politically ignorant or inactive, but I don’t think it’s a good thing for adults to go through a large part of their life and only start engaging in politics because something’s gone wrong. Ashwini We shook hands at the end – it was friendly. George I enjoyed that we didn’t agree on everything; it was a healthy debate.  Ashwini and George ate at Ducie Street Warehouse in Manchester.

3/24/2022,"At age 97, Henry Jones is preparing to move out of the house he called home for more than 70 years, a modest dwelling he built in Freeport, Texas. The exterior is a cool, teal color; the interior walls are lined with family memorabilia and intricate wooden detail. This, he says, is where the best memories of his life have taken place. The process of leaving, however, has made for some of the worst. Jones is one of the final residents of the city’s East End, a historically Black neighborhood that became encircled by industry throughout the 20th century, much of it related to Port Freeport. Like many residents in the neighborhood, Jones’s relationship to the port has evolved over time: when he was younger, he took shifts loading and unloading ships, work he says was hard but helped him provide for his growing family. Now, the port is no longer Jones’ employer but is in the process of acquiring his land against his will, utilizing its status as an independent governmental body to lay claim to the land he built a life on. The majority of his friends and neighbors are already gone; as of October 2021, Port Freeport claimed to have obtained 95% of property in the East End as part of an extensive expansion plan. “What I accumulated, I thought I would enjoy it and my family [would] inherit it,” Jones says. “Now, everything’s going to pieces while I’m here.” Many former East End residents echo Jones’s upset at the way their community has been displaced – churches, businesses and homes – in a way some describe as systematic. The methods the port has used, including eminent domain and house “swaps”, are the subject of ongoing legal disputes. But the displacement happening in East End today is also just the latest chapter in a long history of Black land dispossession that has taken place in Freeport. In 1930, Freeport established East End as a “Negro reservation”, requiring all Black residents to live there, with the exception of those who were servants to white families. When he first arrived in 1949, Jones remembers the neighborhood had no adequate sewage system, no paved roads. In the years that followed, neighbors helped build each other’s homes and businesses until it was possible to get the food you needed, the haircut you wanted, and send your children to church all within walking distance. The city never did pave those roads, but a real community formed in the East End, and Jones’s house became a home, lively and full, with four children and a backyard garden with chickens. The story of how the East End was dismantled, bit by bit, is also part of a much larger tale of how marginalized communities are often sacrificed in the US to make way for industry. In that process, families like Jones’s are stripped of the generational wealth they believed a lifetime of work would earn; the American dream, as it had been described to them. Port Freeport was established in 1925, bringing a wealth of new jobs to an area that, at the time, was largely centered around the Stauffer Chemical Company. Over decades, it grew to generate billions of dollars in economic activity each year, attracting a roster of big businesses like Dole and petrochemical companies like Phillips 66. More residents moved in, as well, and the East End became more diverse, with a large Hispanic population. Today it is one of the largest water ports in the US, ranked 31st largest in terms of annual tonnage by the army corp of engineers in 2017. And it’s set to get even bigger. In 2014, Congress authorized a project to deepen and partially widen the Freeport Harbor Channel – which, once completed, would allow the port to accommodate bigger boats. As part of the expansion project, the port has said it needs to acquire the land that East End is built on. In an op-ed published last year, the port’s CEO, Phyllis Saathoff, framed the acquisition as integral to the project, saying it would “facilitate additional international commerce and allow for the efficient management of truck traffic, reducing both congestion and emissions”. Saathoff has also stated the port only started buying up East End land in 1999. But former and current residents say they remember the port’s encroachment starting earlier. One former East End resident, Lila Mae Lloyd, has a folder of newspaper clippings that she says chart the port’s actions over the years, including examples of creeping acquisitions away from the coast. In the 1990s, that included a land swap with two businesses, foreshadowing what was to come for some East End residents. Sisters Edmeryl and Angie Williams say they first heard about the port’s plans to buy up their neighborhood when they were in high school – they’re now in their 60s. And while the port did not authorize using eminent domain there until 2019, residents voiced concerns about their homes being taken through this process at Freeport city council meetings as early as 2016. For Robert Koole, the first sign of trouble came from the city of Freeport, rather than the port itself. After moving back to his childhood home in 2018, Koole says the city repeatedly denied his permit requests to make structural improvements. Similar complaints from other East End landowners and residents are a part of a Title VI complaint against Port Freeport and the city of Freeport for racial discrimination. “The relative value of [those properties] dropped based on the lack of city services,” says Amy Dinn, of Lone Star Legal Aid, who is representing the residents. “You can see how [the defendants] were systematically trying to remove the homes from the East End or devalue them.” The complaint, originally filed in 2017, cycled through the court system for years before being picked up by the Biden administration’s Department of Homeland Security for review to determine whether the agency will pursue an investigation. City officials representing the East End did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. However, Freeport’s mayor, Brooks Bass, and city manager, Tim Kelty, released a statement on the port’s use of eminent domain in the city last year, saying in part that the city has tried to “convince” the Port to “develop elsewhere” rather than the East End. Koole was eventually able to secure the permits and install a new fence and siding to his home. Still, there were other neighborhood issues, like potholes in the road, that he says the city continued to ignore. The onset of the pandemic in 2020 was the final straw – Koole accepted an eminent domain offer that he expects will be less than $100,000 once it is divided up with the other property heirs. He’s now living with his sister, so far unable to find a new place of his own that he can afford. “I would’ve been happy to live in that house the rest of my life – small community that I grew up in, it’s near the beach,” Koole says. “Everything that I wanted, right there.” Not everyone who sold their home to the port is unsatisfied. Jessie Parker grew up in the East End and moved back as an adult, in part to fight for her family home. For years, she was a regular in city council meetings, speaking out about the conditions in the East End and what she described as harassment from the port. Then, she says she received an offer from the port “she couldn’t refuse”. In December, she attended a council meeting with a different message – thanking the mayor for helping with her settlement. Others who made deals with the port – including residents who agreed to “swap” deals – have returned to the council with new complaints. More than three dozen households accepted offers to trade their East End homes for Port-owned and developed properties, most located a few miles away, according to the Port and the Title VI complaint. As the complaint lays out, some who made the swap say their new houses have been plagued by issues, including improper drainage, and that residents did not necessarily receive the features they were promised. It also alleges that multiple houses are located in a 100-year floodplain, which is of particular concern given the coastal location – this past summer, the area was hit by Hurricane Nicholas. The East End is the highest area in Freeport, so many of the residents had never purchased flood insurance before, adding another cost into the exchange. Contracts reviewed by Lone Star Legal Aid and the Guardian show the port also has right of first refusal on the properties for five years. That means if residents decide to leave within that period, they would have to offer the house back to the port at a set rate, rather than being able to sell it at market value. The Williams sisters attended meetings about the swap house deals but decided against taking them. “They thought this once was worthless,” Edmeryl Williams says, sitting on the lawn she and her sisters helped plant as children in front of her East End home. “They put us here.” In other words, while the land the swap properties were built on might not be valuable to the Port now, that could also change in the future, she believes. Edmeryl and her sister are among the dwindling East End contingent that continues to attend city council meetings. Others include Pam Tilley, the daughter of Henry Jones, who is pushing for historic recognition of the neighborhood. She points to its designation as a “Negro reservation” and its ties to the Levi Jordan Plantation, which itself is a designated historic site. Many early East End residents also originally came from the plantation.It’s a value she’s not alone in recognizing – the non-profit Preservation Texas named Freeport the most endangered neighborhood in the state this year based on its historic, architectural and cultural value. The organization is calling for a “comprehensive architectural survey” of the area and for the Port to consider alternatives to tearing down the remaining homes. For example, they could be moved together to offer a small glimpse at what the neighborhood once looked like. Tilley, the Williams sisters and a group of others with connections to the East End are also organizing in hopes of preserving stories and photos. In December, Tilley held a meeting at a nearby church and urged attendees to record oral histories of their East End memories and register with the Texas Freedom Colonies Project, which supports the preservation of Black settlements. “Even if we lose every timber, every building, you still can tell the story,” Tilley said. She dreams of a cookbook that includes family recipes alongside East End history, and a memorial that could stand testament to the hard work residents put in to turn this industrial pocket into a community. But for now, she says the task of negotiating with the Port is all-consuming. She recently rejected an offer for her father’s house that she says would have given him less than $200,000 in total for his property and to help with relocation. Tilley is pushing for a more in-depth inspection of her father’s property to get a better idea of its historical value and mineral value, given the pipelines she has long been told exist under the land. Pollution is one legacy of the East End that will live on with many of its former residents – the area had a documented cancer cluster. Various former residents have been a part of settlements relating to asbestos exposure from the surrounding chemical facilities. It’s another cost they paid to live in an area they were told they had no choice but to call home, until they were given no choice but to leave. Jones also attended the church meeting, sharing some memories of Freeport with Lloyd, Parker and others scattered across the pews. They reminisced about their formerly bustling neighborhood, the neighbors and businesses and rocky dirt roads. This, Jones says, is what he imagined his retirement would be like – more time at church and more time with his community. And maybe more time in the garden he used to tend to with care behind the house he built for his family.",News/US news,‘Everything’s going to pieces’: how a port took over a Black US neighborhood,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/port-freeport-texas-east-end-historically-black-neighborhood
