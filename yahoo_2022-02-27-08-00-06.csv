2/27/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) - The war in Ukraine, and heavy sanctions Western powers have taken against Russia, will have long-lasting and serious consequences for the French farming sector, the European Union's biggest, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday. ""If you ask me to share one conviction with you this morning, it is that this crisis is here to stay, this war is here to stay,"" Macron told the Paris farm show on Saturday. Trade restrictions resulting from EU sanctions on Russia will weigh on French exports such as wine and grains, Macron said, while a further rise in energy prices will hit livestock farming. ""We are building a resilience plan,"" Macron said, adding measures would be taken to protect farmers from cost pressures and compensate lost revenues. A surge in commodity prices in the past year has benefited grain producers but squeezed livestock farmers for whom grain feed is a major cost. The government announced at the end of January a 270 million euro ($304 million) relief package for the pork sector. The crisis in Ukraine is increasing volatility in agricultural markets, with Paris wheat futures hitting a record high on Thursday. Farmers are also worried the crisis could exacerbate supply tensions in fertilisers and disrupt the spring growing season for crops. The annual Paris farm show, the Salon de l'Agriculture, is a major occasion in France and, coming less than two months before the first round of presidential elections, has drawn the major candidates. French commentators long expected Macron could use his presence at the show to officially announce he will be running for a second term, a fact nobody in France doubts. But international crises, above all Russia's invasion in Ukraine, have thwarted the president's calendar several times. While Macron spent over 12 hours at the Salon's last edition in 2020, trying to reassure farmers over the impact of Brexit and a reform of the EU's farm policy, he only spoke on Saturday for about 15 minutes.

2/27/2022,"As Ukraine buckles under Russia’s brutal invasion, sparking the worst military bloodshed on European territory since the end of World War II, European leaders are haggling over sanctions, making sure being tough won’t hurt their own economies too much in the process. Hours after the invasion began on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised “massive” sanctions that would cripple Russia’s financial standing. But it was soon clear that Russia’s tentacles are so deeply embedded in Europe’s strongest economies that punishing Putin will come at a high price. Italy has asked that luxury goods so dear to Russian oligarchs be excluded. Germany pushed for an exemption on the energy sector before eventually halting Nord Stream 2 certification but on Thursday refused to agree to block Russia from the SWIFT bank payment system. Other countries, including Hungary, dug in hard to block the toughest sanctions on the table. Former President of the European Council Donald Tusk tweeted an angry missive to European leaders who have so far blocked the sanctions. “In this war everything is real: Putin’s madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv,” he wrote Friday. “Only your sanctions are pretended. Those EU governments, which blocked tough decisions (i.e. Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves.” A damaged residential building hit by an early morning missile strike in Kyiv, Ukraine. After negotiations failed to produce the “massive sanctions” promised on Thursday, European leaders will go back to the negotiation table on Friday, likely adopting what is referred to as an “incrementalist” approach even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told them he may not speak to them again because Russian special agents are out to assassinate him. “He told us he doesn’t know whether he will be able to speak with us another time so it’s tough,” Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel said Friday, according to Reuters. “We have to know how serious the situation is in Ukraine.” On Friday, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi told reporters he was fearful for the Ukraine leader. “Zelenskyi told us that he is hiding somewhere and that Ukraine has no more time,” Draghi said according to a tweet by a reporter. “He was supposed to attend a phone call at 9.30 a.m. but he couldn’t make it.” Among the exclusions many European leaders want to “keep up their sleeves” are visa-free travel to Europe for Russian diplomats and anything that would make it difficult for nations to pay for Russian energy. Massive and targeted sanctions, agreed by EU leaders, will have severe consequences for Russia.These sanctions cover:⛔️The financial sector⛔️The energy and transport sectors⛔️A ban on the export of aircraft spare parts⛔️Access to important technology⛔️Visa policy pic.twitter.com/dp9ktDA8yP — European Commission 🇪🇺 (@EU_Commission) February 25, 2022 Leaders, speaking at the end of Thursday’s talks, admitted punishing Putin was proving difficult. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte told reporters “more work needs to be done to assess what happens if Russia is cut off” with regard to blocking Russia from using SWIFT, as has been suggested by most of the G7 leaders outside Europe. Some sanctions that are likely to go through are limiting Russia’s access to some of Europe’s financial services, prohibiting the sale of equipment to Russian oil refineries, and blocking the sale of European aircraft to Russian airlines. Also on the table are targeting specific oligarchs, like those who own property in Italy, Malta, and Spain—and whose super yachts have mostly all suspiciously disappeared from ports in Sardinia and elsewhere, likely moored in friendlier waters. One unnamed EU diplomat expressed frustration with his colleagues to the Financial Times. “The question is, what are we waiting for on the other sanctions?” he said. “If we can’t do Swift, can’t we at least not be slow on oligarchs?” Another diplomat, speaking to a Politico reporter in Brussels, was even more blunt: “We have to wait until Kyiv is carpet-bombed before we can isolate Putin economically.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/27/2022,"By Dan Williams JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Russia sees its military coordination with Israel over Syria continuing, the Russian embassy said on Saturday, after Moscow signalled displeasure with Israeli statements about the Ukraine crisis. Following the 2015 Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war, Israel set up a ""deconfliction mechanism"" with the big power to prevent them clashing inadvertently during Israeli strikes against Iranian deployments and arms transfers in the neighbouring Arab state. ""Our military officials discuss the practical issues of this substantively on a daily basis. This mechanism has proven to be useful and will continue to work,"" the Russian embassy in Israel said in a statement. But while voicing support for Israel's security needs, it also reiterated opposition to violations of Syrian sovereignty. The Israeli military, asked about prospects for continued coordination with Russia over Syria, said only that its forces ""will act when needed to counter threats, defend the people of Israel and our sovereignty"". Israel, whose main ally is the United States, condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Thursday as ""a serious violation of international order"" and has since remained largely muted on Moscow's actions. In response, Moscow - which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" - summoned the Israeli ambassador for talks. Russia's U.N. mission restated opposition to Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights. Israel captured the strategic plateau from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed it, a move that won U.S. recognition in 2019. The United States said on Thursday that there were no changes in its deconfliction mechanism with Russia over Syria, though the Ukraine crisis has sent Washington-Moscow relations spiralling.
