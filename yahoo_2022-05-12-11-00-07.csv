5/12/2022,"The six-week-long lockdown in Shanghai, along with a string of lockdowns in other cities in the surrounding Yangtze River Delta region, has dealt another heavy blow to the region's once-thriving live-streaming industry after being hit hard by a regulatory crackdown last year. Having been stuck at her Shanghai flat for 40 days straight, 27-year-old professional live-streamer Zhu Cancan said she has mostly given up the job for now. Zhu still sets a morning alarm, but not to get ready for work. She wakes up early to get a jump on buying fresh food on grocery apps. Her more relaxed schedule now usually consists of playing the Tencent Holdings mobile game Honour of Kings in the morning and an online version of Mahjong with friends in the afternoon. In the evening, she binge watches TV dramas. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

""It's basically impossible for you to sell products via live-streaming under the Shanghai lockdown. Express delivery systems are not working, so I'm unable to receive products that I planned to sell. Teammates are also being locked in other places,"" Zhu said. ""Brands are also being hit hard, and many have already cut their budgets."" ""If you could make 200,000 yuan [US$30,000] a month in the past, now it's around 40,000, or zero,"" she added. Zhu still gets some income by posting advertisements on her social media accounts such as Weibo, the Chinese microblogging platform where she has 3.4 million followers. Zhu, from Anhui province, is one of hundreds of live-streamers whose life has been turned upside down by the Shanghai lockdown, amid disruptions to logistics flows and weakened demand in a slowing economy. In March, total retail sales of consumer goods in China declined 3.5 per cent year on year, compared with the 34.2 per cent jump last year amid a recovery from the 2020 downturn, according to official government data. Private express delivery systems, which is how goods purchased online are typically sent, have been severely disrupted by pandemic control measures. Many online merchants now keep their buyers apprised of changing conditions by sending them lists of cities and districts to which they are currently unable to ship products. In a list shared by a bookstore on Taobao, 16 provinces - including eastern Jiangsu and Zhejiang and northern Heilongjiang - have been affected. Taobao is owned by Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post. Since Shanghai's lockdown started on April 1, residents have only been able to obtain essentials through group buying and government supplies. E-commerce purchases for unessential items like books and coffee are unlikely to be delivered. Zhu said a friend in Hangzhou now only gets about two ads per month for her live-streaming channel, where she previously had ads nearly every day. ""Not only are influencers in Shanghai affected, the situation is also not good for those living outside Shanghai,"" Zhu said. ""Brands are in Shanghai, consumption power is in Shanghai, advertising companies are in Shanghai. You just can't do your work efficiently."" Zheng Liuping, a live-streamer living in Yiwu, Zhejiang province, has struggled to keep his business operating as usual during the outbreak. Yiwu, another city with a vibrant live-streaming community, conducted mass testing last month after reporting a few local Covid-19 cases. ""Many consumers cancelled their orders as they are unable to receive the products,"" Zheng said. ""Although we get a similar amount of traffic, the orders we receive are less than before."" Deng Jinling, another Yiwu resident, uses live-streaming companies to help her sell thermoses domestically. However, deliveries are often postponed or cancelled, she said. ""You may see place A locked down, and place B operating normally. Later, place A may open up, but place B is locked down. We are stuck in a cycle,"" she said. Early in the pandemic, China's live-streaming industry benefited from changing consumer habits as people were forced to do more of their shopping online while confined at home. In 2020, the scale of China's live-streaming e-commerce industry exceeded 1.2 trillion yuan, nearly triple the size of the previous year. The industry is projected to exceed 4.9 trillion yuan in 2023, according to an iResearch report published last September. The industry has also been targeted by regulators. In one of the more high-profile cases, tax authorities fined live-streaming queen Viya 1.3 billion yuan in December for tax evasion. Her official Weibo account and her Taobao shop later disappeared from the internet. Under rules jointly issued in March by the Cyberspace Administration of China, State Taxation Administration, and State Administration for Market Regulation, platforms are required to provide reports on their live-streamers twice a year, which must include details such as personal identification numbers, bank account information and income.

Photo: AFP> The situation in the live-streaming e-commerce sector shows a wider disruption of the e-commerce industry, according to Chen Tao, an e-commerce analyst at Analysys. ""The essence is the disruption of logistics flows, which affect the normal operations of the live-streaming e-commerce sector,"" he said. Chen said he expects the industry will recover once the outbreak is under control. Carrie Zhang, a Shanghai-based partner at Bain & Company, also sees potential benefits to the industry in the long run. Despite the ""short-term disturbance"", new habits have emerged among younger consumers, such as those in Generation Z, who often use live streaming and other internet videos to get information on brands. ""The industry has experienced hyper growth [over 100 per cent year on year] in the past few years,"" Zhang said, ""With major players already achieving sizeable gross merchandise value in 2021, the growth rate is expected to come down this year. However, [live streaming] is probably still going to be the fastest-growing e-commerce format in China."" For now, though, Zhu has been using this period to take a break from the constant grind of the industry, as she has been able to live on her savings. It has also helped stem the tide of constant notifications. ""Before the outbreak, I saw many new friend requests on WeChat every day when I woke up,"" she said. ""But now no one adds me.""

5/12/2022,"The family of a 15-year-old girl who went missing at a Dallas Mavericks game in April and was later found being prostituted at an Oklahoma City hotel says multiple organizations were negligent in preventing the situation from escalating. Zeke Fortenberry, an attorney who is representing the family after the incident, sent a letter to the Dallas Police Department, the American Airlines Center, the Dallas Mavericks and Extended Stay America saying that their actions or policies failed the victim and her family. On April 8, the girl and her father, who are from North Richland Hills, attended the Mavericks game at the American Airlines Center. Just before halftime, the daughter went to use the restroom but did not return. The father immediately notified American Airlines Center staff and Dallas police officers of her disappearance, according to Fortenberry’s letter. By the time the game ended, the girl had not been found, and police told the father to return to his home, Fortenberry said. Over several days, the family called the Dallas Police Department for help in locating their daughter. Fortenberry said Dallas police never began an investigation and failed to make any efforts to locate the teenage girl. The family turned to a nonprofit organization, the Texas Counter-Trafficking Initiative, and they found that the girl was being advertised and sold for sex in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City police found that she was being held at an Extended Stay America hotel and made arrests and recovered the girl on April 18. Eight people were arrested on charges including human trafficking, distribution of child pornography and rape. Fortenberry said there were multiple steps along the way that could have prevented the incident. He said the man that lured the teenage girl from the game found her in an area inside the center that he did not have a valid ticket to be in, and that the fraudulent ticket that the man had was provided by an individual known to the Dallas Mavericks and American Airlines Center as a seller of fraudulent tickets. “The Dallas Mavericks and the AAC failed to protect the victim from the man with the illegal ticket in a restricted area,” Fortenberry said. The letter also claims that Dallas police refused to investigate the case, despite the family immediately reporting the disappearance and continuously calling the department. The Dallas Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Representatives for the Mavericks, American Airlines Center and the hotel could not immediately be reached for comment. In a WFAA-TV report, Dallas police said the arena was searched, and shared this about protocol for these situations: “Texas Family Code (51.03 b. 3) dictates that missing juveniles are investigated as runaways unless there are circumstances which appear as involuntary such as a kidnapping or abduction. Those cases per code are to be filed where the juvenile resides.” Dallas police told WFAA that they assisted North Richland Hills police, who entered the victim into a national missing person database, and created a bulletin that went out to the department on April 11. Fortenberry said the incident shouldn’t have been handled as a runaway. “That’s not the case here,” he said. “She went missing at a sporting event.” Surveillance video showed the girl leaving the center with a man. The attorney’s letter says that a registered sex offender used a false name and false ID to rent multiple hotel rooms in the Extended Stay Hotel in Oklahoma City. The teen was held at the hotel for multiple nights and was sexually assaulted there. Fortenberry said there were textbook signs of human trafficking at the hotel and employees should be trained and should respond to those red flags. “It’s a series of failures that ultimately led to this,” Fortenberry said. Fortenberry said the letter he sent to those entities was to initiate a conversation and ensure that policies or actions are changed within these organizations to make sure that a similar incident can be prevented. He said his firm is giving each organization about 30 days to respond to the letter before taking any kind of legal action.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,Family: Sex trafficking of North Texas teen taken from Mavs game could’ve been prevented,https://news.yahoo.com/family-sex-trafficking-north-texas-003255569.html
5/12/2022,"The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to dig his heels in over the war in Ukraine and let it drag on for some time—and along the way, Putin might resort to extreme measures to ensure Russia wins in the end, top U.S. spies warned Tuesday. The next steps Putin might take include escalating domestic measures that could contribute to the war effort, such as instituting martial law, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines warned in a Tuesday briefing. “The uncertain nature of the battle... combined with the reality that Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia's current conventional military capabilities likely means the next few months could [be] more unpredictable and potentially escalatory,” DNI Haines told senators. “The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on.” The assessment, which Haines delivered to lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday, comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its 76th day. Russian forces have turned their attention to taking Eastern Ukraine in recent weeks after failing to take the capital, Kyiv, in the early days of the war due to a series of logistical and planning issues. And as the Russian military has shifted its attention to the Donbas, or eastern portions of Ukraine, the fighting is beginning to reach somewhat of a “stalemate,” the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director, Scott Berrier, said Tuesday. ‘They Can Fuck Off With This War’: Putin’s Troops Finally Realize They’ve Been Hung Out to Dry “I would characterize it as the Russians aren't winning, and the Ukrainians aren't winning, and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here,” Berrier said. Putin doesn’t view the Donbas as the final stand in Ukraine, though, Haines warned, suggesting that more carnage might be on the way. Putin views it as just a “temporary” focus so that the Russian military can “regain the initiative,” Haines said. “We are not confident that the fight in the Donbas will effectively end the war,” Haines said. “We assess President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas.” The assessment that Putin might escalate comes a day after Victory Day in Russia, when Russians celebrate the victory in World War II—a day U.S. and Ukrainian officials alike had warned Putin would seize on to mobilize more troops for the war. Victory Day came and went without any public mobilization, however. But Russians are starting to see signs that Putin might be secretly putting in the legwork to pull in more resources to make the war effort function beyond the near term, just as Haines is warning Putin has his sights set on doubling down. Moscow Metro employees have been threatened in recent days that they might be sent to the war in a possible mobilization “if there are not enough soldiers to be sent to the ‘special operation,’” one of the employees’ wives told the Coalition for Conscientious Objection to Military Service in Russia and Verstka.media, using the term Russia has been using to describe the war in Ukraine. “At a meeting in the metro depot… all men were ordered to undergo an extraordinary medical examination for subsequent possible sending to the war in Ukraine,” she said, adding that if they disobeyed they were told they could be fired or face criminal accusations. “It was precisely and clearly stated that the leadership is obliged to allocate a certain number of people for possible sending to the war.” The Daily Beast has not independently verified the claims. Russia has already lost tens of thousands of troops in the invasion and for weeks has been looking for alternative sources of manpower. Russia’s been looking to Syria for more fighters, the Wall Street Journal reported, and Russia’s defense minister has said Russia is recruiting 16,000 people from the Middle East to fight in Ukraine, too. Members of Congress have been questioning the U.S. intelligence community for weeks now about whether the Kremlin has tapped into mercenaries working for a private Russian contractor known as the Wagner Group. Haines confirmed Tuesday the Russian government has indeed pulled Wagner in for operations in Ukraine. “We do see Wagner being used in ... Ukraine. We see that,” Haines said. “Russia deployed them effectively in Ukraine.” Putin’s Private Army Accused of Raping New Moms on Maternity Ward The U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Putin intends the war to last for some time could spell disaster ahead. Putin could become more likely to make a miscalculation and resort to using nuclear weapons, Haines warned. Putin would only “authorize the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state,” she said, adding that “with tensions this high there is always an enhanced potential for miscalculation—unintended escalation.” “There is not… an imminent potential for Putin to use nuclear weapons,” Haines clarified.

5/12/2022,"By James Pearson NEWPORT, Wales (Reuters) -Russia was behind a massive cyberattack against a satellite internet network that took tens of thousands of modems offline at the onset of Russia-Ukraine war, the United States, Britain, Canada, Estonia and the European Union said on Tuesday. The digital assault against Viasat's KA-SAT network in late February took place just as Russian armour pushed into Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the cyberattack was intended ""to disrupt Ukrainian command and control during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other European countries"". British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called the satellite internet hack ""deliberate and malicious"" and the Council of the EU said it caused ""indiscriminate communication outages"" in Ukraine and several EU member states. The Viasat outage remains the most publicly visible cyberattack carried out since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part because the hack had immediate knock-on consequences for satellite internet users across Europe and because the crippled modems often had to be replaced manually. ""After those modems were knocked offline it wasn't like you unplug them and plug them back in and reboot and they come back,"" the U.S. National Security Agency's Director of Cybersecurity Rob Joyce told Reuters on the sidelines of a cybersecurity conference on Tuesday. ""They were down and down hard; they had to go back to the factory to be swapped out."" The precise consequences of the hack on the Ukrainian battlefield have not been made public, but government contracts reviewed by Reuters show that KA-SAT has provided internet connectivity to Ukrainian military and police units. The satellite modem sabotage caused a ""huge loss in communications in the very beginning of war"", Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora said in March. In a statement, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection said that Russia ""is an aggressor country attacking Ukraine not only on our land, but in cyberspace too"". The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Russia routinely denies it carries out offensive cyber operations. Viasat said in a statement that it ""recognised"" the announcement and would continue to work with government officials to investigate the hack. The company did not provide an update on a Viasat official's comments to Reuters in late March that the hackers were still trying to interfere with the company's operations, albeit to limited effect. [L2N2VW2XC] The satellite modem-wrecking cyberattack remains the most visible hack of the war, but many others have taken place since and not all of them have been made public. ""That was the biggest single event,"" said Joyce. ""It certainly had new and novel tradecraft, but there have been multiple attacks."" SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk said his company's Starlink satellite broadband service, which is available in Ukraine, had resisted Russian cyberwar jamming and hacking attempts, though adding in a post on Twitter: ""They’re ramping up their efforts"".
