5/20/2022,"By Neil Jerome Morales and Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines president-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Wednesday said his country's ties with China will expand and ""shift to a higher gear"" when he takes power, signalling intent to advance outgoing leader Rodrigo Duterte's pro-Beijing agenda. Marcos, who won last week's election by a landslide, said he held ""very substantial"" talks by phone on Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who assured him of support for his ""independent foreign policy"", and agreed to hold more comprehensive discussions. The 64-year-old son and namesake of the notorious former dictator said Xi also acknowledged his late father's role in opening diplomatic relations between China and former U.S. colony the Philippines. ""The way forward is to expand our relationship not only diplomatic, not only trade, but also in culture, even in education, even in knowledge, even in health, to address whatever minor disagreements that we have right now,"" Marcos said in a statement. ""I told him, we must not allow what conflicts or difficulties we have now between our two countries to become historically important."" The Philippines and China have had a rocky relationship in recent years over Beijing's vast territorial claims and conduct of its coast guard and fishing fleet in the South China Sea, through which at least $3.4 trillion of annual trade passes. Many analysts expect Marcos to seek stronger ties with Beijing, but say maintaining close relations with defence ally Washington will be essential in keeping the military and the public onside in a country with historically strong links to the United States. Their phone conversation focused on bilateral ties and regional development, the Chinese embassy in Manila said in a separate statement. Xi said both countries should carry forward their friendship, grasp the general trend and follow through the blueprint for bilateral friendly cooperation, the embassy added. Marcos won the presidency with nearly 59% of the votes last week. He will take office late in June. China was among the first to congratulate Marcos, who was the first win a presidential election by an outright majority since a 1986 revolution that toppled his late father's two-decade dictatorship. Kurt Campbell, the White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, last week said the United States would seek early engagement with the Marcos administration, but said there were ""historical considerations"" that could pose challenges. Marcos said Xi had expressed a desire to talking privately. ""We are both looking forward to having further dialogue,"" Marcos said. ""He said both of us should talk, without the others.""

5/20/2022,"A TikToker is going viral after sharing how Airbnb arbitrage properties changed her life. The post comes from The KarWells (@thekarwells), two friends who run a successful real estate business and a TikTok page full of investing tips. In one of the page’s most popular clips, Sarah Glidewell, one half of The KarWells, recently explained how she went from making $50,000 per year to over $100,000 from Airbnb rental properties. Bitcoin ETFs: What are they and how to invest in them? Her clip is just the latest in a recent trend of TikTokers embracing financial transparency on the app. In one video, a business owner detailed how she pays all of her employees — including herself — the same salary. In another, a Google employee shared how he went from having a 1.2 GPA in college to making $344,000 a year. Glidewell’s financial situation, she explained, came largely from Airbnb arbitrage properties. Typically, Airbnb hosts own the properties they rent through the vacation app. However, Airbnb arbitrage is the process of renting a property and subletting it to Airbnb guests. The process can be difficult to pull off due to legal restrictions and issues with landlords, but, as Glidewell shared, it can also be very profitable. In her clip, Glidewell explained how she was making $50,000 at her day job in 2019. Despite people encouraging her to save up for a new car, she managed to put away $20,000 to invest in her business idea instead. She used that money to start renting and furnishing four different properties, which she then listed on Airbnb. Less than three years later, she’s making between $7,000 and $15,000 per month in profit. “Had I listened to everyone else,” she said. “I’d have a two and a half-year-old vehicle, I’d still be at a nine-to-five. … All I’m saying is, stop trading what you really want for what you want right now.” Check out our men's beach and swimwear summer style guide: The business model clearly transformed Glidewell’s financial situation — The KarWells’ TikTok bio says, “Airbnb changed our lives” — but, it also left TikTokers with plenty of questions. Specifically, commenters wanted to know how, and under what circumstances, arbitrage is legal. There are local and state laws that disallow sub-leasing, as well as some places where pricing may make it difficult. Additionally, many leases forbid rental arbitrage. As Glidewell explained in the video’s comments, she had to call and negotiate with landlords directly in order to strike a deal where she could re-lease her rental. As with many recent financial stories on the app, TikTokers praised Glidewell for the insight. “Saving 40% of your salary is very impressive! Congratulations,” one user wrote. “Such a great example of true investing,” another added.

5/20/2022,"Ukrainians have been forced to turn every aspect of their life into methods of fighting the Russians, leading to some innovative weapons and tactics developed from everyday civilian items. In something more reminiscent of a video game or action movie it has been reported that Ukrainian soldiers have been using e-bikes armed with missiles to take out Russian tanks. The bikes have been given to the military by e-bike maker Delfast. Soldiers have then modified them to carry NLAW rockets or other anti-armour weapons. The UK has supplied thousands of NLAW missiles to the Ukrainian army since the start of the conflict. Read more: What is an anti-tank weapon and how do they work? They are delivered in the handheld launcher which can only be used a single time. They are designed to be operated by a single person and are relatively light - but still cost tens of thousands of pounds each. The use of the anti-tank missiles has been a key player in Ukraine's ability to slow the Russian advance on several fronts. NLAWs (or Next Generation Light Antitank Weapons) deliberately target the soft spot between the turret of the tank and the body. The targeting computer does 95% of the work, meaning all the soldier needs to do is find a safe place with a clear view of the target to fire from.

The military has utilised the silent nature of the e-bikes and their mobility to help get their soldiers into position. Militaries across the world have begun trailing e-bikes in their arsenals, usually to assist with getting soldiers quickly into position or to assist with patrols. The conflict in Ukraine is now mostly concentrated in the east and south of the country as Russian forces gave up on their wider ambitions of conquering the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv.",World/Yahoo News UK,Ukrainians using e-bikes mounted with missiles to blow up Russian tanks,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-e-bikes-mounted-missiles-blow-up-russian-tanks-175221749.html
5/20/2022,"Japan will be welcoming tourists back for the first time since the pandemic, starting with small groups of 50. According to the Japan Tourism Agency, the country will allow about 50 vaccinated-and-boosted tourists to visit at the end of this month. Tourists will be part of organized tours. This will be a test to open the borders to more people. Travelers from the United States, Australia, Thailand, and Singapore will be able to enter. These countries are priority markets to Japan. Each tour group will have four people. It is unclear how the traveler selection process will go. The Japan Tourism Agency says in a statement the limited visits will test infection prevention and emergency response. Information from the tours will go to travel agencies, travel businesses, and hotels. All tourists must be with a guide and go to areas cleared by government officials. Starting in November, Japan allowed students, foreign workers, and business travelers, but cut back later that month. In March, some visitors were allowed again, but tourists were still not allowed. Other Asian countries started welcoming visitors including Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, and South Korea. The tourism agency estimated over 100,000 people visited Japan between January and March of this year in comparison to the same months in 2019. Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says Japan would ease border restrictions in June, according to Kyodo News.",World/Travel Noire,Japan Will Allow 50 Tourists To Enter From These Four Countries,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-allow-50-tourists-enter-121500178.html
