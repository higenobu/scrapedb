3/30/2022,"On Saturday, Mike Krzyzewski’s Duke will face the University of North Carolina in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament for both the first and the last time. It sounds improbable but it’s taken until the final season of Coach K’s illustrious career for these two bitter rivals to face each other on college basketball’s biggest stage. It doesn’t feel that way because the two schools – separated by a mere 10 miles – have played each other 257 times, with every game treated as an epic clash between two giants. Duke-North Carolina has been called the biggest rivalry in college sports and has a genuine claim to being one of the most storied in all of US sports. The accompanying hype can become quite overwhelming, particularly when the athletes who decide it are largely unpaid teenagers. Much of that hype comes down to the blunt fact that most of the country hates the Duke basketball program. It doesn’t matter that the Tar Heels lead their all-time series with the Blue Devils 142-115: Duke are traditionally the “villain” in this particular matchup. Much of this is down to the perception that the rivalry boils down to a bunch of preppy snobs facing off against scrappy regular Joes. Duke is a private institution while North Carolina is a public school. Duke have a habit of showcasing some of the most disliked players in college history, from Christian Laettner to JJ Redick to Grayson Allen. It also doesn’t help that in the basketball world, Duke came to represent a certain type of white privilege. Writing for the Guardian, former NBA player Etan Thomas, who was briefly on the same Dallas Mavericks team as Laettner, summarized it as follows: “The understanding was that everything was given to Duke players, especially Christian Laettner: that he could get away with anything and everything on the floor. They reeked of entitlement and embodied everything so many people despised in a way that went beyond sports.” Or, as 2011 NBA MVP Derrick Rose once put it in a documentary: “I felt like [Duke] only recruited black players that were Uncle Toms.” Thomas, however, goes on to emphasize that the reality never fully meshed with the image and that in recent years the program has given us a wide variety of Black stars such as Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum and Zion Williamson (he also describes Laettner as “one of the coolest cats on the Mavericks”). A look at the current Duke roster led by top NBA prospect Paolo Banchero, who is multiracial, shows that the Blue Devils don’t resemble the stereotypical monochromatic teams of the increasingly distant past. But back to the present. Given that Duke and UNC have been playing one another for over a century, it’s hard to understand how they have not met in the Big Dance before. It’s to the credit, perhaps, of the chaotic nature of the NCAA tournament: the single-elimination format has established it as the most unpredictable event on the US sports calendar. In any case, this week’s game has added spice given that the next time these teams meet it will be without Krzyzewski, arguably the greatest coach in college basketball history. In the modern era, no coach has ever been as closely identified with their program as Coach K has been with the Blue Devils and – given changes in the power structure that are currently underway – it feels likely that his retirement will mark the end of an era for college coaches. In his 42 seasons with Duke, he has won five national championships and will be playing in his record 13th Final Four on 2 April. He has 1,200 wins in Division 1 basketball, placing him well ahead of the competition. Love him or hate him, and chances are it’s the latter, it’s likely he will be remembered as the greatest college basketball coach of his generation. And yet, there’s one more thing he has never done, if only because he has never had the opportunity to do so. He’s never had the chance to lead Duke to a victory over their long-time nemesis on the game’s biggest stage. So, that’s what’s at stake on Saturday: either Krzyzewski’s career will end at the hands of a North Carolina team that has already humiliated him in his final home game or he will defeat them and earn the opportunity to win one final title. If you were going to write the series finale of a long-running show, it would be hard to come up with a scenario as neat as what will take place on 2 April: one final battle between the protagonists and antagonists with everything on the line. This upcoming game between Duke and North Carolina is something we’ve never seen before and it’s something that we will never truly see again.

3/30/2022,"Ministers will “inevitably” disclose whether they have been fined by the Metropolitan police over lockdown breaches, the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, has said. The move by the Met to issue 20 fixed-penalty notices to those who attended illegal gatherings during lockdown in No 10 and Whitehall has been seen as confirmation of lawbreaking at the heart of government, although the force’s rules mean it will not disclose who the recipients are. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Raab said he accepted that the fines meant there were “clearly breaches of the regulations” in government and that “those who made the rules should be more transparent above what would normally be applied by the Met police”. Asked whether ministers would disclose fines, he said: “I think that’s inevitably the case.” He added that he would say if he were subject to a fixed-penalty notice. He said he did not expect that the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, would be expected to disclose any fine since she was not a member of government, although she shares a home with the prime minister. Downing Street has provoked fury and derision by refusing to accept that the fixed-penalty notices meant the rules had definitively been broken. Raab said he did not know whether the prime minister, Boris Johnson, would address the matter in PMQs in parliament on Wednesday. So far, Johnson is understood not to have received a fixed-penalty notice. However, the Met has made clear that the initial 20 fines are only the first tranche of referrals and further interviews are continue this week. Raab said the photos of Johnson attending a gathering in the garden of No 10 during lockdown “don’t … demonstrate” that he was at any of the parties which are believed to have resulted in the fines. In light of the fines, Raab was asked on BBC Breakfast whether Johnson had intentionally misled parliament when he told MPs that Covid regulations had not been breached in Downing Street.He said: “I think it is rather different to say that he lied. Clearly we had the investigations because of the claims, the assertions that were made, which it was right to follow up, and it is clear there were breaches of the law. But to jump from that to say the prime minister deliberately misled parliament rather than answering to the best of his ability is just not right.” Raab said Johnson had sought to address the matter by issuing an apology and overhauling his team at No 10. He said: “The prime minister has already said he accepts that things happened in No 10 that shouldn’t have happened. A new team has come and people have left.”",News/Politics,"Ministers will disclose if Met fined them over lockdown breaches, says Raab",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/ministers-will-disclose-if-met-fined-them-over-lockdown-breaches-says-raab
3/30/2022,"Harold Plaster had been awake for nine days when he noticed his face in the mirror. It was January 2017, and he was on his latest heroin binge inside a red house on the Lummi Reservation in north-western Washington state. The windows were covered in garbage bags and there were rats scurrying around. As he looked at himself, dangerously thin, he said he began thinking about his six children, all either adults or in foster care, and about his mother, who he had promised his late father he would look after. “I seen myself in the mirror, and I was like, ‘What the fuck are you doing Harold?’” he told the Guardian. He called Rosalie Scott, the director of Lummi Chemical Addiction Recovery and Education (Care), the outpatient drug and alcohol treatment and education program leading the way on addiction response on the reservation. “I don’t want to die,” he told her. Plaster had already attempted treatment more than a dozen times, but Scott didn’t hesitate. She directed him to stay put, Plaster recalled, and then added: “I’ve been praying and waiting for you to come here, Harold.” Five minutes later, another member of the Care team was outside the house. Plaster quickly collected his only belongings – backpack, blanket and clothes – and was driven to a nearby detox center. This past January, the 52-year-old ushered in five years of sobriety alongside his two youngest children, ages 12 and 15, and his new wife, in the house he grew up in, and with his mother in a nearby rest home. The Lummi Nation, a community of more than 5,500 people located on a small slice of land on the US west coast extending into the Salish Sea, has faced addiction issues on the reservation for decades. It has affected everything from crime to housing, families and foster care. And for over half a century, tribal leaders have been working to rid the reservation of drug abuse, explained Deanna Point, Scott’s interim director at Care. “We just start getting our hands on one [drug], and then right after that, once we think we’re just finally getting our hands and getting some kind of relief from this drug that’s in our community, a new one comes,” she said. In the last several years the situation has become particularly acute, due to the prevalence of highly addictive methamphetamine and then, most recently, lethal pure fentanyl, or some combination of the two. The estimated number of drug overdose deaths in the US during a 12-month period ending in April 2021 rose by 28.5% compared with the same period the year before, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Overdose deaths caused by opioids, as well as synthetic opioids – primarily fentanyl – and psychostimulants including methamphetamine, fueled the increase. While methamphetamine is highly addictive and can cause strokes and psychotic episodes, fentanyl can be lethal at just 2mg. In recent years, there has been an increase in seizures of both drugs across the country’s southern border, while at the same time they have become more widely available and cheaper, according to Dr Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. On the Lummi reservation, Point described fentanyl as “the worst one that we’ve seen yet” due to how deadly it is. When it is combined with methamphetamine the risk of an overdose can be even greater. She explained that the tribe initially struggled to identify what was causing community members to appear intoxicated because fentanyl wasn’t showing up on the drug test they were using. “After we kind of put two and two together, we started testing for fentanyl. And everybody just started testing positive left and right,” She said. At the same time, the Covid-19 pandemic has fueled stress and anxiety for tribal members as they’ve been cut off from their support networks and their cultural and sporting events are put on hold. The result for the Lummi Nation has been one of the highest number of drug relapses, according to Lummi Nation chairman William Jones Jr. As of February, Care had 342 active clients, but 39 of those in its medication assisted treatment program hadn’t been in for over 14 days, a sign that they may have relapsed, according to Rene Ramirez, a program sponsor for the opiate treatment program. Drug abuse is of course not distinct to this community. A study published in September in the journal Jama Psychiatry found that between 2015 and 2019, the number of overdose deaths associated with methamphetamine in the US increased by 180% to 15,489. When broken up by ethnicity, the report found that Native Americans and Alaska Natives had the highest rate of methamphetamine use disorder. These high numbers within the Indigenous community can be linked to historical trauma in the form of community massacres, forceful relocation and boarding schools, explained Dr Tommy K Begay, research assistant professor at the University of Arizona’s department of psychiatry and a member of the Navajo Nation. The trauma, he explained, resulted in maladaptive coping behaviors that sometimes include drug use, which were passed on to new generations. “This is not just unique to Native people,” said Begay. “You put any human being through circumstances that some individuals were placed under, we would see the same relationships.” Yet the issue of drug abuse among Native people has been neglected, said Volkow. She explained that the treatment and prevention needs to be prioritized and that the response should involve culturally appropriate treatment, as well as prevention that looks to the systemic issues at play. “Prevention will require that we actually provide support, social, economical and educational, so that you give them quality services,” she said. “The same thing pertains to healthcare, that you have to provide quality services that will help buffer and overcome the years of disparities.” Today, the Lummi Nation utilizes a combination of culturally-based healing and western-based substance abuse treatment approaches, all centered on love and compassion. The outpatient treatment program, Care, is housed in a small, one-story cream building. It offers group sessions that range from one hour a week to nine, medication assisted treatment plans, and specialized programs for those who are pregnant or have children. Group sessions typically include clients sharing a meal together, an important component of the Lummi Nation’s cultural identity, explained Point. There is also a culture room inside the facility, where clients often spend hours beading, cedar weaving and carving. “What makes our program unique is we focus a lot on our tradition and cultural values. And some people come in, they might have roots to their cultural identity, but most of them aren’t going to have roots to who they are,” she said. The tribe also connects those suffering from addiction to a wide array of programs throughout the reservation and beyond, allowing them to seamlessly access such things as detox centers, housing, parenting classes and employment training. But when the main treatment approaches don’t take, the tribe turns to measures such as banishment and withholding fishing licenses when someone doesn’t produce a clean drug test. Jones explained that recently, the tribe made the decision to allow homes of repeat offenders to be turned over to the Lummi Tribe until the person goes through treatment. It’s “just a new tool that we’re trying to use in Lummi here to help combat the drug use and the drug dealers from moving into our community”, he said. “They find someplace, they come and they move in. And they really take over a family or a home.” One house on the reservation has seen decades of tribal members work their way to recovery. Known as the Raven Home, it was a donation from a doctor in Bellingham and in the 1990s was transformed into a temporary home for those healing from chemical addiction, explained Scott. With three bedrooms, community members who may not qualify for US Housing and Urban Development housing, which comes with a lot of requirements, have been able to make use of this safe and extremely affordable space. “For our homes, that’s what we’re trying to do is to knock out all that red tape because everybody deserves a second chance,” said Point. Point knows better than most just how vital the home can be. In 2010, while healing from drug addiction, she lived there with her four children. “The Raven Home was where I learned how to be independent and to be a mom,” she said. “The support that I got from Lummi counseling here really inspired me into this field today.” The tribe is now working to add a second house, called the Salmon Home, as well as a detox center, so they no longer always have to refer community members to treatment centers off reservation, which are often full. Tribal leaders have also instituted programs to try to deter drug and alcohol abuse, including canoe clubs. Groups of young people are taken through physical training as well as cultural teachings as part of the clubs, and devote hours every week preparing for races. Akesha Martin, 30, who started paddling at one such club when she was 10 years old, said the feeling of belonging stuck with her. “I think just being able to be a part of that, and being able to be a part of that family is what really kept me grounded and able to just continue on with my life. And not ever have to experience drugs or the alcohol addiction that my family had to experience,” she said. For Plaster, whose recovery process extended far past group sessions, and into parenting classes, anger management and even his driver’s license tickets being paid off, the tribe’s programs completely changed his life. “They really wanted to help me. They really wanted me to stay clean. They wanted me to be a better person,” he said. “And that’s how they made me feel.”",News/US news,The Indigenous tribe fighting back against the addiction epidemic,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/lummi-nation-fights-addiction-epidemic-care-program
3/30/2022,"In the months after the birth of her son Adam at Royal Shrewsbury hospital in 2011, Charlotte Cheshire just felt grateful that the NHS had managed to save his life after he contracted group B streptococcus meningitis (GBS) and was placed in an induced coma. “My husband did a 23-mile sponsored walk for the hospital, raising just over £4,000, six months after Adam was born. We sent the money to them and had a photo op in the ICU with all the staff. We just didn’t know,” she said. When a friend first suggested getting a lawyer to look into the possibility of medical negligence, she was offended by the idea, and it wasn’t until 2014 that she finally spoke to a solicitor. “For a long time, would you believe, I actually felt guilty for calling a solicitor. I thought we should be grateful. Looking back on that now, how naive was I?” Adam, who was left with severe disabilities as a result of the infection, was one of 23 maternity cases at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust brought to the attention in 2016 of the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who ordered a review into the trust led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden. “Back then it was 23 cases, and I remember that number in itself seemed shocking to me,” said Cheshire. Since then the investigation has swelled enormously to include 1,862 cases including stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal deaths, and babies born with brain injuries. It has become the biggest maternity scandal in NHS history. In June 2020 West Mercia police announced they were launching a criminal investigation into the worst cases, while Ockenden’s interim report in December 2020 identified a pattern of failures at the trust, including a reluctance to conduct caesarean sections and a tendency to blame mothers for problems. But her final report, published on Wednesday after a five-year investigation, is a damning inquiry into how 300 babies died or were left brain-damaged due to inadequate care. “As horrible as it will be to read and to hear, I think it will be healing at the same time. It will be heartbreaking to read the stories, and to read how catastrophically wrong things went at that hospital, and how long it was allowed to go on for,” said Cheshire. “But it will also be vindicating and a relief. For so long, I thought I was the only one, and it was a fluke and I blamed myself. I think that’s one of the more insidious elements of this situation, because I now know how many parents thought they were the only ones.” The campaign for a review was spearheaded by Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 after contracting GBS during birth, alongside Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton, who lost their daughter Kate in 2009 shortly after she was born. Davies had notified midwives about reduced movements towards the end of her pregnancy but she was reassured she was low risk. After she was born, Kate was pale and floppy, and grunting (a sign of respiratory distress), but staff failed to act and although she was airlifted to a hospital in Birmingham for treatment, she died a short while later. Pippa was born at home, and Griffiths called midwives repeatedly when she quickly started displaying symptoms such as no interest in feeding, noisy breathing and vomiting. She was repeatedly reassured everything was fine, before Pippa stopped breathing and was airlifted to hospital where she subsequently died. Davies and Griffiths bonded over the similarity of their experiences, and suspecting they were not the only ones who had been let down by the trust, gathered together the 23 original cases which triggered the review. The final report will conclude their years-long fight for justice. “Up until the inquiry, we still thought we had just had bad luck. So thank goodness for Kayleigh and Rhiannon,” said Cheshire. “In all of the years following, every single time the numbers have gone up, as they have exponentially, it’s been a shock. You just think blimey, can it get any worse? And all those emotions and shock have been spread over so many years.” Cheshire now lives in Newport, Shropshire, with 11-year-old Adam, who is hearing impaired, visually impaired, asthmatic, autistic and has learning difficulties. He requires 24/7 supervision and will never be able to live independently. “He’s gorgeous, and he’s lovely, and he’s scrummy and he’s my son and I love him to pieces. But it didn’t have to be this way,” she said. “Of course I don’t believe that disability in and of itself is some kind of tragedy. But this was a situation that could have been very different if the hospital had noticed what was going on.” She believes that staff let her down by not warning her of the risks when her waters broke and labour didn’t start for more than 18 hours, during which time she passed on the GBS infection to her son. She also felt they failed to act quick enough when Adam didn’t feed overnight, was crying with a high-pitched cry and was grunting. “By the time I was awake and saying there are issues, they were still dismissive until it was nearly too late,” she said. “The signs were there and as medical professionals they should have known.” For Cheshire, and many of the families affected by the Shrewsbury maternity scandal, their main priority is ensuring the report brings lasting change. “I’m not particularly interested in blaming anyone,” said Cheshire. “What I’m interested in is: how can we stop this happening in the future? We’ve got the skills, we’ve got the technology, we’ve got the medicine for things to be, maybe not perfect, but a lot safer than they were in Shrewsbury. How can we protect families from this heartbreak?”",News/Society,Shropshire baby deaths report: parents express relief and anger,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/shropshire-baby-deaths-report-parents-express-relief-and-anger
3/30/2022,"Northern Ireland is coming to an end, and unionists, having nowadays only themselves to blame, are plummeting through history, desperately seeking the security of the homeland they are convinced their forefathers built for them. There will be elections to the Stormont assembly in Belfast on 5 May, but it looks as if the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), currently the largest unionist party, will refuse to return. Sinn Féin looks set to come in as the largest party, thereby winning the first minister’s role. Up to now this has always been held by a unionist. The DUP has said this is “a problem”. Fifty years ago, on 28 March 1972, the British government, realising that unionism was incapable of handling the requirement to change by giving civil rights to nationalists, shut down the Northern Irish parliament and imposed direct rule. Brian Faulkner, the last of the province’s unionist prime ministers, declared it a betrayal. Tens of thousands of loyalists rallied in protest in front of Edward Carson’s statue outside Parliament Buildings at Stormont. In 1974 the Sunningdale Agreement, an attempt to set up a new regime with participation by nationalists, was thwarted when unionists and loyalist paramilitaries joined forces to stage a massive strike that brought Northern Ireland to a standstill. Direct rule continued for the rest of the years of the Troubles, only ending when the Good Friday agreement was signed in 1998. The problem in 1972 was the refusal to share power, and recognising the rights of Irish citizens in NI, and the problem today is the same. Even though the arrangements at Stormont are founded on a mandatory powersharing coalition and the first and deputy first ministers are actually joint and equal, the DUP has been pretending to itself and to its gullible voters that because the first minister’s office has always been held by a unionist, Northern Ireland essentially still had a unionist prime minister. And that it was therefore still in charge of its beloved wee country with the right to say “no”, over and over. A rude awakening is coming and panic has set in. And so it is that Jeffrey Donaldson MP, the DUP leader, and, reluctantly, one of its candidates as an MLA, finds himself sitting miserably on lorry-pulled trailers at poorly attended anti-protocol rallies in the main streets of small towns in unionist heartlands. He has his Orange sash with him, lest anyone doubt his loyalty – and plenty do, for paranoia is the prevailing condition at these events. The Orange order is once again trying to unite the unionist family. What is being opposed is not just the protocol - it is the Good Friday agreement. Alongside Donaldson are people who, having nothing constructive to offer to politics, seek to make up for it with breast-beating sectarian rhetoric which portrays unionists as the most betrayed and victimised people in the world. Ever. The Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister (his party’s sole MLA) claims Northern Ireland has been colonised by the EU and is coveted by the Republic of Ireland. A senior DUP politician told one rally that if the government could stand up for Ukraine, it could stand up for the union. This was expanded by a hyperbolic blogger who explained that while Ukraine was under siege from Russia, Northern Ireland was “[in the] UK, subjugated by the protocol & is under an EU jackboot”. There are warnings about foreigners and enemies – including journalists and the judiciary. Apart from Kate Hoey, for whom no one in Northern Ireland ever cast a vote, they are all men. Manliness is next to godliness when it comes to saving Ulster. Allister sneerily equates the prospect of unionism taking the deputy first minister’s role with becoming the “bridemaid” of Sinn Féin. The DUP was disappointed by Westminster’s reaction when it crashed the executive at Stormont earlier this year. The government hardly registered the big move, and there was the usual scramble for the exits when MP Ian Paisley Jr got up to lament the ingratitude of the prime minister to his most loyal subjects. This week the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, said checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea must continue. Unionists love to call for the “triggering” of article 16. Lewis pointed out that this would not in any case mean scrapping the protocol. In the last days of what may be the last Northern Irish assembly for the foreseeable future, bills that had already been progressed were voted through. They included one to offer women further protections from domestic violence, one to stop anti-abortionists from harassing women outside health clinics, and one to give more parents the ability to choose integrated education for their children. The DUP attempted to stop most of them. No wonder many of those who used to vote unionist are now looking elsewhere, or not voting at all. Last week, while Prince Charles and Camilla were learning Irish dancing in the Irish Republic during a congenial tour, gunmen forced a man to drive a hoax bomb to a venue at which an Irish government minister was speaking. Nationalist politicians have been intimidated, their election posters set on fire. After Ulster Unionist party leader Doug Beattie spoke out against incendiary rhetoric at anti-protocol rallies, the window of his constituency office was smashed. Thuggery. There are those with a nostalgia for violence who like to hint that the paramilitaries will rise again and save the province. They won’t. They do not have the capacity and the people do not want them. Northern Ireland never worked for all of its people. Unionism has seen to it that it never will.

3/30/2022,"A damning report into hundreds of baby deaths has condemned the trust at the centre of the biggest maternity scandal in the history of the NHS for blaming mothers while repeatedly ignoring its own catastrophic blunders for decades. The independent inquiry into maternity practices at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust uncovered hundreds of cases in which health officials failed to undertake serious incident investigations, while deaths were dismissed or not investigated appropriately. Instead, grieving families were denied access to reviews of their care and mothers were blamed when their babies died or suffered horrific injuries. A combination of an obsession with natural births over caesarean sections coupled with a shocking lack of staff, training and oversight of maternity wards resulted in a toxic culture in which mothers and babies died needlessly for 20 years while “repeated failures” were ignored again and again. Tragically, it meant some babies were stillborn, dying shortly after birth or being left severely brain damaged, while others suffered horrendous skull fractures or avoidable broken bones. Some babies developed cerebral palsy after traumatic forceps deliveries, while others were starved of oxygen and experienced life-changing brain injuries. The report, led by the maternity expert Donna Ockenden, examined cases involving 1,486 families between 2000 and 2019, and reviewed 1,592 clinical incidents. “Throughout our final report we have highlighted how failures in care were repeated from one incident to the next,” she said. “For example, ineffective monitoring of foetal growth and a culture of reluctance to perform caesarean sections resulted in many babies dying during birth or shortly after their birth. “In many cases, mother and babies were left with lifelong conditions as a result of their care and treatment. The reasons for these failures are clear. There were not enough staff, there was a lack of ongoing training, there was a lack of effective investigation and governance at the trust and a culture of not listening to the families involved. “There was a tendency of the trust to blame mothers for their poor outcomes, in some cases even for their own deaths. What is astounding is that for more than two decades these issues have not been challenged internally and the trust was not held to account by external bodies. “This highlights that systemic change is needed locally, and nationally, to ensure that care provided to families is always professional and compassionate, and that teams from ward to board are aware of and accountable for the values and standards that they should be upholding. Going forward, there can be no excuses.” The inquiry was ordered by Jeremy Hunt in 2017 when he was health secretary. On Wednesday, he said the numbers were “worse” than he could have imagined and he hoped the report would be “a wake-up call”. Ockenden’s team of investigators found families were locked out of reviews into deaths and were mistreated by callous maternity staff. The trust, which is now ranked inadequate, repeatedly failed to adequately monitor baby’s heart rates, with catastrophic results, alongside not using drugs properly in labour. Trust leaders and midwives also pursued a lethal strategy of deliberately keeping caesarean section rates low, despite the fact this repeatedly had severe consequences. Richard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies, who have campaigned for years over the poor care they experienced, lost their daughter Kate within hours of her birth in March 2009. The trust described it as a “no harm” event, but an inquest jury later ruled Kate’s death could have been avoided. The trust continued to insist its care had been in line with national guidelines. A second couple who have led the campaign for safer care at Shrewsbury are Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 from a Group B strep infection. A year later, a coroner ruled her death could have been avoided. A criminal investigation into the trust is being carried out by West Mercia police. Ockenden identified nine areas – and 60 actions – for learning and improvement at the trust, including management of patient safety, patient and family involvement in care and investigations, complaints processes, and staffing. In addition, 15 “immediate and essential actions” for all maternity services in England are put forward, covering 10 key areas, including that NHS England must commit to a long-term investment plan to ensure the “provision of a well-staffed workforce”. The report says appropriate, minimum staffing levels must be agreed nationally and locally, and adhered to, while there should be a clear escalation policy when staffing levels are not met. Health leaders told the Guardian this week they fear a national shortage of more than 2,000 midwives means women and babies will remain at risk of unsafe care in the NHS. “A death of a mother or baby, or a birth incident which results in an injury should never be ignored,” said Ockenden. “There should never again be a review of this scale, in both numbers, and the length of years across which these concerns remained hidden.”",News/Society,Baby deaths inquiry: Shrewsbury NHS trust condemned for ‘repeated failures’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/baby-deaths-inquiry-shrewsbury-nhs-trust-condemned-for-repeated-failures
3/30/2022,"Thousands of graduate student workers around the US at private and public universities have gone on strike over the past few years, from Ivy League institutions like Harvard University and Columbia University to public state universities in California. Graduate workers at even more colleges have organized unions in spite of staunch opposition from their administrations. Among the most pressing unifying themes among graduate student workers organizing unions and holding protest actions and strikes is the low pay, an issue plaguing graduate student workers around the US. In the US, graduate workers take on jobs such as helping teach courses, assisting with research projects and performing often vital clerical tasks that help run academic institutions. In Indiana, graduate workers at Indiana University Bloomington are currently considering a strike over their university’s refusal to negotiate with their union over ending fees charged to graduate workers and paying them a living wage. Zara Anwarzai, a PhD candidate in philosophy and cognitive science at Indiana University Bloomington for four years, receives about $20,000 a year in pay from the university, and barely makes ends meet without working a side job, even as she shares a tiny one-bedroom apartment with her partner, who is also a graduate worker. “It’s often the case that we pay our monthly bills late so that we can make it until the next check,” said Anwarzai. She has struggled with chronic back pain and can’t afford the physical therapy her doctor has recommended for it. She’s often delayed filling prescription medications because she couldn’t afford the copay for it. When taking on side jobs either within or outside the university, she’s worked as much as nearly 18 hours with few breaks. “We have to stop spreading the ‘I get paid to study!’ narrative of graduate school,” added Anwarzai. “As you go through a program, you realize to what extent your work in your departments and the university have benefited them. They need your labor as a teacher and researcher, they need you as someone who takes on unpaid service roles, and they need your academic and professional reputation.” For international students, they legally cannot work additional jobs while working as a graduate student worker. Simon Luo, a PhD candidate in political science at Indiana University Bloomington and international graduate worker, is paid just $19,000 a year. “This is thousands of dollars below the minimum living wage in Bloomington, Indiana. I’m constantly unable to make ends meet,” said Luo. “Not being able to support myself financially means constantly confronting the financial anxiety brought by low income.” Salaries for graduate student workers vary widely around the US. In January 2022, Princeton University announced raises for graduate worker stipends of 25% to about $40,000 annually and Brown University recently raised base annual stipends to over $42,000 annually, while many colleges and universities pay stipends of far less than $20,000 annually. Pay can often vary for graduate student workers depending on academic departments and alternative sources of funding and grants. This pay has remained low at universities and colleges around the US, despite university endowments soaring in 2021, with an average return of nearly 31%, the highest average returns since 1983. About 19% of colleges and universities that reported endowment returns in 2021 had endowments worth more than $1bn each. At the University at Buffalo in New York, pay for some graduate workers can be as low as $10,500 annually, noted Lawrence Mullen, a PhD student worker in the English department at the University at Buffalo and president of UB graduate student employees union. She cited an internal survey of graduate workers at UB conducted by the union, which found around 20% of graduate workers at the school were making less than $15,000 annually. “They are paying our graduate graduate workers less than a living wage and in some cases, a third of what is the living wage in Erie county, which, according to the Economic Policy Institute, is about $35,000,” said Mullen. “At UB, we have a food bank, and last semester, fall 2021, 80% of the people who used that food bank were graduate students.” At Stony Brook University in New York, graduate workers are currently organizing a living wage campaign to demand pay increases for graduate workers, with current base stipends set at $22,500 annually. The union also reported survey findings of graduate student workers reporting issues in affording rent and the ongoing financial stress induced by low pay with the high cost of living in Suffolk county, New York. “The teachers and the instructors of these courses are having a difficult time just getting by. Racking up credit card debt, not being able to repair their car, selling blood plasma, picking up side jobs, doing sex work on the side, just for the purpose of supporting themselves,” said John Klecker, a graduate student worker in chemistry at Stony Brook. Low pay is emerging as a more pressing issue for graduate workers who often live in cities with high costs of living, which are currently soaring with soaring rents and spikes in the prices of basic necessities. Preston Stone, a graduate worker in the English department at the University of Miami, makes about $24,000 a year. Despite working through summers, he doesn’t receive any pay for three months between spring and fall semesters. “Many people, because of the increase in rent without increasing stipends, have decided to not continue graduate studies. They’ve decided to go back home or transfer to a different university,” said Stone. At the University of Florida, graduate workers’ starting pay is about $19,000 annually for nine months out of the year, though individuals require an income of at least $32,200 annually to afford a studio apartment in the area in 2021. A survey conducted by UF Graduate Assistants United of more than 1,000 graduate workers at UF found significant proportions of graduate workers struggling to make ends meet, relying on local food banks, and unable to afford medical care on the pay from the university. The union is currently pushing for significant wage increases in new union contract negotiations with the University of Florida, as the school has an endowment of more than $2.2bn and received $861m in research awards in 2021, research in which graduate workers are heavily involved. “Graduate students’ work is the pillar upon which research projects are built. These are the very same projects that brought almost $900m in funding and for which the University of Florida makes prideful statements on social media. Yet at the same time, the university publicly rejected the union’s bargaining package, on the grounds of being unable to find the money to pay graduate students a living wage,” said Konstantina Sokratous an international graduate student worker in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Florida. “These universities make a lot of profit off of graduate students, while being apathetic about the fact that these human beings struggle to feed themselves every single day,” she said.",News/US news,US graduate students protest against low pay while universities profit from their work,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/us-graduate-students-protest-against-low-pay-while-universities-profit-from-their-work
3/30/2022,"Three years ago, Ricardo Capuano, 32, didn’t know how much a gram of marijuana cost. Now, after years of lockdown and an extended period of overwhelming anxiety, he has become something of a weed connoisseur. Capuano was never a stoner; sure, he dabbled in high school, but beer and mezcal were always his “weapon of choice”. It wasn’t until the summer of 2020, in the pits of Covid despair, that he found himself reformed as a proud, regular toker. In fact, Capuano found himself actually proselytizing about the splendor of cannabis to his friends during their weekly online poker games. “I was starting to become an advocate,” he laughs. “I didn’t have to interact with that many people,” continues Capuano, who recently became engaged to his girlfriend of five years and moved from Mexico City to Houston to facilitate a career pivot. “I was cooking and doing dishes, I was sitting and waiting for time to pass. Weed is enjoyable when you’re doing those activities.” “We didn’t see my parents or my friends,” he adds, “but we did see our dealer quite often.” The Covid-19 nightmare sparked a number of shake-ups to the social order – a burgeoning anti-work movement, a sharp economic swoon, and tiresome new polarities in the culture war. But as lockdown orders marched on, many weed agnostics dived in to the community with gusto, forming a new cohort of pandemic-era stoners. According to the data analytics firm Headset, legal marijuana sales increased by 120% in 2020, and 61% in 2021, and Fortune reported that Americans bought $18bn worth of cannabis in our first coronavirus year, $7bn more compared with 2019 transactional figures. There are multiple factors at play here: cannabis is increasingly accessible, with 37 states that have medical marijuana laws on the books in addition to 18 states that allow recreational use. The trend also coincides with a gradual de-stigmatization of the drug in the general populace. But clearly, something about the Covid experience sparked a cannabis renaissance in previously weed-neutral households. Overnight, in quarantined dwellings across the land, it seemed that many people were lighting up. “Covid upended people’s social habits. There were these surveys that college students were smoking more and drinking less. Since we don’t have sanctioned places built for public consumption of marijuana, it’s something that people often do in the house,” says Katharine Neill Harris, a professor who studies drug policy at Rice University. “I’ve also seen some surveys that use has gone up in correlation with reported mental health issues. People are using it as a self-medicating thing. Those are some of the trends that we’re seeing.” Harris notes that there are a lot of different ways to consume cannabis in 2022. The stoner’s toolbox – bongs, pipes, rolling papers – have been made ancillary in Canada or states like Colorado and California, where a sealed pack of THC gummies can be bought in broad daylight, over the counter. Harris speculates that edibles may have served as an easy entry point for the fresh pandemic stoners, which is certainly true for a 35-year-old in Toronto named Andrew Evans. He tells me that he had spent maybe $10 total on weed in his life before Covid, but now says a minor dosage has become a near-daily sacrament. The legalization efforts north of the border sanded away any apprehensions Evans had about having a bad experience; he always knew he was getting whatever was printed on the labels, which offered far more chemical transparency than a mysterious tray of homemade weed brownies. We all spent lockdown willing to try anything – anything – to feel better. What’s a better time to experiment? “I started dabbling with low doses, found I liked how it turned down the volume knob on my bad brain, and ramped up from there. By Christmas, I was absolutely a weed person, as I started pushing gummies on my 60-something parents,” he says. “Weed has significantly improved my quality of life, in a remarkably short period of time. Mentally and physically, I’m in a way better place, aside from a marked increase in chip consumption.” Evans says he drinks much less than he did before the pandemic, which he believes is both a symptom of extended isolation and the acute afternoon-destroying hangovers that heavy drinkers forced to contend with in their 30s and beyond. “Eventually the charm of drinking three local IPAs and falling asleep watching Superstore just wore off,” he says. Evans’ observation bears truth in the data; an increasing number of people are abstaining from alcohol, which Meg Bernhard, a 38-year-old civil engineer and mother of three in Austin, believes is a rebound effect from early-pandemic debauchery. “I think a lot of people started drinking more [during isolation] and then perhaps tried to balance that with weed for health reasons,” she says. Bernhard also became a daily smoker after Covid struck the country. “I feel it helps me engage with the kids when I’m tired. Play games, watch kid movies, and so on.” Nobody knows if the pandemic stoners will keep up the habit as the world mercifully starts to turn on its axis again. Amid all these readily available vaccines, and a hopeful respite from the Omicron wave, it is no longer taboo for Ricardo Capuano to book a long, wine-soaked dinner with friends. This is a tenuous reality – we’ve all learned to never underestimate Covid – but Capuano says that he no longer needs a drug to help him cope, and therefore, a newly minted weed adherent is already trying to cut down on a pattern he picked up in lockdown. “In the same way I found out that I wasn’t really drinking, I found out that I was smoking every day. I’m no longer sitting on my ass, waiting for this to be over. I need to get on with my life,” he says. “I still smoke, but now I reserve it for special occasions. And what’s a special occasion? Well, that’s open for interpretation.”",News/US news,How the pandemic created a new generation of stoners,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/pandemic-marijuana-use-increase-covid
3/30/2022,"Kevin Booker fell into hypermiling. Or perhaps he coasted gently downhill into it, hypermiling being the art of driving in a way to maximise fuel efficiency. Anyway, he’s an accidental hypermiler; it started as something to relieve the boredom of the daily 70-mile commute, from Swansea to Brecon, where he works for National Parks. “It was almost a way to gamify it, to get the fuel I was using to go further,” the 44-year-old tells me. “I was learning the techniques to get the most out of that gallon.” We’ll come to the techniques. It was a useful game. “The bonus was I was saving money. Over a month, I could save up to £50 without really increasing my journey time.” This was back in 2003, when a litre of petrol or diesel (Booker drove a diesel Vauxhall Corsa in those days) cost less than a pound. You know what’s happened to fuel prices since, and recently they have put their right foot to the floor to go up the steepest of hills. Even with Rishi Sunak’s 5p duty cut last week, you’re still looking at about £1.60 for unleaded and more than £1.70 for diesel. I had my first £80 forecourt shock the other day. Used Skoda Fabia, since you ask – I know, nice wheels, right? But back to Booker’s own hypermiling journey: after finding out he was good at it, Booker came across an advert in a car magazine for an event called the MPG Marathon, a test of fuel economy under on-road conditions. With his wife Terri’s encouragement, he entered. “It was around rural Essex, they give you a time you have to complete the course in, so you’re not going too slow and causing obstructions. They don’t want you going down the motorway at 25mph.” Driving a diesel Honda Civic (“In those days you could get 100 miles to the gallon from a carefully driven diesel”), he came second, but would later team up with the man (hypermilers tend to be men) who beat him and they would go on to break records together. Booker got the bug, big time. He became a regular at the MPG Marathon, and through that, another event called the Layer Marney Cup, also in Essex. “These things seem to take place in Essex, I don’t know what it is about the county.” Not too many hills maybe. He’s won the Layer Marney Cup a couple of times. Did it become a kind of obsession? “Most cars have a range meter now, telling you how many miles you have left. You do find you try to go further than the car thinks it can go on the fuel you’ve got.” I recognise that, I do it, try to beat the range meter. Whereas once it might have been trying to get there before the satnav says you’re going to, now it’s about using less fuel. In the competitive – and again, almost certainly male – numbers game, range is the new speed. Anyway, with soaring costs, what was quite niche – a few range enthusiasts such as Booker driving slowly and smoothly around Essex – has gone mainstream. And it’s not just better for the pocket but also the planet; maybe not quite win-win, but at least lose-less. Everyone should be a hypermiler now. So, come on Booker, let’s be having your tips. This is his big one. “Read the road ahead for traffic lights and roundabouts, so you always keep moving. If there’s a green light a fair distance off, there’s a high probability it will be red by the time you get to it. It’s all about pacing, so you get there when it’s green. With roundabouts, feed into them rather than stop.” Booker is not a fan of stopping. No harsh accelerating or braking. “In a conventional fuelled car, every time you use the brakes you are wasting that energy. Hybrids and EVs have regenerative braking – 70% of the energy goes back into the battery, so it’s not so much of an issue.” Otherwise the techniques for hypermiling in an EV are the same, keep it all smooth and flowing. It won’t make much difference to your journey time – but driving as slowly as is reasonable, and in the highest possible gear without labouring your engine – will be cheaper. And change up earlier: “Don’t hold the gears in high revs, it’s about getting a feel for the right time to change.” On the motorway, keep with the flow of the traffic. Don’t indulge that inner racer. Booker says he’s a calm driver. “I’m not one of those people who gets worked up and is overtaking like mad. I’m not a road-rage person.” The car that is, with regular servicing. Booker could tell when they put the wrong grade oil in his Toyota Aygo once, “just by the feel of it”. I think that’s quite advanced hypermiling, but you can check your tyre pressures, and make sure they’re in good condition. Cheap tyres can be a false economy. “You find people driving around with a boot full of junk. Reduce the weight of your car by getting rid of things you don’t need.” Booker didn’t include children in this. Reduce drag too – lose the roof box when you’re not using it. At motorway speeds, open windows create drag, so it’s better to have the windows closed and the aircon on. SUVs don’t make for good hypermilers. “Manufacturers are guilty of pushing people towards big SUVs. Do you actually need one? A saloon or an estate is more efficient because it is a more aerodynamic shape.” Go electric, in other words. Terri did, swapping to a Renault Zoe, in 2015. Booker followed, in her slipstream (not too close, that’s dangerous). He now drives a Hyundai Ioniq. Electricity prices are skyrocketing too of course, but as well as being cleaner and greener, EVs are still cheaper to run. You’ll notice EV drivers looking especially smug at the moment. Booker has worked out the electricity for his round trip to work now costs 97p. And if you’re anxious about EV range, get this: last year, Booker, with a couple of his hypermiler pals, drove an electric car from John o’Groats to Land’s End with just one recharging stop. He’s in the Guinness World Records for it. That’s seriously impressive, an elite hypermiler hypermiling at the very top of his game; the average driver won’t get that. We did want to get an electric car, but they were too expensive and we don’t have off-street parking to charge it. Hence the Fabia. But from now on, with Kevin’s tips, it’s only going to be hypermiling. It’s either that or the Megabus.",News/Environment,Beat the petrol price hike!

3/30/2022,"In a makeshift hut by the ministry of justice in La Paz, Bolivia, a group of activists shuffle into place for a meeting. They are the survivors of the dictatorships that ruled Bolivia between 1964 and 1982; most are now in their 70s or 80s. In 2012, fearing the country was moving on without a reckoning, they built the hut and moved in: a permanent protest to demand justice for the crimes committed against them. Ten years later, they’re still there. Almost 50 of them have died since the protest began, and many of the rest are old and ailing. Yet their demands seem no closer to being met. Operation Condor, the state terror network that targeted opponents of South America’s military dictatorships, is better known for its actions in Argentina and Chile. But it was present in Bolivia, too, where more than 200 people were murdered and 150 forcibly disappeared. After its dictatorships, Bolivia had little transitional justice. When Evo Morales and the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) came to power in 2006, many victims believed the time had come, but ultimately, little changed: the military archives remained closed, and the government offered only partial reparations to the estimated 6,000 victims. And so, on 13 March 2012, the activists began their live-in protest. “We all supported it, we all agreed,” said Victoria López, who leads the activists today. “But we never thought it would last so many years, that it would entail so much suffering.” Inside the hut, there is a meeting room, with a kitchen to one side and a bedroom to the other. It is on one of the busiest streets in the city, and the noise is relentless. At an altitude of almost 4,000m, it gets bitterly cold at night. In 10 years it has never been empty. Once a week, the activists gather to plan their next move. They are onetime politicians and union leaders, as well as teachers, miners and campesinos. The youngest are in their 60s, the oldest approaching 100. In 2017, after five years in the hut, the activists achieved one of their goals: a truth commission. Five investigators were chosen, among them Nila Heredia, a former MAS politician and member of ASOFAMD, an association for families of the disappeared. Heredia said that the commission lacked time and resources, but it did have access to military archives. Their report was handed to the government in March 2021. It has not been published online, but Heredia said it recommended reparations for the victims and their families – though not necessarily economic reparations. The government is yet to act on the report. The activists have become sceptical about the commission. They believe that the report maintains impunity and offers no real advance on emblematic cases, such as that of socialist leader Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz, one of the many whose bodies were never found. Another emblematic case is that of Juan Carlos Flores Bedregal, who at 27 years old was Bolivia’s youngest ever parliamentarian when he disappeared in 1980. His family, having exhausted the legal options in Bolivia, have taken the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. “Every country has created its own transitional mechanisms, some with more success than others,” said Karinna Fernández, the lawyer representing the family. “But from our assessment, without a doubt, the country that has the greatest debt with its victims is Bolivia.” Mark Goodale, an anthropologist who interviewed the activists, believes this neglect stems from the change that took place in the Bolivian left with the election of Morales in 2006. While the MAS is mostly centred around Indigenous politics, he says, the activists represent a traditional revolutionary left that is out of favour. “They are relics of an ideological past which doesn’t exist anymore.” Fernández offers an alternative explanation. As a lawyer, she has dealt with various Bolivian governments – not just the MAS – and found no difference between them. “Why is it that they all have the same response of denials when it comes to forced disappearances? In my opinion, it reflects the influence of the armed forces.” For Heredia, though, it is just a matter of priorities. “As it was not urgent, or more urgent, like the economic, social and development matters, we took too long to get to it.” Yet the urgency is felt in the hut, where there is a banner with the number of years, months and days the protest has lasted – and a list with the name of each activist that has died in that time. “We are what remains of those that stood up to the dictators,” said López. “We won democracy for our country. And today we are forgotten.” There is no national campaign for them, said Goodale, nor is it something that gets into the news. The protest has gone on so long, it has become invisible. “And at some point, there won’t be any survivors left. Then it will fade away.”",News/Global development,Bolivian victims of dictatorships still waiting for justice: ‘We are forgotten’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/30/bolivian-victims-dictatorships-still-wait-for-justice
3/30/2022,"A coalition of unions, environmentalists and human rights groups have called for the New South Wales parliament to halt a hastily drafted bill that would see protesters who block major roads, ports or train stations face up to two years in prison. The attorney general Mark Speakman on Wednesday afternoon introduced legislation into the NSW parliament to dramatically increase penalties for people who cause “damage or disruption” on major roads or other transport assets across the state. First flagged last week, the bill was introduced on Wednesday in response to a series of climate protests that disrupted Port Botany in recent weeks. The bill introduces fines of up to $22,000 and jail time of up to two years for anyone who “enters, remains on, climbs, jumps from or otherwise trespasses” major roads in the state and “seriously disrupts or obstructs vehicles or pedestrians”. The same punishment would also apply to anyone who “trespasses on or blocks entry to any part” of a major facility, including Port Botany, the Port of Newcastle or public transport assets such as train stations. The government was seeking to rush the bill through the parliament’s lower house on Wednesday despite immediate alarm from unions and human rights organisations. Just hours after the government flagged the introduction of the bill, the head of Unions NSW called for the parliament to “pause and reconsider” because, he said, it risked criminalising industrial campaigns. “As the law is currently drafted any nurse, paramedic or truck driver who sits down on Macquarie Street to campaign for their rights at work faces two years of gaol,” Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey said. “That is unacceptable. Parliament needs to pause and reconsider the laws.” The bill also prompted 39 environmentalist and human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, the Aboriginal Legal Service and the Australian Council of Social Service, to send an open letter calling for the legislation to be blocked. “Protest marchers on city roads and union groups taking action at industrial sites could come under the umbrella of these draconian laws,” the letter stated. “Everyone from school kids marching for climate action to anti-war protesters would run the risk of incurring these penalties when they set out on a march. “Such laws are incompatible with the democratic right to protest and our fundamental civil liberties.” While the bill flagged on Wednesday does not mention protest activity, the legislation is aimed at climate protesters who have caused disruptions across Sydney, including repeated blockades of Port Botany and the Spit Bridge in the city’s north. A one-page briefing distributed to MPs on Wednesday afternoon said the penalties would apply to people who “participate in illegal protests” and specifically mentions those actions. The government’s briefing claims those actions are likely to have cost the economy “millions of dollars through direct economic loss and lost productivity”. The government plans to push the legislation through the lower house on today after Labor said it would support the bill with amendments to carve out industrial action. The Greens have also signalled they will seek to obstruct the bill’s passage on Wednesday night by moving a series of amendments. Jamie Parker, the party’s MP for Balmain, said attempt to rush the bill through parliament was “the opposite of how good laws are made”. “The government did nothing when there were thousands of right-wing anti-lockdown protesters blocking the streets during lockdown. It’s only when climate activists take action that the government says we need draconian laws to stop them,” Parker said. “The government is planning to force a vote on this bill just hours after it was introduced. There’s barely been enough time for members to read it let alone consult with stakeholders or have a proper debate in the parliament. “The government doesn’t have a clear majority so they wouldn’t be ramming this through unless they knew that they have the overall support of the Labor Party.” Last week, the government introduced similar penalties covering people who blockade tunnels and bridges. Those changes did not need legislation to introduce because the government was able to expand an existing regulation covering the Harbour Bridge. But the changes failed to discourage activists from climate group Blockade Australia. Nine of its members were arrested over five days last week as it conducted a series of protests seeking to disrupt Port Botany. Other protesters from the group Fireproof Australia have recently caused traffic havoc after blockading Manly’s Spit Bridge during peak hour.",News/Australia news,NSW government urged to halt new bill targeting road-blocking protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/nsw-government-urged-to-halt-new-bill-targeting-road-blocking-protesters
3/30/2022,"A rap about food shortages has become a hit in Shanghai, with the artists behind the song describing it as an attempt to “cheer up” tens of millions of residents locked down in China’s largest city amid a surging Covid outbreak and increasing restrictions. The song, Grocery Shopping, laments empty shelves and fights in the supermarket aisles, and is set to footage of residents crowding around market stalls, or lining up for PCR tests. “Set your alarm, wake up, food fight,” the lyrics say. “Order that tofu, but the sauce all gone.” The song’s release comes as Shanghai authorities expanded some lockdown measures and the city reported record daily case numbers in an outbreak city-wide frustrations. China is in the midst of its worst outbreak of the pandemic, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Shanghai is recording the bulk of cases, with the city’s outbreak yet to peak. It reported 5,656 asymptomatic cases and 326 symptomatic cases for Tuesday, up from 4,381 new asymptomatic cases and 96 new cases with symptoms for the prior day. In response the city has been divided in two, with four day lockdowns and mass testing drives beginning on Monday for one half, and Friday for the other. However late on Tuesday, authorities announced lockdown measures in some areas of the currently free section. The south-west district of Minhang announced public transportation would be suspended until 5 April, and residents in some western districts received notice from their housing committees that they would be stopped from leaving their compounds for the next seven days. “We express our deepest thanks to all residents! We will resume normal life soon, but in the next period of time we ask everyone to adhere closely to pandemic control measures, do not gather, and reduce movements,” said one notice seen by Reuters. Social media messages also circulated that areas of Puxi would be locked down from Wednesday, a claim dismissed by authorities as “rumour”. For weeks Shanghai authorities were vociferously rejecting rumours there were plans for lockdowns, arresting at least two people for spreading wrong information. Then on Sunday, plans sharply reversed with the announcement of split lockdowns for the city of 26 million people. Shanghai residents have expressed growing frustration with the measures imposed on the city, particularly food shortages in supermarkets. Residents have reported rising costs for fresh produce, with jokes in groupchats about the empty supermarket shelves soon forcing them to eat the community shrubbery. Elderly people have reported struggling with the technology required for online ordering. Amid the restrictions and shortages the rap, released on Monday by artists named CATI2, PJ, and Keyso, has become a hit in the city. The Shanghai lyricists sing about food fights, people waking up early to order food only to find ingredients sold out and delivery drivers all busy. In another section PJ describes escaping one lockdown to get trapped in another. “Thinking it was an excellent idea to use music to cheer up the people of Shanghai and dispel the negative atmosphere online, the three of us got started immediately,” PJ told Sixth Tone. “We chose buying vegetables as the theme, because it is the challenge that sums this outbreak up the most. I’ve been to the supermarket to stock up on food many times, and each time I saw people pick the shelves clean. It was even worse than when they buy up groceries before New Year.” There is growing discontent with China’s zero-Covid policies and the subsequent lockdowns across cities and provinces as Omicron challenges China’s usual methods of containing outbreaks. Coupled with the fear among officials of punishment for failures, harsh and hasty measures have in some cases proved distressing, even fatal. In a repeat of January’s lockdown in Xi’an, where at least one man died and a woman miscarried after they were denied entry to hospital, refusal of medical care is again causing concern in Shanghai. Media reports have described dialysis patients – who receive life-preserving treatment about three times a week – denied entry to multiple hospitals. Last week a nurse in Shanghai died after she was denied entry to hospitals after suffering an asthma attack. Such refusals go against government policy, which has only requested hospitals suspend general outpatient services.
