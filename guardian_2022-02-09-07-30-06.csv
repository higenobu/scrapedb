2/9/2022,"Adele was the runaway winner at this year’s female-dominated Brit awards, taking home the prizes for artist of the year, album of the year for her fourth record, 30, and British song of the year for its lead single, Easy on Me. “I can’t believe that a piano ballad won against that many bangers,” she said when collecting the single award, her first prize of the night. It brings her Brit awards haul to a total of 12, and reflects her predictable yet still staggering commercial successes in recent months. Her album 30 became the biggest-seller of 2021 after just six weeks on sale, and was heralded with reviving the CD as well as causing backlogs in vinyl production plants.  She dedicated the award for album of the year to her son, Angelo, and her ex-husband, Simon Konecki. “This album was all of our journey, not just mine, and I’m very proud of myself for sticking to my guns and putting out an album that was so personal to me – ‘cause not many people do that any more. My son has been so kind and gracious and patient with me over the years.” Adele’s wins presumably mark a high point in a bleak few weeks that saw her postpone a much-anticipated Las Vegas residency. However, she was kept from a potential 13th Brit award – which would have equalled Robbie Williams’ record as the most celebrated artist in history – by Dua Lipa, who won the fan-voted prize for best pop/R&B act , Lipa’s fifth Brit. Usually a key fixture of previous Brits ceremonies, Lipa sent a remote acceptance speech from tour rehearsals in Miami. Given the political statements made by artists in recent Brits awards ceremonies, this year’s was curiously devoid of provocation. “Boris, I know you’re watching,” said host Mo Gilligan in the night’s sole reference to the government’s current predicament. “I know you love a party. Come down, man.” Ed Sheeran won none of his four categories, but he was garlanded with a new award, songwriter of the year, voted for by an independent panel, and performed twice. In 2021, in addition to writing his fifth studio album, =, he co-wrote songs for artists including Rita Ora, Maisie Peters, BTS, Anne-Marie and JLS, in addition to collaborations with Elton John, LadBaby, Nigerian singer Fireboy DML, Ghetts and Taylor Swift. In the ceremony’s first year without gendered categories, women and female-fronted acts dominated proceedings, winning 10 out of 15 prizes – defying concerns expressed by culture secretary Nadine Dorries that women would be disfranchised by the BPI’s “sad decision”. Collecting the award for best artist, Adele said: “I understand why they changed the name of this award [from best female/male artist], but I really love being a woman, I really love being a female artist.” The change to the gendered awards came after criticism of the 2021 ceremony by non-binary singer Sam Smith, whose gender identity meant they couldn’t be nominated in the male or female artist awards. They said: “I look forward to a time where awards shows can be reflective of the society we live in.” Beyond Adele, the British categories were completed by two first-time winners. London band Wolf Alice beat Coldplay among others to best group after releasing their acclaimed third album Blue Weekend last year, and independent London rapper Little Simz, AKA Simbiatu Ajikawo, was named best new artist – despite releasing her debut album more than six years ago. “Look at what you done, mum,” Simz said, as she brought her mum up on stage to help her receive the award. “I am living proof that if you work hard at some thing, no matter your background, your race, you can be something extraordinary. This is for all the kids, keep dreaming, keep pushing. I am you, you are me, lessons.” Later in the ceremony, Simz received expletive-laden plaudits from Adele, collecting the award for best artist, which were censored by ITV. Genre categories replaced the old gender categories, with the winners voted for by fans via TikTok – one of many new Brits initiatives to engage younger music fans who may have little affinity with the stalwart ceremony. In addition to Dua Lipa winning best pop/R&B act, North Shields songwriter Sam Fender took home best rock/alternative act after winning the critics’ choice award (since renamed rising star) in 2019. British singer Becky Hill won her first Brit award, for best dance act, and best hip-hop/grime/rap act went to London rapper Dave, who previously won album of the year for his debut, Psychodrama, in 2020. He dedicated his award to “the rappers that have suffered for years and years, and broken down so many barriers in this industry that I’m in right now”, and hailed his Brits peers Little Simz and Ghetts. In the international categories, Billie Eilish continued her winning streak, taking home best artist having previously been named best international female solo artist in 2020 and 2021. “I feel so lucky to be awarded this again, I don’t feel deserving,” she said in a video message. Breakout star Olivia Rodrigo won song of the year for the pop-punk anthem Good 4 U, and newcomers – at least in name – Silk Sonic, AKA Brits old hand Bruno Mars and rapper Anderson .Paak were named best group, beating a diverse category that included Abba, Italian Eurovision winners Måneskin, K-pop megastars BTS and US rock group the War on Drugs. Prior to the ceremony, UK newcomer Holly Humberstone was announced as the recipient of the rising star award – and made her live Brits debut performing her recent single London Is Lonely at the ceremony. Inflo won producer of the year for his work with Adele, Little Simz, and his own mysterious, critically acclaimed collective Sault alongside his partner Cleo Sol, marking the first time a non-white artist has won the award since the inception of the Brits in 1977. “I feel honoured to be a part of change,” Inflo, whose real name is Dean Josiah Cover, said prior to the ceremony. “All the Black producers before me, I’m in awe and have studied you. I am you. Thank you for paving the way and for your integral contribution to British music.” Adele paid tribute to Inflo in her album of the year acceptance speech, calling him “integral” to it. “He really changed my life, not just with my music, but with me as well. Flo, I love you.” Those with multiple nominations who went home empty-handed include UK drill rapper Central Cee and veteran dance producer David Guetta. Little Mix, who are set to go on hiatus following their 2022 tour, also missed out on what might be their final chance at a Brit award, for best British group. In 2021, they became the first all-female act in Brits history to win the best group category. The awards are primarily voted for by the Brits Academy, comprising musicians alongside music industry and media figures. Nominees in the two song of the year categories are determined by UK chart performance, but the winner is picked by the Academy.

2/9/2022,"A California nun will serve a year in prison for stealing $835,000 from an elementary school to support her gambling habit in an emotional case that left Los Angeles families and even the federal judge who handed down the sentence reeling. Mary Margaret Kreuper, 80, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering for stealing the money over the course of 10 years while she was principal at St James Catholic school, had asked the judge not to send her to prison.  “I have sinned, I’ve broken the law and I have no excuses,” Kreuper said via teleconference. “My actions were in violation of my vows, my commandments, the law and, above all, the sacred trust that so many had placed in me. I was wrong and I’m profoundly sorry for the pain and suffering I’ve caused so many people.” Kreuper admitted to diverting money to pay for personal expenses, the US attorney’s office said, including vacations to Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas. In letters sent to the court, the majority of parents and students asked that Kreuper face a lighter sentence, though some asked that she receive the maximum punishment. Otis D Wright II, the US district judge overseeing the case, said he had struggled to determine an appropriate sentence for Kreuper, telling the nun that she had been “one heck of a teacher” and that he couldn’t judge her on “the worst thing that she’s done in her life” alone, the Los Angeles Times reported. Wright, who at one point was so overcome he covered his face in his hands and silently paused, said he took into account the more than 60 years she spent as a nun, her age and lack of criminal history. “I haven’t slept well in God knows how long,” Wright said of his struggles with the case during a Zoom hearing, according to the newspaper. He sentenced Kreuper to a year and a day in prison, rather than the two years prosecutors had requested. Kreuper will also have to pay more than $800,000 in restitution to the school. Wright told Kreuper, who was principal for 28 years, that she had probably had positive impacts on the lives of thousands of students, but also that “this horrible example will affect these kids … You just ran completely off the road,” the Long Beach Press-Telegram reported. Prosecutors said the now retired elementary school principal acknowledged that she embezzled donations, tuition and fees between 2008 and 2018 to pay for personal expenses, including credit card charges and “large gambling expenses incurred at casinos”. St James Catholic school didn’t have enough money for new books and classroom supplies or field trips, prosecutors said, and the money Kreuper stole could have paid for the tuition of 14 students for 10 years. After church officials confronted Kreuper about the theft, she said she believed she deserved a raise and that priests were better paid than nuns, according to the US attorney. Kreuper was addicted to gambling, according to her attorney, and she has been kept under “severe restrictions” at a convent for the last three years, conditions the judge said may be harsher than those she’ll face in federal prison. While some families said her crimes violated their trust and led them to question their faith, others said they forgave Kreuper and that she always put families first. “The church tells us to forgive those who have trespassed against us,” one parent said. “I’ve used this to teach my son that we’re all human, we all make mistakes, but the power of forgiveness is the most powerful tool that we have.” Kreuper wiped away tears during the judge’s remarks and apologized for her crimes. “I was wrong, and I am profoundly sorry for the pain and the suffering that I have caused so many people,” she told the judge.

2/9/2022,"Manchester United are currently in an unwanted surrender mode, this being a second, second-half abdication of responsibility in two matches. It is, patently, not good enough and there is an oddity to elite players of the ilk of Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Raphaël Varane, Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes being unable to kill off an opponent who are last in the standings and who trailed at half-time. Yet, as against Middlesbrough, the plot was lost in the contest’s second 45 minutes. Burnley ended with a precious point that was handed to them by weak defending for the Jay Rodriguez strike that cancelled out Pogba’s opener, and by United’s inability to fire thereafter.  Ralf Rangnick’s team may now have lost only once in nine league games but wins are the demand. United were as bright at the start as they were against Middlesbrough on Friday. Jadon Sancho launched raids on the left and both Pogba and Fernandes scooped balls into Burnley’s area from the same side. Rain swept across the ground on a classic dank night in sight of the Lancashire moors but it did not dampen the visitor’s spark, a Marcus Rashford attempt forcing Nick Pope to make the contest’s opening save and hand United a corner. United struck shortly after, only for the goal to be chalked off. Fernandes floated in a free-kick and up jumped Varane to head home. But no. To Rangnick’s obvious chagrin Mike Dean was ordered to the monitor and ruled that an offside Maguire had impeded Rodriguez and the game remained scoreless. Moments later Rangnick’s mood was dramatically altered after his team gave the best riposte. Fernandes, a firefly flitting around everywhere, appeared at halfway and volleyed a pass out to Rashford on the left. He fed an overlapping Shaw and the left-back’s cross was hammered home by Pogba. This was the France midfielder’s first goal of the season and Burnley were in pieces. United beat Pope again soon – via Ben Mee – but Pogba was adjudged to have fouled Erik Pieters in the buildup so Burnley’s captain and his side escaped. To say Sean Dyche’s side were riding their luck was an understatement. This was underlined when Edinson Cavani failed to score with a point-blank header – his effort allowed Pope to save – that would have made it 2-0. The pattern of United dominance was, once again, reminiscent of the weekend FA Cup tie but the problem then was a second-half implosion ended with Boro knocking them out. By the interval the visitors had taken 12 shots, their hosts zero. Burnley had illustrated why their last win in this competition was in late October, yet they badly required one this evening as victories in their games in hand would lift them from bottom to the safety of 17th. For United, three points would take them to within six of Chelsea in third, the west London club having played two matches more at kick-off. Rangnick, who dropped Cristiano Ronaldo for a first league match under him, could be pleased with the mission so far but now came the second half and the test of not folding as they had last time out. Rangnick would have been wise to remind his charges of this before they wandered out after the break. If he did, they had paid absolutely no heed, as Burnley were all square after 47 minutes. Wout Weghorst’s pivot and pass was as fluid as the slaloming Rodriguez run that took him in on David de Gea, before he coolly slid in the equaliser. Burnley had become rampant, Weghorst firing off a 25-yard laser that had De Gea skidding across the turf to his right to prevent a second within a minute. United were rattled, a second test of spirit coming just four days after their last capitulation. If they failed to emerge with three points after being so utterly in control in the first half, an inquiry into why supposed top-level professionals seem to possess no in-game management would be required. Pogba, Sancho, Cavani and Fernandes all combined in one sequence but the latter misdirected the final ball into Burnley’s area and play broke down. This was United in microcosm since the sides had changed ends. As captain, Harry Maguire was anonymous and his pulling down of Rodriguez when he was the last man was lucky to draw only a yellow card. Rangnick threw on Ronaldo with 22 minutes left, then Jesse Lingard a little later. But after Varane and then the Portuguese missed chances, a mortifying ride home was to be endured at the final whistle.",Sport/Football,Jay Rodriguez delivers Burnley point against wasteful Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/burnley-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report
2/9/2022,"Eddie Howe welcomed five new players to Tyneside last month but as impressively as three of them performed here Newcastle’s manager received a reminder that Allan Saint-Maximin remains the brightest light in his attacking firmament. The French winger’s extraordinary powers of improvisation and incision turned Frank Lampard’s Premier League debut as Everton manager into an uncomfortable night which leaves the Merseysiders on the edge of real relegation trouble.  Thanks not only to Saint-Maximin but excellent performances from Howe’s new full-backs, the outstanding Kieran Trippier and Matt Targett, Newcastle won their third game of the season, hauling themselves out of the bottom three and up to 17th. Ominously for Lampard, Everton sit only one point and one place higher. The nights may be starting to get a little lighter but, whenever Jordan Pickford, touched the ball it felt as if the clock had been turned back to pantomime season. To Newcastle fans, villains do not come bigger than Everton’s former Sunderland goalkeeper and they subjected to him to some pretty relentless high-decibel booing. By way of variety, there were repeated, rather rude, choruses referring to his Wearside heritage but Pickford simply responded by reminding everyone that his kicking is very good indeed. Bar picking the ball out of the back of his net, Lampard’s goalkeeper did not have too much to do during a somewhat scrappy first half low on fancy footwork. If competitiveness and commitment were most certainly not lacking, the game cried out for a couple of central midfielders capable of controlling the tempo and shaping the play. It would have been wonderful to see Lampard roll back the years and show his Everton players precisely how to do it but in the absence of a time capsule capable of transporting him back more than a decade, Everton’s manager at least had his new signings Donny van de Beek and Dele Alli warming the bench. Alli stepped off it in the 25th minute, replacing the injured Demarai Gray but St James’ Park was more excited about the sight of Bruno Guimarães, Howe’s new £35m Brazilian from Lyon, warming up. As the ground echoed to chants of “Bruno, Bruno,” the scoring began, with two own goals registered in swift succession. First Jonjo Shelvey hacked the promisingly inventive Anthony Gordon down, conceding a free-kick. Gordon took it himself and when Alli redirected the ball out back into the box, Mason Holgate’s shot was blocked on the line by Fabian Schär only to end up deflecting in off Jamaal Lascelles. Briefly, Newcastle’s captain looked broken but redemption beckoned. When Joe Willock won a corner, Trippier delivered a defence deceiving dead ball and, although Lascelles’s header hit the bar, it rebounded off Holgate before flying past Pickford. By then Everton had been seriously weakened by an injury to Yerry Mina which saw the key right sided component of Lampard’s back three hobble off. Jarrad Branthwaite trotted on but his lack of experience showed as Chris Wood was allowed a free header. Despite Newcastle’s £25m centre-forward directing it, benignly, straight at Pickford, it was not long before Saint-Maximin crossed with menace. After connecting with that delivery the unmarked Joelinton would surely have scored had the former forward turned left-sided midfielder not got his feet in an awful tangle. Given that Joelinton’s eventual shot somehow ended up hitting him on the head it seems destined to become one of those comedic cameos used to liven up the “what happened next’ segment of televised quiz shows. No matter, Newcastle scored 10 minutes into the new half. Their second goal began with Alli’s forfeiture of possession prefacing another cross from Saint-Maximin and when Michael Keane’s failure to make a headed clearance left Pickford stranded, Ryan Fraser was in the right place at the right time to hook the dropping ball home. As Howe swivelled on his heels, pumped his fists and urged Newcastle fans to “come on” those home supporters yet again had reason to be grateful to Saint-Maximin. The French winger’s adhesive control in the tightest of areas had conjured Fraser’s first goal in a Newcastle shirt and, for all Howe’s £90m-plus January transfer market spend, Saint-Maximin remains the player most integral to his side’s survival chances. By the hour Lampard had been forced to use all three substitutes. Delighted as the “free Donny” campaigners must have been to see Van de Beek finally stripped for action and running onto the pitch as André Gomes’s replacement, the Manchester United loanee could have chosen an easier game in which to make his Everton debut. After so many weeks and months of being unfathomably overlooked by two managers at Old Trafford the Netherlands international was hurled into the deep end of a midfield war zone in which every 50-50 ball was contested with the utmost ferocity. Shortly after Wood correctly had a “goal” disallowed for offside, Fraser created the third for Trippier. When the one time Bournemouth winger’s dribble was rudely interrupted by Allan’s crude lunge, Trippier stepped forward to take the resultant 25-yard free-kick. Howe says he bought the England right back from Atlético Madrid last month as much for his crossing and dead-ball abilities as his defensive qualities. Sure enough Trippier vindicated such judgment by spotting a chink in Everton’s wall and leaving his stellar technique to do the rest. All that remained was for Guimarães to make a rapturously received 89th minute-debut on a night when a toe injury restricted Howe’s fifth January buy, Dan Burn to the bench.",Sport/Football,Kieran Trippier’s stunner for Newcastle leaves Lampard’s Everton in trouble,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/newcastle-everton-premier-league-match-report
2/9/2022,"Eddie Jones says he has “no regrets” about any of his tactical decisions last Saturday and insists that England dominated the Calcutta Cup game in Edinburgh despite Scotland’s 20-17 victory. The head coach is now urging his players to “stay tough” before their Six Nations match in Rome on Sunday and has recalled the fit-again Wasps forward Joe Launchbury and London Irish’s uncapped flanker Tom Pearson to his training squad. There has been no shortage of criticism of England’s collective handling of the final quarter at Murrayfield following the substitution of the fly-half Marcus Smith with the visitors 17-10 ahead. Jones, though, says his side’s poor attacking execution was the primary problem and that George Ford was sent on because “I felt at that stage we needed to change things”.  With Courtney Lawes still recovering from concussion, Manu Tuilagi regaining full match fitness and Lewis Ludlam out with damaged ribs, Jones is hoping Launchbury’s experience will help his squad “draw a line in the sand” and “light up Rome” this weekend. The management’s view, which will raise a few Scottish eyebrows, is that England would have won on Saturday 95 times out of 100 with slight improvements in certain areas. “We know the result wasn’t the way we wanted but, if you look at any objective data, we dominated the game,” said Jones, whose side finished fifth last season. “If you had a betting company and they got all the information from the game, we’d win probably 85 times out of 100. Now if we’d done a number of things a little bit better, we win the game 95 times. That means our performance was pretty good but that doesn’t mean you always win the game. “I’ve had this many times in my career, where you’ve played really well, dominated all the things that are important and still lose. Rather than me giving them the solutions I want the players to give me them. That’s the way coaching has changed to a great degree. I want them to own the problem, rather than me owning the problem.” On the subject of his substitutions, meanwhile, Jones has clarified that Smith was not replaced because of any specific GPS fitness data but largely on gut feel. “We don’t get any live GPS because of the stadiums,” the head coach said. “It’s about your observation and your gut feel, which is based on some data. “For instance, each of the players have a stress signal when they’re tired. When we take a player off it’s because they’ve shown us they’re in physical distress and don’t have much left in the tank.” So did Smith fit into that category? “His was more … I felt at that stage we needed to change things. I am in charge so my opinion is the only one that counts. We have a plan – like every coach does – but we adjust it to what is happening in the game. “I don’t have any regrets about what happened on Saturday in terms of the replacements we made. I’ve been a television commentator and I was the smartest coach in the world. It is easy, with the hindsight of replays, to get everything right. We got a yellow card which upset the apple cart a little bit.” Previous lean spells with Australia have also caused him to be slightly more phlegmatic about external opinions than he once was. “When I was with the Wallabies I allowed criticism of me to get to me and it affected my relationships with the players. Now that’s why I don’t pay any attention to the media. “I love these weeks as a coach. I don’t love the result but I love the challenge of trying to pull everyone together and back on the same page.” Whenever you have a loss, particularly when you have a young team, you can fragment a little bit. People start worrying about themselves. Our job is to make sure we stay together, stay tough and stay focused on what’s important.”",Sport/Sport,Jones has ‘no regrets’ after England’s Six Nations failure as Launchbury returns,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/08/eddie-jones-no-regrets-england-six-nations-failure-scotland
2/9/2022,"Jarrod Bowen of last season might not even have still been on the pitch. It is not that his 68th minute strike – the difference between West Ham and Watford on an otherwise nondescript night – was particularly late. But if a criticism could be labelled at the forward, it was his lack of endurance; Bowen completed 90 minutes eight times in 2020/21.  A summer spent running in potato fields and mixing cement with his Dad has done the trick as this was his 14th consecutive full stint (plus an additional 30 minutes at Kidderminster). His seventh Premier League strike of the season keeps West Ham’s European dream alive, halting a run of successive defeats. The sense though, is that much rests on Bowen – touted for an England debut in March – and Declan Rice if they are to avoid fading away. Watford have problems of a different kind. They have not won in 11 and have failed to score in their past three. Worryingly Emmanuel Dennis has done little of note since he was prevented from joining Nigeria at the Afcon on a technicality. Kurt Zouma’s widely anticipated exclusion on animal cruelty grounds failed to materialise. On Monday a video emerged showing Zouma kicking and slapping his cat. Surrey police and the RSPCA have launched a jointed investigation and the player has issued an apology. This was West Ham’s first home game since seven-year-old Isla Caton tragically passed away following a five-year battle with Neuroblastoma. The club and supporters raised vital funds towards her treatment, and there was a moving message from mum Nikki pre-match, followed by applause before kick-off and in the eighth minute. The first half, however, was less attractive although Roy Hodgson might have taken some pleasure from proceedings as Watford were impressively organised. Their season to date can be measured in degrees of chaos but Hodgson’s appointment has already led to an obvious shift. Three in attack has been dispensed with in favour of two banks of four. And having begun with a point – plus a much-needed first clean sheet of the season – at Burnley, Hodgson made two changes. Top-scorer Emmanuel Dennis returned from suspension, while Tom Cleverley’s inclusion for Ken Sema narrowed the midfield further. And the visitor’s clearest opening of the half came when Cleverley nipped the ball from a driving Declan Rice. Hassane Kamara overlapped on the left, stood up a cross at the far post but Juraj Kucka could only climb and plant his far post header wide. Moussa Sissoko would later drag a wrong-footed effort away from goal. At times it felt like West Ham were playing at half speed. The spark David Moyes implored them to find from within for their push for Europe was absent. And that spilled over to the stands, the bowl largely silent aside from boos from the visiting fans when Zouma was near the ball. The host’s only moment of note came when Jarrod Bowen shrugged off Samir’s attention and played an exquisite reverse pass to Saïd Benrahma. The forward’s first shot was blocked by a combination of Ben Foster and Craig Cathcart, his follow-up striking the outside of the post. Martin Atkinson had earlier been disinterested in howls for a back pass when Samir stretched to beat Michael Antonio to the ball. The second period started with no additional urgency. Vladimir Coufal’s long throw was only half cleared and after a little head tennis, Benrahma controlled with his chest on the edge of the box. His volley was sweetly struck but always dipping over. Antonio was again largely anonymous and by right should have been replaced. Moyes’ problem though is a lack of alternatives; it is now 915 days and counting since the club last signed a forward. It felt like a breakthrough would need to be forced, with Bowen starting to drop deeper to do so. And it finally came served with a large side of good fortune. Having collected the ball just inside the Watford half, Bowen pushed forward and shot from distance. Foster was preparing to save comfortably but was wrong-footed by a deflection off Samir. Bowen almost put the result beyond doubt late on, his cut inside ending with the ball striking a post with Foster getting the faintest touch. Watford came closest to an equaliser when Joshua King flashed a ball across the six-yard box; Dennis was nowhere to be seen.

2/9/2022,"For good or ill, we’ve come a long way since ER. When it aired in 1994, it was the first mainstream global hit to depict the medical profession with any degree of realism. Though it still had George Clooney as the hospital paediatrician so, y’know, it wasn’t literal warts and all, that’s for sure. Over in the UK, launching in the same year, but with inevitably more local – though still heartfelt – acclaim we had Cardiac Arrest. That was all warts, sliced off by the writer and former NHS doctor Jed Mercurio and placed under a brutally unforgiving microscope. He followed that up 10 years later with Bodies, a full dissection of the people, players and power structures that simultaneously support and destroy what could be the best health system in the world, adapted from his own autobiographical novel of the same name. This Is Going to Hurt (BBC One), looks a worthy challenger to the Mercurio throne, having been adapted by writer and former NHS doctor Adam Kay from his identically titled bestselling memoir. It follows junior doctor Adam – or, rather, at this remove I suppose “Adam”, played by Ben Whishaw – as he works his way through his “Brats and Twats” rotation (that’s the obstetrics and gynaecology ward for those of a non-medical background). This often means being literally elbow-deep in gore (during C-sections or, as we see in one of the opening scenes, keeping a prolapsed umbilical cord where umbilical cords are preferably kept until the baby is out). And it also means always dealing with too many patients at once, hoping for Tracey the good midwife (“I’d let her sew up my sister’s perineum”) and not the panicky one (“Non-reassuring Trace”), and ignoring the kind of profound fatigue that sees you fall asleep in your car for the night before you can drive it home.  Like the book, This Is Going to Hurt is full of images and scenes that you’ll hope to forget, but, more unexpectedly, it also retains the two most difficult aspects of the book (and those, incidentally, that remain with the reader long after the foreign-objects-up-orifices anecdotage has faded). The first is the fatigue, and the fathomless stupidities, injustices and lack of resources that cause it. The overstretched staff at every level – apart from consultant – are permanently at breaking point, every moment of every day requiring them to dig a little deeper into themselves to deliver basic care without melting down in front of an undeserving, or indeed deserving, patient. (And, both book and drama make clear, there is absolutely a distinction to be drawn between the two.) It is a bone-deep, inescapable weariness, so constant as to become almost invisible – until Adam’s well-rested boss Mr Lockhart (Alex Jennings) pays one of his condescending (if occasionally life-saving) visits, adding another type of twat to the department and reminding you what a reasonable work-life balance looks like. The second admirable feature is that the drama doesn’t soften the Adam who is presented in the book. Good intentions and compassion (and Whishaw’s fundamental benignity as an actor) are substantially scabbed over by his understandable bitterness and frustration at the junior doctor’s lot. They exist alongside a willingness to bully the few figures lower down the medical ladder than Adam, and a streak of arrogance that suggests an embryonic Lockhart lurks inside more doctors than you’d like to think. By the end of the first episode, Adam has made the mistake whose practical and psychological ramifications will play out over the series. It adds further to the burdens on his professional and domestic life with his longsuffering boyfriend (Rory Fleck Byrne) – a secret he is keeping from family and colleagues – and reminds us, always, of the life-and-death decisions required from frontline doctors and nurses every day. The fact that Adam’s story is set in 2006 – pre-Covid, pre-Brexit, pre-the last decade and more of Conservative rule, and all the de-staffing, defunding and privatisation by stealth that has marched in lockstep with it – is perhaps the most frightening thing of all. This is NHS life as it was lived under Gordon Brown and before the worst public health crisis in living memory. It invites us all to re-evaluate and understand just how much this must be hurting now.",Arts/Television & radio,This Is Going to Hurt review – Ben Whishaw stars in a realism-packed adaptation,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/08/this-is-going-to-hurt-review-ben-whishaw-stars-in-a-realism-packed-adaptation
