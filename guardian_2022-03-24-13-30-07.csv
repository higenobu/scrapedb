3/24/2022,"The Morrison government has been promising a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic since not long after lockdowns began in early 2020. Over the past 18 months it has announced nearly $1bn in funding for gas projects. But this has done almost nothing to aid the country’s recovery from the Covid recession for an obvious reason – gas power plants, pipelines and basins take years to develop and build. Further, as Greg Jericho has pointed out, the gas industry employs very few people. The Coalition is laying the foundation for a long-term expansion of a fossil fuel industry – in some cases with Labor’s support. The government is betting this decades-long, big-emitting infrastructure will remain viable while Australia, and much of the world, is promising to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, this week announced another $50.3m to support companies developing seven gas and carbon capture and storage projects. He said they were priorities under the government’s gas-fired recovery and the country had to make sure it had “adequate supply and storage to avoid expected shortfalls in production in southern Australia that could emerge by 2024”. In a speech to gas industry representatives, the minister said the “energy crisis in Europe” – exacerbated by Russia’s attack on Ukraine – “should act as a warning of what could happen in Australia if there is not enough investment in the gas sector here”. He made a similar point on social media. No. Putting aside whether it is in good taste to compare Australia’s situation with what’s facing countries currently affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, let’s briefly consider what has happened in Europe. Russia is a major fossil fuel exporter and has been providing the continent with up to 40% of its gas. For Germany, it’s 60%. European powers have been understandably criticised for allowing themselves to become increasingly reliant on Russia for energy while Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian regime has been taking documented steps to undermine global security and stability – and threatening to invade its neighbour. Energy prices in Europe spiked after the invasion but were already high due in significant part to gas shortages linked to Russia not increasing supply. Figures vary across the continent, but according to some estimates, gas prices are up about 65% and electricity 30% on average over the past year. As Taylor said, bills have skyrocketed, hurting households and shuttering businesses. National governments have been scrambling for alternative supplies. In some countries, but not all, the supply crisis has renewed talk about the need to accelerate the shift to renewable energy. Energy security and independence are live issues. The situation in Australia is markedly different. It already has energy independence thanks to its access to vast supplies of sun, wind, coal and gas. It just has to make decisions about how to use them. Australia does not have a gas shortage. It extracts more gas than it needs to meet domestic demand – many times over – but sells three-quarters overseas as LNG (liquified natural gas). This has made sense for fossil fuel producers, which reaped the financial benefits, but led to a sharp spike in the cost of gas for Australian consumers as the international market set, and inflated, the domestic price. Successive governments have allowed this to happen, and some LNG is tied up in long-term contracts - but there is no shortfall in what Australia produces. This is disputed. The amount of gas available from existing reservoirs in Victoria, in particular, is declining, and the state is more reliant on gas than other jurisdictions due to it being piped into homes for heating and cooking. Even with a concerted effort, it would take time to shut down that network and convert to clean electricity. But experts say the crunch may not hit as soon as 2024, and there are better ways to ensure people get what they need than by spending hundreds of millions of dollars locking in more of an expensive fuel that contributes to global heating. Tony Wood, from the Grattan Institute, believe the most sensible approach would be to set up a short-term gas import terminal in Victoria to supply it from existing fields in Western Australia, rather than the Coalition’s approach of investing in infrastructure that could take a decade to build and would soon be a “white elephant” as the push for cleaner solutions accelerates. There is an economic argument for a swift transition away from domestic gas use. Saul Griffith, an Australian who advised the US government on energy policy, last year estimated converting all home appliances and cars to run on clean electricity could eliminate a third of Australia’s emissions while saving households $40bn a year by 2028. This sort of plan to “electrify everything” would allow existing gas supplies to be used to meet demand in the few manufacturing industries in which there are currently no affordable alternatives. The Grattan Institute has estimated that fewer than 1% of Australian manufacturing jobs are in gas-intensive industries that would materially benefit from an industry expansion. Climate change was not mentioned in Taylor’s speech on Tuesday to the Australian domestic gas outlook conference in Sydney where he announced the new funding. The government’s position over time has been that gas is part of the solution to reduce emissions, both here and overseas, because it displaces coal and can back up renewable energy. But the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, last year warned countries could not open new oil and gas fields if they were to keep alive a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a goal that was acknowledged and strengthened in last year’s Glasgow climate pact. Gas is often said to have about half the emissions of coal when burned, but several studies have suggested its actual impact is higher than that, due to leakage of methane – a particularly potent greenhouse gas – during extraction and transport. Scientists have warned cutting methane emissions will be vital if 1.5C is to stay within reach. The US and European Union last year led a group of countries that signed up to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Australia declined to join them. The Morrison government’s stance has been regularly noticed and noted by global leaders – most recently by the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who this week singled out Australia as a “hold out” for refusing to commit to meaningful emissions reduction targets by 2030, as scientists say is necessary.",News/Environment,It’s nonsense for Angus Taylor to suggest Australia could face an energy crisis like Europe’s,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/its-nonsense-for-angus-taylor-to-suggest-australia-could-face-an-energy-crisis-like-europes
3/24/2022,"A woman who had an affair with Ben Roberts-Smith – and who alleges he punched her in the face after a function at Parliament House – has told a court she feared for her safety, and for her children, if the affair ever became public. Under cross-examination on Thursday, Person 17 was questioned at length about an affidavit she had filed to the court, seeking a non-publication order on her name and any identifying details. In it, she says “I am concerned for my safety and that of my children should our identities be revealed.” “Despite being very secretive, it seems some people have still be able to find out who I am and harass me and my family. “I am obviously most concerned about the physical and mental safety of my children.” The court granted Person 17 the suppression order. Person 17’s name, and the city in which she lives, have been inadvertently said in open court several times by Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Bruce McClintock SC, and once by Person 17 herself. Those details have been ordered stricken from the court transcripts and online recordings. This week in court, Person 17 said she was accosted by a stranger on a beach who showed her two photographs of her having sex with Roberts-Smith in a Brisbane hotel room. The shots appeared to have been taken through the hotel room window. The man threatened Person 17, she told the court: “He said ‘you’ve been seeing Ben Roberts-Smith’. He showed me the photos. I was to tell Emma [Roberts – Roberts-Smith’s then wife] about the affair or the photos would be made public.” Person 17 said Roberts-Smith had warned her, as their relationship foundered, he was “not someone you’d want to get on the wrong side of”. “If you turn on me I will burn your house down. It might not be you that gets hurt, it might be people that you love and care about,” Person 17 alleges Roberts-Smith said on another occasion. In her affidavit, Person 17 said other people, unknown to her, had also threatened her and her family. She said her husband had received an anonymous phone call from someone identifying themselves as “a friend of Ben and Emma [Roberts, Roberts-Smith’s wife]”, asking questions about the affair. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 17 said she received an email from an unknown account that referenced her affair with Roberts-Smith, saying “talking yourself up really is a poor way to get attention”. Person 17 said she is “extremely anxious to the point where I suffer panic attacks.. “I cry most days and am anxious about what is going to happen next. When I go out, I often feel paranoid.” Person 17, in her affidavit, said: “My grave fear is that if my name and identity is revealed, I will be subjected to harassment and vitriol by people who support Ben and think I am just a lying woman trying to bring down a war hero.” During her second day of cross-examination, Person 17 was also questioned exhaustively about events in early 2018, when Person 17 and Roberts-Smith attended a function at Parliament House. As they left the event, Person 17 fell down some stairs, hurting her head and left thigh. She said she asked to be taken to hospital, but Roberts-Smith refused, saying he would take care of her. In their room at a hotel in Canberra, she said Roberts-Smith was angry with her, yelling in her face “what the fuck have you done”, saying she had been flirtatious with other men, and had exposed their affair. Person 17 said she just wanted to go to bed and that her head hurt. She told the court, Roberts-Smith responded by saying “It’s going to hurt more”, or “I’ll show you hurt”. “And he punched me with his right fist on the side of my face and left eye … I ended up lying on the bed. I just lay there still because I didn’t know what he was going to do next.” In her affidavit, Person 17 told the court: “I have given the police photographic evidence of the black eye I suffered as a result of the assault and a series of Telegram messages from the day after the assault in which Ben is coaching me about how I should explain the black eye to my husband.” Person 17 has told the court she did not, ultimately, proceed with a formal complaint to police. In court on Thursday, Person 17 was questioned about Telegram messages included in her affidavit, sent between Roberts-Smith and herself, that discussed the injuries she’d sustained and her explanation to her husband. Under cross-examination, McClintock put it to Person 17 she was intoxicated on the night at Parliament House, and had injured her head falling down the stairs: “You have no memory of what happened.” “That’s not correct,” she replied. McClintock said Person 17’s allegation was “a complete fabrication”. “You have just made that up. He did not hit you.” “He did,” Person 17 said. In cross-examination, Person 17 was exhaustively questioned about the miscarriage of a pregnancy to Roberts-Smith. McClintock said she chose not to tell Roberts-Smith she had lost the pregnancy via phone message “in a calculated campaign of deceit, didn’t you”. McClintock said it was “appallingly dishonest … and manipulative”. Person 17 fought back tears as she told the court: “I still wanted to see him face to face, I was still going through something awful.” Roberts-Smith was questioned on the alleged incident at the Canberra hotel during his testimony before the court last year. He denied all allegations of violence or threatening behaviour, saying the allegations were “completely false”. “The whole story is a fabrication,” he told the court. “I’ve never hit a woman. I never would hit a woman. And I certainly never hit Person 17.” Roberts-Smith said Person 17 sustained the injuries to her face and side when she fell down the stairs at Parliament House. He said he did not believe she needed to go to hospital, and that he took her to the hotel room where he put an icepack on her head, put her to bed, and stayed awake all night checking she was OK. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court he and his wife were separated at the time he and Person 17 began their affair. His now ex-wife told the court this was not true, that they were not separated, and he pressured her to lie. “I’ve never had any qualms with using the word affair,” Roberts-Smith told the court.

3/24/2022,"Ash Barty would not be drawn on questions about any plans to remain in professional sport as the retiring tennis star looks forward to spending more time at home with family, having walked away at the very top of her game. Barty stunned the tennis world on Wednesday when she announced her retirement from the sport at the age of 25 and as the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion. The world No 1 said on Thursday she had no regrets after revealing in a video posted on social media a day earlier that she was “spent” physically and had nothing left to give the sport. It is the second time Barty has retired from tennis; she took an indefinite break from the game in 2014, during which she played cricket professionally for Brisbane Heat in the WBBL. The Queenslander is also a keen golfer, but refused to be drawn on whether she might try her hand at the highest level in a third sport. “I love sport. I’m a sport nut, like a lot of Australians are. I’ll be lured to it,” she said at a press conference in Brisbane. “I have always been an athlete in the sense of trying different things but we’ll see how we go.” When pressed on any plans she may have to return to sport, she remained tight-lipped. “You have to wait and see,” she said. “I’m not giving you everything right now. It’s alright. You can be patient. Patience is a virtue.” The three-time grand slam winner, who achieved a childhood dream in winning the All England Championships last year, said tennis would aways hold a special place in her heart, but she was looking forward to a life without the stresses associated with playing on the women’s tour. “I’m excited for what’s next,” she said. “For my next chapter as Ash Barty the person and not the athlete. I hit as recently as 10 days ago. So I will forever be connected to tennis. I’ll never stop loving the sport. I’ll never stop hitting tennis balls. “I just want to be doing it selfishly for me. I can’t wait to get out there with young boys and young girls and contribute in different ways. I’m really excited to have more time to do that, and I can’t wait to get on the court and teach my nieces and nephews and hope it brings them the same love that it brought me.” Barty, a proud Ngarigo woman who serves as the national Indigenous tennis ambassador for Tennis Australia, said her contributions to the Aboriginal and Indigenous side of the sport would only grow in retirement. “I’m really excited to have the opportunity to give Indigenous youth and Aboriginal youth around our nation more opportunity to get into the sport,” she said. “That’s something that we’ll work on down the track.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite the globe-trotting nature of the women’s tour, Barty said she had always been a “homebody” and was looking forward to less travel and more time with her family in Brisbane. “[It is a] new chapter for [fiancee] Garry and I and it’s going to be a lot of fun.” Tennis Australia chief executive, Craig Tiley, said earlier the governing body would acknowledge Barty’s career, but it would wait for the dust to settle on the bombshell news before announcing exact plans. “I think there’ll be many ways to honour Ash and we have to figure out how to do that,” Tiley said. “The legacy she leaves is not only being a great champion on the court, having won three of the grand slams, one of the three players in the world to have been no 1 for three years, but being the type of person that everyone loves and I think her legacy will always be one of a gracious and humble champion.”",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty refuses to be drawn on sporting future but retired tennis star ‘excited for next chapter’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/ash-barty-refuses-to-be-drawn-on-sporting-future-but-retired-tennis-star-excited-for-next-chapter
3/24/2022,"On 24 February, shortly before dawn broke in Moscow, Vladimir Putin made the latest in a series of televised addresses. His previous appearances had contained increasingly ominous tirades about Ukraine. Now here was the culmination: the declaration of what the Russian president euphemistically called a “special military operation”. The goal, said Putin, was the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine. Minutes later, missiles were launched towards Kyiv, Kharkiv and many other Ukrainian cities. For the Ukrainians who woke up to sound of the impacts, and then for millions across the world who woke up to the news of Putin’s decision, the first reaction was shock. Even those Ukrainians in government who had spent the past weeks rehearsing what to do in the event of a Russian attack were stunned when the invasion became reality. “I had 10 minutes of panic when I was running around the house and I had no idea what to do. Then I pulled myself together and went to work,” said Natalia Balasynovych, the mayor of Vasylkiv, a town outside Kyiv hosting an airbase that was hit in the first hours of the war. Before long, makeshift checkpoints were being put up across the country, volunteers flocked to sign up for territorial defence units, and even some pensioners got to work making molotov cocktails. At the same time, millions of people, mostly women and children, fled to the west of Ukraine, or crossed borders into neighbouring countries. During the first days of the war there was a sense that something terrible and momentous had occurred that would change the contours of global affairs irrevocably, but also confusion about exactly how it might look, and what it meant for the future of Ukraine, Russia, Europe and the world. As Putin’s invasion reaches the month mark on Thursday, some of those questions have been answered but much still hangs in the balance. Among the international community there are ongoing debates about how firm a line to take with Russia, and where the divide is between a moral obligation to support Ukraine and potentially provoking Moscow into further escalation, as for the first time since the early 1980s Putin has floated the possibility of using nuclear weapons. The initial Russian plan, it seems, was that its operation would be a kind of slightly bloodier version of its 2014 Crimea annexation, with pockets of resistance mopped up and then a Russian puppet regime taking control. The plan, which could only have been based on shockingly flawed intelligence about the mood in Ukraine and the state of its army, was quickly shown to be hopeless. A speedy advance on Kyiv faltered and devolved into grim fighting in the western suburbs. Attempts to take Kharkiv and other cities in the east were repelled, with heavy Russian losses. Even in the few cities where the Russians have established control bloodlessly, in the south of the country, their forces face angry crowds and have had few successes in co-opting local politicians. “For years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come,” said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in one of his frequent video addresses. “They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders.” The lack of success has led to a grimmer phase of the war. The idea that the tactics Russia used in Syria would be morally and politically unpalatable for Russia’s leadership, given the family ties between millions of Russians and Ukrainians, quickly proved naive. Russia showed itself willing to submit Mariupol, Kharkiv and other Russian-speaking cities to ruthless artillery and air bombardment. For Ukraine, amid the heartache and the bloodshed, there is the feeling of a new sense of national identity being born, even as the threat of the eradication of the state by the Russian military has far from subsided. A country where many different ideas of what it means to be Ukrainian have lived in sometimes uneasy coexistence has now found a common idea around which to unite. “I suppose they hoped it would not be like this, when ordinary people come out without weapons to stop tanks and tell them to leave,” said Gennady Trukhanov, the Russian-speaking mayor of Odesa, who had once been considered a Russian stooge. He added that only “a bastard, idiot or scumbag” would drop bombs on Odesa. The horrific stories emerging from those residents of Mariupol who have been able to escape in recent days make Putin’s claim a month ago that his attack was meant to defend Russian speakers from Kyiv’s “genocide” seem even more twisted than it sounded back then. In 2014 Mariupol was split between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian elements and saw violent street clashes, but since then it had been renovated and spruced up by Ukrainian authorities. The terror in which its residents have been living as hostages over the past weeks is a tragedy that is likely to be remembered for decades to come. For Russia’s stalled, bloody military campaign, there appears to be no imminent possibility for a dignified retreat or a peace deal that could be sold as victory, but also no clear route to a military victory either, except perhaps through an intensification of aerial bombardment to destroy Ukraine rather than subdue it. Whether this would be palatable for the elite around Putin is a key question, and one which has had Kremlinologists trying to understand the increasingly opaque world of Putin’s inner circle. What is clear is that Putin’s decision has irrevocably changed Russia as well as Ukraine. The Russian president built a large part of his political appeal on providing stability and economic progress, and even recently he liked to compare his rule with that of the turbulent 1990s. Now he has gone some way to recreating that instability in a matter of weeks, as planes stop flying, western brands head for the exit and the rouble tanks. Unlike in 2014, when part of international public opinion was amenable to Russian narratives on the annexation of Crimea, this time the Russian actions have been so heinous that the Kremlin finds itself with few international defenders. Russian officials have been taken aback by the strength and scope of the western response, as well as by the speed with which the political climate at home has darkened. It is hard to tell if the Ukraine war marks the beginning of the end for Putin and his system, or simply the beginning of a long period that is much darker than what went before. Some in the Russian elite – such as the head of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, or the foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova – have revelled in the new, darker climate. Zakharova, who just a week before the war was taunting western journalists for reporting US claims that a Russian invasion was possible, has now embraced it. At a flag-waving rally at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow last week, she said Russia was “fighting evil”. Many others in the elite are horrified by Putin’s war, and the decision appears to have come as a surprise to all but a very few close confidants. But this unease so far remains muted, while domestic repression increases and increasingly sinister public warmongering fills the airwaves. For Ukraine’s president, too, the past month has seen a transformation of his behaviour and reputation. Zelenskiy, on the eve of the war, often appeared to be a man struggling to play the admittedly awful hand he had been dealt. He spoke in confused and rambling sentences, at once talking up and diminishing the Russian threat, clearly alarmed by the warnings from Washington and London but keen to save the Ukrainian economy in the event Putin did not invade. Now, while Putin broods in his bunker, Zelenskiy has been speaking with presidents, prime ministers and the pope, addressing parliaments across the world, and releasing a series of snappy, passionate video addresses to his people. Despite the rather half-hearted attempts by Russian bloggers to claim Zelenskiy has in fact long since fled Ukraine and all the videos are fakes, it is clear that the president and his inner circle have stayed in the capital, ignoring western evacuation offers and suggestions to move the centre of government to Lviv in the west, even as there were credible intelligence reports of hit squads sent to kill him. In the process, Zelenskiy has gained overwhelming support from many Ukrainians, even those who were previously his political opponents. “Free people of a free nation,” he began one of the latest of these addresses on Tuesday. “Each day of this war makes it increasingly clear what their ‘denazification’ is.” With exhausted eyes but plenty of passion in his voice, Zelenskiy listed the latest civilian casualties of the Russian attack, and the latest Ukrainians to be awarded bravery medals. “It was a day of difficult events … but it was another day that brought us all closer to our victory and to peace for our state,” said Zelenskiy, ending his address. Ukraine has suffered terrible losses over the past month, but few expected that in four weeks Russia’s campaign against its neighbour would have achieved so few results for Putin on the ground. There is a long way to go towards any outcome that could be considered a victory for Ukraine, but with each day that passes, more Ukrainians believe Zelenskiy, and that a victory of some sort is possible.",News/World news,One month on: how a tragedy has unfolded in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/one-month-on-how-a-tragedy-has-unfolded-in-ukraine-russia-war
3/24/2022,"China’s new ambassador to Australia has declared Beijing has no intention of interfering in the upcoming federal election, saying it has “no choice of this party or that party”. Xiao Qian, who arrived in Canberra in January, also stopped short of condemning Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, despite calls from both major parties in Australia for Beijing to press Moscow to end the war.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been seeking to campaign on tough national security credentials ahead of the election, which is due in May. He and his defence minister, Peter Dutton, told parliament last month that the Chinese Communist party had “picked their horse” in the election and that Labor was the “preferred partner”, despite both parties having similar policies on China. When asked on Thursday about the election, Xiao said the Chinese government has “a policy, it’s a policy of principle, that we never interfere with the domestic affairs of any country”. “The election of this country is the domestic affair of Australia,” he said. “We have no intention, no interest to get involved. We have no choice of this party or that party. But whoever is going to be the ruling party after the election, we are looking forward to a more positive relationship.” Xiao insisted that Beijing would be willing to work with the winning party in the election “to put our relationship back on the right track, back to the right direction, so that China and Australia can move forward to the benefit of our two countries and peoples”. But despite making an overture last month for the two countries to “meet each other halfway”, he is yet to publicly spell out any tangible actions Beijing may be willing to take, for example reversing tariffs on Australian wine and barley that are subject to a World Trade Organization challenge. Xiao arrived in Canberra in January after years of increasing tensions between the two countries over a range of issues including trade, security and human rights. Australia’s laws against foreign interference have been one source of tension with Beijing. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull singled out China when he introduced that bill to the lower house, and said Australia was right to defend its sovereignty. “Media reports have suggested that the Chinese Communist party has been working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and even the decisions of elected representatives right here in this building,” Turnbull told parliament in 2017. “We take these reports very seriously.” The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, said in his annual threat assessment speech last month that the security agency had foiled an alleged foreign interference plot. Burgess told reporters that foreign interference was “an increasing concern” but said he was confident Australian authorities were ready to counter any attempts to interfere with this year’s election. The spy chief said: “Attempts at political interference are not confined to one side of politics, and you’d be surprised by the range of countries involved.” Xiao Qian spoke briefly to reporters after an event at the Chinese embassy in Canberra on Thursday, taking just three questions. Asked what representations the Australian government had made to him over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and what his response had been, Xiao said the situation was “very, very complicated”. He called for Nato and Russia to talk about developing a “a more efficient, sustainable security mechanism in Europe” where both sides felt safe. Both Morrison and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, have said there is no justification for Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Xiao said China had been “trying our best to play a constructive role” including encouraging dialogue and negotiations and offering humanitarian aid to Ukraine. In the past few weeks, Xiao has met with both Marise Payne and Penny Wong. Payne and Wong have expressed their openness to dialogue while saying Australia won’t take a backward step on matters of national interest and sovereignty. Xiao said he was “very sad to see” that there were political problems in the relationship between Australia and China, and “this is not what the Chinese side would like to see”. In an implicit rejection of Canberra’s view that Beijing’s more assertive approach was responsible for the spiral in the relationship, Xiao said: “On the part of China, our policy towards Australia remains unchanged. We are here to seek a friend.” But he said he was “ready to engage more with our friends and colleagues from our Australian side”.",News/Australia news,"‘We never interfere’: China will not try to influence federal election, says new ambassador to Australia",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/we-never-interfere-china-will-not-try-to-influence-federal-election-says-new-ambassador-to-australia
3/24/2022,"Covid outbreaks in Samoa and Vanuatu have further whittled down the number of Pacific island nations that have so far escaped the pandemic, as case numbers surge after the first instances of community transmission in both countries. Tuvalu, Nauru and Micronesia are now the only remaining Pacific island countries that have not recorded any cases of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. Samoa recorded its first case of community transmission last week, when an American missionary tested positive in preparation for a flight out. The country has recorded 467 cases over the past seven days, bringing total cases to 515, with experts suggesting the virus had likely been spreading before the first case was detected. The country has closed its borders and gone into lockdown, shutting down schools and banning public gatherings. In Vanuatu, where the first case of community transmission was reported earlier this month, cases have spiked in the past week with 279 reported on Wednesday alone, bringing the total number since the beginning of the year 1,373. The country is now at its highest alert level, with restrictions on movement and mandatory mask wearing in public. Public health expert and Dean Pacific at the University of Auckland, Dr Colin Tukuitonga, said the Covid surge did not come as a surprise. “This is not unexpected, given the Omicron spread, but it’s good that most Pacific islands have been able to vaccinate people, thus containing the spread.” Vaccination rates vary widely among Pacific nations with some, such as Samoa where 66% of the total population is vaccinated, having relatively high levels of coverage. Others, such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, have much lower rates, at 28% and 17% respectively, according to the WHO. The acting director-general of health in Samoa, Tagaloa Dr Robert Thomsen, told the media that the health system was prepared for an influx of cases. “In the event that our current capacity is exhausted, the ministry will activate its contingency plan, and we have already identified halls and certain school buildings for a possible overflow,” he said. Tagaloa told the media that two specialist engineers are in quarantine in Samoa to work on establishing a new oxygen plant. “Our current capacity is between 20 and 30 tanks a day, however, this new plant will allow us to fill up to 100 or even more in a day.” “Samoa will be prepared for the outbreak in terms of oxygen,” Tagaloa said. Although the WHO has not registered any Covid deaths in Samoa or Vanuatu, the Vanuatu Daily Post reported that a woman in South Santo who had underlying conditions and tested positive for Covid, died last week. Tukuitonga, who has supported Pacific governments in health policies for many years, said there were cultural dimensions behind the outbreaks. “Communal living and social interactions and big families are normally good for cohesion but increases risks of spread.” He said that substandard housing and high prevalence of co-morbidities such as diabetes are additional factors. The recent surge in cases has caused panic across the Pacific as outbreaks have hit small island states previously untouched by the pandemic, and left them bracing for long lockdown periods as well as putting strain on already fragile public health systems. Kiribati recorded its first Covid death in January with the death toll now at 13 and the total number of positive cases at 3,057, according to the WHO. Palau has recorded almost 4,000 cases and six deaths since the start of the year. Solomon Islands, which also reported its first case of community transmission in January, has the highest number of Covid deaths at 128 with a total case count of 10,204. In American Samoa, 1,626 cases have been recorded – 847 in the past week – a large number for a territory which only has a population of just over 55,000. In Tonga, which had been Covid-free until the virus arrived with relief efforts following January’s volcanic eruption and tsunami, cases have reached 3,784, with just over 1,700 reported in the last seven days.",News/World news,Covid outbreaks in Samoa and Vanuatu chip away at Pacific islands’ virus-free status ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/covid-outbreaks-in-samoa-and-vanuatu-chip-away-at-pacific-islands-virus-free-status
