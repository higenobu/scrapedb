3/16/2022,"Scott Morrison has left the door open to introducing sanctions against China, Australia’s largest trading partner, if Chinese president Xi Jinping’s regime were to provide military equipment to Russia. The prime minister said his government would move in lockstep with its allies and partners in response to what he called Beijing’s “chilling silence” on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said any move by China to arm Russia would be “an abomination”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, also said China’s failure to condemn Russia “should send alarm bells across the world” while he suggested that “all free nations will face a darker tomorrow” if Vladimir Putin succeeds. “It is becoming clear that Putin’s Ukrainian gamble has been a miscalculation that may very well destroy the man himself,” Dutton told a United States Studies Centre event in Canberra. But experts questioned whether a so-called “palace coup” against Putin was likely, and whether Australia would expand sanctions to cover China. China remains Australia’s largest trading partner, despite Beijing launching a series of trade actions against Australian export sectors in recent years that have been at the centre of a downward spiral in the relationship. Dennis Richardson, former head of the departments of defence and foreign affairs, said it would surprise him “if we got to the point where sanctions were being imposed on China” because Beijing was likely to “operate in a grey area”. With an election looming in Australia in May, both major parties have stepped up their pleas for China to press Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine, citing the “no limits” partnership formalised between the two countries six weeks ago. The focus on Beijing has increased after US officials said they feared China had already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support and was contemplating sending military supplies, such as armed drones. Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said earlier this week that Beijing would “absolutely” face consequences if it helped Moscow avoid sanctions. Asked on Wednesday whether there was potential for Australia to impose sanctions against China, Morrison said: “We will move in lockstep with our partners and allies on these issues, and the United States has made some very clear statements about this and we support those statements.” He called on China “to be very transparent” about the nature of its relationship with Russia “when it comes to throwing them an economic lifeline during this global crisis”. The prime minister said Beijing should also clarify “potentially what, if any, support has been discussed for military support for Russia, because that would be an abomination”. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was also asked about the possibility of sanctions against China and replied that he supported Australia “acting in conjunction with our partners in the world”. “China has a responsibility to call out Russia’s behaviour and its aggression. It’s outrageous, it’s against international law, and it should be called out by all countries,” Albanese said. Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, met with China’s new ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, on Wednesday and expressed “her serious concerns over reports that Russia has asked China for weapons”. “Senator Wong urged China to support the people of Ukraine and its sovereignty, and not provide weapons to Russia,” said a readout issued by Wong’s office. China has not explicitly criticised Russia and it has not described it as an invasion, insisting that “all parties” should exercise restraint and “cool the situation down instead of adding fuel to the fire”. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, responded to reports that China had signalled its willingness to provide military assistance to Russia by accusing the US of “spreading disinformation”. At a daily press conference in Beijing, Zhao said the US should “deeply reflect upon its role in the evolving situation of the Ukraine crisis, and do more things that can help to ease the situation”. Pressed on whether China would rule out adding fuel to the fire by sending support to Russia, Zhao said: “Our position on the Ukraine issue is beyond reproach.” Richardson said Russia and China shared a strategic objective in weakening US global leadership. But he predicted Beijing would seek to limit any assistance provided to Russia in order to avoid reaching the threshold for western economic punishment. Richardson noted China had abstained, rather than explicitly sided with Russia, when the United Nations voted on motions deploring the invasion of Ukraine. “I think China will give what support it can to Russia that it thinks that it can get away with,” Richardson told the National Press Club on Wednesday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Paul Dibb, another former senior defence official and strategic analyst, dismissed the likelihood of a “palace coup” or a popular uprising against Putin. He said the likelihood of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny facing another 13 years in prison reflected Putin’s approach to dissent. Dibb said Putin had curbed media coverage and tightened the security agencies protecting him, and “only listens to people who agree with him”. “I noticed Minister Dutton implied that there might be an internal issue,” Dibb said. “Well, with due respect, Minister, unless you have – and the Americans have – an agent inside the Kremlin, you ain’t going to get it. “I hope Dutton is right, but … this is not going to be at all easy.” Comment was sought from the Chinese and Russian embassies.",News/Australia news,‘An abomination’: Morrison signals sanctions against China if it helps arm Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/an-abomination-morrison-signals-sanctions-against-china-if-it-helps-arm-russia
3/16/2022,"“What are the fewest number of appearances for a club to have resulted in a testimonial? Must be a back-up goalkeeper surely?” tweets SixStarsUK. The time-honoured tradition of the testimonial is usually reserved for players who have reached a decade at a particular club, but not always. “Norman Clarke made just four league and one League Cup appearance for Sunderland in the 1962-3 season before injury cut his career short aged 21,” writes John Briggs. “He was awarded a testimonial on 28 September 1966 when 11,000-plus spectators watched a 6-6 draw against a ‘Charlton’s XI’ (Jimmy Montgomery playing on the wing for Sunderland and scored two, Jack Charlton played in goal). Clarke returned to Ireland where he continued playing for Ballymena United and later scouted for Liverpool.” A career-ending injury also led to John O’Neill being granted a testimonial with Norwich, despite playing little over half an hour for the club. “John O’Neill, the Northern Irish centre-half, suffered a career-ending injury on his City debut in 1987 (after a decade at Leicester and a short spell at QPR),” writes Roger Whittaker. “Norwich gave him a testimonial, even though he only played 34 minutes for them before having his knee rearranged by John Fashanu.” Gary Lineker, then at Barcelona, scored a hat-trick in an 8-2 victory for O’Neill’s Select XI. Fashanu later agreed to pay £70,000 in an out-of-court settlement after a high-profile court case in 1994 (during which O’Neill’s expert witness was Ken Aston, referee for Italy and Chile’s notorious “Battle of Santiago” at the 1962 World Cup), though O’Neill was left with £150,000 of legal costs. Finally, here’s Stephen Curnow. “I accept that non-playing staff are rather against the spirit of the question, but nevertheless I would like to put forward the case of Tim Sheppard, Norwich City physiotherapist from 1980-2001. Tim’s tenure spanned some of the club’s greatest successes, he having been on the bench through two promotions, a Milk Cup win, a European campaign, two FA Cup semi-finals and the club’s three best league finishes. He also had a brief cameo in Fever Pitch. Tim was awarded a testimonial upon his departure, appearing for his solitary minutes against Celtic at Carrow Road, the visitors winning 4-2.” “Given that the player of the match is usually announced around the 89th minute, what is the worst-ever performance of one after the announcement has been made?” wonders Andrew Chambers. Thanks to pundits either not paying enough attention or at the very least playing it safe, there are plenty of players who’ve been handed the gong having done little more than spend much of the 90 minutes struggling to get a touch of the ball only to poke home a key goal. However, for a fine example of this, we turn to one of the great games (and sliding doors moments) in English football history. “I nominate Vince Bartram, who was announced as man of the match for Gillingham against Manchester City in the 1999 third tier play-off final with 89:30 on the clock and the Gills 2-0 up,” writes Ian Kay. “Within 20 seconds Kevin Horlock pulled a goal back and Paul Dickov got the equaliser in the 95th minute. Goalkeeper Bartram – Dickov’s best man, incidentally – didn’t save any penalties in the shootout either, as City won it 3-1 (despite Dickov’s penalty hitting both posts and coming back to him).” “A lot of questions go unanswered,” begins Eugene Francis. “I feel this will be one: has a goalkeeper ever taken a corner?” Step forward Javi Yegros of CD Pedrusco de Garbayuela in Spain, who not only took a corner but only went and scored from it as well. “I imagine many goalkeepers have taken corners, but Yegros stands out,” writes Tim Dockery. “He had trained as an outfield player until an injury made him switch to exclusively playing in goal. With his team (in Extremadura’s local second division) down 1-0 and time running out, he went upfield to take his side’s free-kicks and eventually a couple of corners. On the last play of the game, he mis-hit his corner and a strong wind carried it directly into the goal to tie the game. It’s the only instance I know of where a goalie scored an Olympic goal.” In response to the question “What is the most common day of the week for the English league championship to be decided?”, fuzzybluerain started delving. It’s an impressive work in progress, so if there are any gaps you can help fill in … “In Roy Hattersley’s book, The Edwardians, there’s a photo described as ‘the Edwardian England football team’. They are wearing white shirts and dark shorts, but curiously the shirts bear the Union Jack rather than the flag of St George. Was the Union Jack generally used by England teams back then, or was it just a cock-up?” asked Matt Boyson in January 2008. The union flag was the favoured emblem of English football teams until surprisingly recently. Footage of the 1966 World Cup shows Wembley dotted with red, white and blue flags, while tournament mascot World Cup Willie was a lion wearing a Union flag jersey. In 1982 Ron Greenwood’s England squad were still urging us to “hear the roar of the red white and blue” on official tune This Time, a seven-inch single with a union flag on the label. It was only really at Euro 96 that the nation’s red-and-white fetish kicked in properly. Matthew Engel, writing in the Guardian, noted “this new cult of St George” after England’s exit in the semi-finals. Ten years later 27% of English adults bought a flag of St George during the 2006 World Cup. And a fat lot of good it did too. “Are Chelsea the first football club to be hit with government sanctions?” asks Colin Babe. “On Saturday Viking played Kongsvinger in the last 16 of the Norwegian cup,” writes Arne Bjarne Fjøsmælås. “Viking won 2-0, scoring after 28 seconds in the first half and 21 seconds in the second half. Of course, faster goals have been scored in both halves, but are there any better than a total of 49 seconds for both combined?” “We know the Wright/Wright-Phillips family can run to three generations of professional footballers, but are there any examples of four or more generations?” wonders David Burrows. “With little over a month to go in their season, Craigmark Burntonians of the West of Scotland League have a chance of being promoted to tier six of the Scottish pyramid and a chance of being relegated to tier nine,” notes Doug Coyle. “Has any team been less certain of their status next season this late on?” “With David de Gea picking the ball out of his net four more times against City, I’m wondering if he’s the keeper who’s conceded most goals in the Manchester derby,” muses Philip Grey. “It seems natural to wonder which keeper has conceded most goals in any derby (two clubs from the same city, not fake derbies that really aren’t derbies).”  Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",Sport/Football,Which footballer played the fewest games to earn a testimonial? | The Knowledge,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/who-played-the-fewest-games-to-earn-a-testimonial-the-knowledge
3/16/2022,"If you were lucky enough to be a small kid roaming Disney World’s Epcot Center until just a few years ago, you would have seen a ride nestled next to the monorail tracks that beckoned with gleaming mirror walls. An indoor ride, it was a welcome reprieve from the Florida sun. After buckling into your seat in what seemed like a theater auditorium, and the lights dimmed, a familiar figure would appear on the huge screen in front of you. “You’re probably surprised to see me here, aren’t you?” pealed a twinkly Ellen DeGeneres. The ride purported to tell the story of energy. It was awe-inspiring and warm-hearted in the Disney mold and also featured Jamie Lee Curtis, the late Jeopardy host Alex Trebek and science communicator Bill Nye. What went unsaid was the fact that, for a theme park, it had an unlikely corporate sponsor: the US oil giant Exxon. And the message directed at the often young minds of riders was brazen and, in the light of the climate emergency now unfolding, quite remarkable: fossil fuels are glorious and the climate crisis is not such a big deal. Yet somehow, even though it only shuttered in 2017, the ride has largely been lost to cultural history. But now, as Exxon and other oil firms face a wave of lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for the climate crisis, grounded by charges that they sought to deceive the public about their role in it, the ride seems newly relevant as evidence of the kind of narrative big oil sought to promote. Exxon supported it although the company had known for decades how ruinous the climate crisis would be, but kept its findings secret. 1982, the year the ride opened, was the same year that Exxon’s own scientists predicted that a spike in carbon dioxide emissions would result in the warming of the planet. So buckle up for the story of Ellen’s Energy Adventure. The ride begins with riders still watching a movie screen as DeGeneres, snuggling with her cat in front of an episode of Jeopardy!, takes a nap. She dreams that she is a contestant on the show, alongside Curtis and Albert Einstein. All the questions are themed around energy. (For instance: fossil fuels for $100!) DeGeneres finds that her knowledge of fossil fuels pales beside that of Curtis, who plays a smarmy scientist type. Nye happily materializes to take her on an educational journey back, way back about 220m years. We soar past dazzling solar systems and nebulas, zeroing in on a familiar blue marble, and crash-land in a tropical forest. We hear the cries of strange animals. DeGeneres, confused: Where’s the energy? Nye, wearing a pith hat: Oh, it’s all around you! See these plants and animals are soaking up energy from the sun. When they die and get buried, time, pressure and heat will cook them into the fossil fuels we rely on today – like coal, natural gas and oil! And now the ride becomes very different, as the cinema screen disappears and the seating sections begin to move, passing dioramas of roaring animatronic dinosaurs, and even an animatronic model of DeGeneres herself fighting a feisty reptile. It is Jurassic Park, but cheesier. When the movie resumes, the ride’s sympathies have all the subtlety of a tyrannosaurus. Nye teaches DeGeneres about renewables, but warns they can’t provide all of humanity’s needs. Riders are then treated to lyrical aerial shots of a coal train and jaunty music. Nye tells DeGeneres not to worry about the world’s energy problems – there are thankfully two centuries’ worth of coal left for us to burn. DeGeneres, guileless: What about global warming? Nye, noncommittal: It’s a hot topic with lots of questions and it’s one of the big reasons scientists are working on ways to burn fuels like coal more efficiently than ever. (Factcheck: the industry promises of “clean coal” have not been borne out.) Cue shots of a gas power plant (Nye, incorrectly, states: “It’s clean-burning!”) and oil rigs. A worried DeGeneres asks Nye whether we’ll run out of oil. Nye reassures her that we’re always finding more. For the ride’s finale, DeGeneres returns to Jeopardy!. She vanquishes that unctuous Jamie Lee Curtis and realizes the true, Disney-esque conclusion of the whole experience: The world’s greatest source of energy is in fact … (God help us) the human mind. Though understated compared with the rollercoasters and 4D rides, Ellen’s Energy Adventure was a beloved part of the Disney machine. It built up a devoted fandom that spawned countless YouTube videos, tweets, wikis and blogposts. “It was the very first Disney attraction I ever experienced,” says 27-year-old Landon, a Disney enthusiast whose family took him there when he was 13 (and who did not want to share his last name). “I enjoyed the cheesy humor and the prehistoric animatronics. As midwesterners, it felt pretty fresh.” DeGeneres, Nye, Disney and Exxon all did not respond to requests for comment for this story, so everyone’s motivations will remain somewhat mysterious. But Exxon and other oil firms have engaged in a decades-long campaign to counter climate warnings, which would entail attempting to intimidate its critics, deploying DC lobbyists, releasing misleading statements while suppressing factual information and yes, also capturing the hearts and minds of impressionable youth at the happiest place on Earth. The ride wasn’t the only collaboration Exxon had with Disney – they also published a comic book featuring Goofy and Mickey Mouse. And Exxon wasn’t the only energy company wooing kids. BP used to sponsor an exhibit at a New Orleans aquarium. The same BP that was behind the largest marine oil spill in history somewhere off the coast of New Orleans. At Disney, “it’s easy to imagine that they wanted to indoctrinate children so that children don’t realize that ExxonMobil is destroying the future planet that they will inherit, which is incredibly machiavellian and evil,” says prominent climatologist Dr Michael Mann. Fast forward and Ellen’s Energy Adventure with all its oil-shilling playfulness is long gone, and is in the process of being replaced by a newer, flashier Guardians of the Galaxy ride. (“What is pain” one fan account tweeted about its closure.) Fossil fuel interests have moved on to more sophisticated tactics to sway the public, no longer outright denying the impact of climate change but shifting to a strategy of deflection and delay. The cost of changing to another energy source is simply too prohibitive, they say, even though “the cost of inaction now far exceeds the cost of action”, explains Mann. And it turns out that fossil fuel giants might have been right to be concerned about children. In this modern age, one of the great threats to our world’s fossil fuel dependency is the youth climate movement. (An Opec boss seemed to say as much.) As we struggle to find a way forward, it’s illuminating to look backward at this bizarre ride that originated in the pre-internet age and will forever live at the intersection of climate disruption, corporate deception and millennial nostalgia. In what feels like a prescient scene from the ride, a chirpy DeGeneres glances at the audience in the middle of her time-traveling dream sequence and quips: “Is this a nightmare, or what?”",News/Environment,"A pro-fossil fuel Disney ride voiced by Ellen DeGeneres and Bill Nye?

3/16/2022,"When Major League Soccer decided to build Centene Stadium in St Louis, the first priority was honoring the “the hard truths of past”. The 22,500-seat soccer-specific stadium is designed with canopy shading and is 40ft below street level. It also sits on the same block that was once a part of Mill Creek Valley, the predominantly Black neighborhood on the Southwest end of St Louis once home to 20,000 residents, 800 businesses and more than 40 religious institutions. In addition to Madame ‘CJ’ Walker, America’s first Black woman millionaire, Mill Creek was also home to Josephine Baker, Scott Joplin and General William Tecumseh Sherman. Even poet Walt Whitman was known to visit the thriving Black community. But in the summer of 1959, the residents of Mill Creek Valley were displaced and the neighborhood demolished in the name of “urban renewal”. Now the embryonic MLS club St Louis City SC and Great Rivers Greenway are using the stadium as a platform to tell the story of Mill Creek Valley. “It was really setting a precedent of starting as a community-led brand and community-led club that was actually entrenched in the community in more ways than just the sport,” says Khalia Collier, vice-president of community relations for St Louis City SC. Mill Creek Valley, as it once was, spanned the downtown west district of St Louis. Today, the one-mile stretch of the Brickline Greenway linking Centene Stadium to Harris-Stowe State University, the city’s HBCU, will be a standing tribute to the community that was lost. Artist and native St Louisan Damon Davis says Mill Creek Valley is a virtually unknown part of Black history he was previously not aware of. “I learned about it during the research phase of preparing the application,” Davis says. “I was kind of embarrassed. Growing up we learned about Black history and I knew about all these people around the world, but I didn’t know this place existed.” Davis own the bid to design the artwork for the Counterpublic Civic Art Exhibition in 2023 and, after learning about the neighborhood, he wanted to know more. As a result, Davis was moved to create a monument that he says will never be forgotten. The greenway and public art installation runs from 20th to 22nd Street and consists of eight pillars or hourglasses that represent time – or a collective history that Davis says had been glossed over. Within each hourglass is a pyramid symbolic the earth or sand at a standstill. “If the sand is not falling that means time is not moving, so the idea of the pyramid being in the top chamber, is the idea we have stopped for a second to commemorate and to have reverence for these histories that were purposely covered up,” Davis says. “There was an intention behind removing these people from the narrative of St Louis and now there must the same intention behind bringing their stories back to life.” In between the pillars in front of Centene Stadium and Harris-Stowe State University will be interpretative signs and individual pillars connecting the few remaining buildings from Mill Creek Valley along the greenway. Davis interviewed former residents and then inscribed quotes inside of each of the individual pillars. “The quotes will tell you a story about Mill Creek,” Davis says. “St. Louis wouldn’t be what is without these people.” From the 1950s to the mid 80s, St Louis was considered the soccer capital of the US thanks to a large immigrant population from Germany, Italy and Ireland that produced more homegrown soccer players than any other state. Currently. St Louis has acres of soccer fields spanning out into the Northwest suburbs of Chesterfield, Fenton and St Charles, but as Collier says. once you cross the Daniel Boone Bridge, you scarcely know the sport exists. St Louis City FC’s headquarters, training facility and stadium are strategically located within a 10-mile radius of the downtown west district. The location makes it easy to prioritize resources and give sustainable infrastructure where it did not exist, Collier says. Right now, the expansion club is working through an infrastructure plan to make the game more accessible. The areas of impact are youth development – which prioritizes Black and brown children having access to the soccer – community investment, social justice, and health and wellness. “You can say bridging the gap in the game of soccer is really lofty, but how we’re going about doing it is incredibly intentional and we’re calling community members in, so they see these opportunities of us integrating technology and sport innovation in a way that’s simply hasn’t been done,” Collier says. The St Louis City SC app features stories about Mill Creek Valley, where fans can learn how the current landscape represents the row houses that made up the vibrant community. On the stadium grounds there are black granite outlines of the three homes that stood there. The stadium also incorporates plaques into the landscape as hedgerows representing homes and within the landscape is the address of each home. Because St Louis is a predominantly Black city .Collier says it’s important to share the history of the neighborhood and also include the community in what St Louis City SC is up to off the pitch. The nascent club is eager to engage the next generation about career opportunities within the sport. The MLS is the youngest and most diverse sports league in the country and St Louis City want to reflect that on every level. Before the stadium opened, the club had the most participation of African Americans on any major project in the city of St Louis. The club also sourced staff from the local workforce to boost economic development in Black and Brown communities. Collier says that’s just the beginning as they continue to hire ahead of the official start of play in March 2023. In addition to the greenways, the Brickline connecting St Louis will be used as a catalyst for growth and partnership. Great Rivers Greenway and the Brickline Greenway is focused on community engagement based on equity and economic development, says Susan Trautman, CEO of Great Rivers Greenway. The vision for the Brickline Greenway is 20 miles of pathways that connects 17 neighborhoods including Forest Park, Gateway Arch National Park, Fairground Park and Tower Grove Park. While the area along Mill Creek is largely developed, GRG is partnering with several organizations in an equity economic development working group with goals centered around people, power, places and systems. Trautman says it was essential that the working group receive input from the community about how to revitalize the areas of disinvestment in North St Louis. “It’s about using the community voice to make decisions about how land and real estate is developed,” Trautman says. “And working in tandem with our nonprofit partners we will have an equity economic director who encourage and support development that is driven by community need adjacent to the greenway.” GRG recently released an RFQ for design to build the Brickline North section. The organization then held a mixer to allow small businesses owned by people of color to become part of the major design team effort. GRG is focused on design and construction in the North St Louis area where “there is not as much opportunity”. and real estate development is focused on the 500ft to quarter-mile perimeter of the Brickline, where economic development is more likely to occur. “The biggest part of making sure people in the community are engaged is educating them on how they can be engaged and introducing them to opportunities where maybe they are a sub consultant to start so maybe they can grow their business,” Trautman says. From Davis’ artwork to economic initiatives, St Louis City SC is striving to be a new spirit in St Louis through the power of sport. And for the club, acknowledging the past is part of building for a better future. Collier says the monument dedicated to the story of Mill Creek Valley goes beyond the fan experience, but it pushed St Louis in the middle of a national conversation. “Not only do we get to educate St Louisans, we get to educate the world,” Collier says. “But this is going to be a national monument in St Louis and there’s nothing like this in sports.”",Sport/Football,St Louis City SC looks to MLS future by remembering ‘hard truths of past’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/st-louis-city-sc-mill-creek-valley
3/16/2022,"On Saturday morning, I woke up in my home in Poland to a call from an unknown number. The woman on the line said she had a message from my mother in Mariupol, and my heart stopped beating for a moment: my mum is alive. Knowing this is my new definition of happiness. For the past seven years I have made sure my mobile ringer is on before going to sleep, a simple rule I follow just in case my mum calls. But since the start of March, there has been no electricity in that city, and I haven’t heard her voice. This call was a true miracle – after 10 long days, to have confirmation that my mum is still alive. The woman read a letter from her describing the situation in the city. A minute was enough to understand that there’s a humanitarian disaster there already, and every hour counts. The information blackout in Mariupol gives them no hope – my mum was begging me to let the world know they have nothing. In that moment I realised how desperate it is: every night sitting in the full darkness, where the only source of light is a flash from bomb or shell, and all the while thinking you are abandoned and forgotten by the world. I last heard from her and others early in the invasion. Few people wanted to risk leaving the city. It takes about 28 hours from Mariupol to Lviv on the train. People felt that the whole country was on fire and the train was too dangerous. On 3 March it was announced that the city was cut off from the world; the railway track had been destroyed in the night. Official evacuation plans were announced on 5 March, but in the time since only a few private cars have managed to leave the city – probably only a few hundred citizens, out of a city of more than 400,000 people. Now that the city is cut off, the shortages are horrible – electricity, water, gas, the mobile network. Every day something becomes unavailable. Grocery stores turned cash-only but still quickly ran out of stock. In every war there are looters, and desperate hungry people who have lost their human side through fear are emptying and destroying shops across the city. You hear of people taking wooden furniture to make fires. There really were people cooking over these fires, or melting snow to get water. But this wasn’t widespread or long-lasting. Mainly it is too risky to be outside. Air attacks are constant – the city doesn’t have the same air defences as Kyiv. The few bomb shelters available are packed with people. There are firefights in the street. It can be cold at night, -8C (17.6F), and with heating and medical care unavailable, anything that befalls a person could kill – slower than the bombs, but just as surely. The main cemetery is located outside the city in a small village – it’s impossible to get there now. This is why people are buried in their own yards, or in mass graves. The city administration has informed people that they do not identify bodies in these graves. That is my newest fear: not just to lose someone I love, but not even to be able to cry at their grave. The president has said a convoy of aid could reach the city today. But simple math shows that 100 tonnes of aid works out to just about 300 grams per person. Is it enough? Will it reach people who are terrified in basements, who haven’t seen sunlight for days? People are still praying for the convoy to reach the city so they can be evacuated by its buses. Everyone I know dreams of that miracle. I am afraid to see a picture of the thousands of people left over – to evacuate even a third of the city would take weeks. And for thousands, the question is whether they can go or not. Many have lost their homes and belongings; many have nowhere they could go. Since 2014, Mariupol – which is in eastern Ukraine in the Donetsk region – has been the city that resisted. It built connections to the wider world and blossomed: new roads, a restored city centre, modernised hospitals, big festivals. It looked like a new chapter in our history. When I was last there in October 2021, it was modern, clean. I went to the pier and watched the seagulls blow like so many kites in the wind. It reminded me how I told my friends in Poland about the city: a place where the trollybus can take you down to the beach, and the water is warm like milk. After all the heartbreaking stories and all the pain Mariupol is going through, my biggest dream is to witness the day it can be that other city again. I hoped to see my mum there in May of this year and take her to the pier. I still hope to make that happen. Gordana Kruuti is originally from Mariupol.

3/16/2022,"On one level, it was a statement of the obvious from Harry Kane. The Tottenham striker sat down with Sky Sports before his team’s Premier League game at Brighton on Wednesday night and, among other things, said he wanted to play Champions League football. Context, though, is everything. This is Kane, the 28-year-old England captain, who said the same thing leading up to last summer, when he attempted to leave a club that could not offer him action in Europe’s elite competition for one that certainly could – and plenty else, besides. Kane did not get a move to Manchester City and it is unclear whether the Premier League champions would push for him again at the end of this season – and not only because they found the negotiations so tortuous last time out. Were Kane to have had a release clause in his Spurs contract, which expires in June 2024, like, say, Jack Grealish did in his deal at Aston Villa, the situation would have been different. Maybe it still can be. It is understood that the City hierarchy told Kane’s people to renegotiate with Spurs and get something written in – however difficult that may be. But there is nothing at the moment and so there we are and here we are, with Kane looking at his team’s final 11 matches of the league season and hoping to drive a sequence that ends with them in the top four. “Personally, you want to be in the best competitions in the world,” Kane told Sky. “My focus is on this year. Getting top four is the most important goal for us now. If we can get on a run, this is more than possible. That’s all I can control and that’s all the manager can control as well. Let’s see where we end up.” There is one certainty. Kane will give everything to help his boyhood club back into the Champions League. But, beyond that, there is nothing and, in the event that Spurs fall short, it is easy to see another summer saga involving Kane. The drums have started to beat, Kane’s reminder about where he wants to be coming as Antonio Conte faced familiar but insistent questions on Tuesday lunchtime about the future of his talisman. The Spurs manager was asked directly on two occasions whether the club needed to finish in the Champions League places to persuade Kane not to look elsewhere and there were further, more lateral attempts to get him to engage with the topic. Conte’s stance was exactly the same as that of Kane. The focus is on the remaining games. And then we will see. “In this moment, it is not important to speak about the future,” Conte said. “It is important to see the present because the present is more important. We have to try to get the best in these 11 games and then we will see. It is important to be focused on the present and we have a lot of time to sit around the table and then to speak about everything. “At the end of the season – or [just] before then – everyone has to speak about their own vision. I speak about my vision, the club will speak about theirs, [Fabio] Paratici [the managing director of football] will speak about his and then we will see. Now it is too early. For sure, there will be a moment when we will go to take decisions.” Conte’s vision remains clear. He wants to be able to compete and win trophies. He even suggested that he only needed to feel “one per cent to win the title or a trophy in which we participate” for him to have something to get behind, although, as ever, there was a threat. “I stop if the vision of someone is not the same,” Conte said. It is doubtful whether Conte’s future beyond the summer has ever not been a thing since his arrival at Spurs last November. He is contracted to June 2023, albeit there is an option to extend. But what happens next with Kane is set to be debated with increasing ferocity. The questions will not go away, even if Spurs have shown that, with Kane’s years of contract working on their side, they will not be pushed around. There is the sense that Kane may have missed the boat with City. They are resolved to sign a centre-forward this summer to help Pep Guardiola in what the club expect will be his final season with them; his deal runs out at the end of it. But it would be as much a move for the longer term and the manager after Guardiola, who may rely more on a specialist No 9. Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland – at 21 years old, the coming star – has been linked heavily to City. What about Manchester United, who have Mauricio Pochettino on the shortlist to become their next permanent manager? Pochettino worked productively with Kane when he was in charge at Spurs. Then again United are hardly assured of Champions League football next season. Kane and Conte talked about how they feel that Spurs are getting better, with the former giving plenty of credit to the latter. “I definitely feel like I’m improving and the team is with Antonio,” Kane said. “That motivates you to be even better. Hopefully we can end the season and give the top four a real go.” Then we will see.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane’s Champions League aims loom over Spurs’ summer once again,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/harry-kanes-champions-league-aims-loom-over-spurs-summer-once-again
3/16/2022,"Global powers have inched closer to an agreement to waive patents for Covid-19 vaccines, a move that would allow for cheaper generic versions to be manufactured and distributed among developing nations faster. A leaked document, seen by the Guardian, reveals details of a compromise struck between the United States, the European Union, India and South Africa that would end a deadlock over an intellectual property waiver, 18 months after the proposal was first taken to the World Trade Organization. The document detailing the compromise position suggests the negotiated form of the waiver has veered substantially away from the initial proposal first raised by India and South Africa in October 2020, which sought to suspend patents for successful Covid vaccines, treatments and diagnostics – invented by pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer and Moderna – for the duration of the pandemic. The document details a tentative proposal that would still need final agreement from the four negotiators, as well as from all WTO member nations, to be passed. If passed, the compromised version of the waiver will see only patents for Covid-19 vaccines suspended for either three or five years, and means that treatment and testing formulas will still be subject to intellectual property protections. It would only apply to developing WTO member countries that exported less than 10% of world exports of Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2021, and for those countries would include ingredients and processes necessary for the vaccines’ manufacturing. Additionally, it does not cover technology transfer and trade secrets – something that human rights and development advocates believe will slow down developing nations’ vaccine production. The leaked draft of the agreement states that, if passed at the WTO, member nations will discuss extending the intellectual property waiver to testing and treatment technologies in six months’ time. Because of the WTO’s consensus-based system, as opposed to a majority voting system, one dissenting vote can bring down a proposal. More than 100 mostly lower and middle income nations initially supported the proposal put by India and South Africa. The EU has been one of the last holdouts not to back the plan, while the US shifted its position in May to support waiving patents for vaccines only. Several wealthier nations that had not earlier expressed support for the waiver, including New Zealand and Australia, followed the US shift. Earlier, the US Trade Representative Office spokesperson, Adam Hodge, said that informal discussions between the US, EU, India and South Africa had led to the compromise. “The difficult and protracted process has resulted in a compromise outcome that offers the most promising path toward achieving a concrete and meaningful outcome,” Hodge said. Human rights groups have cautiously welcomed news of the compromise but have expressed disappointment that the negotiated position does not include treatments and diagnostic technologies. Australian Fair Trade & Investment Network convener, Dr Patricia Ranald, welcomed “the admission that WTO rules need to change”. “But these are baby steps which still protect the interests of pharmaceutical companies rather than saving lives. Three million have died since the Omicron variant, and millions more will die unless the Australian and other governments insist on a full waiver for vaccines, tests and treatments,” Ranald said. Amnesty International Australia’s Ry Atkinson said “this compromise is an acknowledgment that business as usual isn’t going to get us out of this crisis”. However, Atkinson said “the reality is that it [the negotiated proposal] doesn’t go far enough”. “We need a waiver that includes technology transfers and treatments, as the co-sponsors of the original waiver intended. Governments advocating for anything less are selling the world short,” he said. Last week, an open letter signed by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the actor Charlize Theron and the former British prime minister Gordon Brown singled out the UK, EU and Switzerland for continuing to block the waiver on lifting intellectual property rules. About 4% of people in low-income countries have had two vaccine doses, according to Amnesty International. The World Health Organization director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has previously labelled vaccine licensing rules and distribution limits a “catastrophic moral failure”. Several pharmaceutical companies across the world which have expressed an interest in making Covid-19 vaccines have cited production permission as a barrier.",News/Society,Global powers inch closer to agreement to waive Covid vaccine patents,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/global-powers-inch-closer-to-agreement-to-waive-covid-vaccine-patents
