3/10/2022,"On Monday's front page, The New York Times published a photo of a woman and her two children dead on the streets of Irpin, near Kyiv. It’s terrifying and unimaginably sad. It’s also essential to our understanding of what’s going on in Ukraine. In the photo, Ukrainian soldiers work to try to save a man, identified as a friend of the family, who lay beside them. The four had been hit by a mortar as they tried to escape Irpin. Now, more than ever, we should be grateful for the chance to see it. Journalist Lynsey Addario took the photo and wrote about the attack. The story includes this description: “Their luggage, a blue roller suitcase and some backpacks, was scattered about, along with a green carrying case for a small dog that was barking.” More: Defiant Zelenskyy vows Ukraine will 'not give up, will fight to the end' as casualties continue to mount: Live updates We see three of the four faces, a scene so horrific that it seems surreal, too tragic to be true. As awful as it is to see this, it’s those backpacks and bags that ground the scene in reality. Every parent has watched their child trudge off to school with a backpack over their shoulders. Seeing the same item in a vastly different context is, among all the other adjectives you can think of, heartbreaking. It’s also important. And it should be seen. It is a reminder of the atrocities happening in Ukraine after Russia’s unprovoked invasion. And of their cost. These are people— neighbors, friends, children — and they are dying. If it takes a photo that is difficult to look at and difficult to process to pound that point home, to move this story beyond just the numbers, then so be it. Now, there is a discussion to be had about how much of this anyone should expose themselves to. There is no pat answer; everyone’s level of tolerance is different. But at least we are able to make that choice for ourselves. That choice is now unavailable to almost anyone living in Russia. On Friday, Russia passed a law that makes publishing anything authorities consider false information – “fake news” in the parlance of a previous American presidential administration – punishable by fines and up to 15 years in prison. What Russian authorities consider fake news, of course, has nothing to do with the truth. It has everything to do with selling the necessity of an unnecessary war to its citizens, who are increasingly cut off from accurate reporting. For instance, the law made it it illegal to refer to the war in Ukraine as, well, a war. “Special military operation” is the preferred term. Media companies have already adjusted their coverage, not out of protest but fear for the safety of their journalists. CNN has said it will stop broadcasting in Russia. The BBC and Bloomberg News have temporarily suspended the work of their journalists there. (On Tuesday the BBC reversed its decision.) ABC and CBS are temporarily ceasing broadcasting from Russia. The New York Times announced Tuesday that it was pulling its journalists from the country. The list goes on. The country has also banned Facebook, further cutting its people off from information. Donald Trump regularly attacked the media in a nonstop disinformation campaign to try to discredit journalists who didn’t show him what he considered proper fealty. Of all the negative influence left in his wake, this may be the most dangerous. Now American politicians bluster constantly about fake news, which in most cases is legitimate news they dislike. Some openly muse about getting rid of journalists who dare report on them truthfully. Attacking the media is part of the conservative playbook, and not just a page at the back. It’s right up there in the front. What’s going on in Russia as it tries to justify its attack on Ukraine should be chilling to anyone who values freedom, no matter what their politics. It’s probably too much to think that what’s going on there – and what isn’t going on; namely, independent reporting that is crucial to the health and survival of any country – will serve as a warning to the people here who need it most. But it should. The truth, no matter how unpleasant, no matter how horrifying, no matter how heartbreaking, is essential. Look at the backpacks in the New York Times photo. Look at the faces. Everyone should see them. Even people – especially people – in Russia. And that isn't going to happen. The truth hurts. That’s why it’s so important.

3/10/2022,"Fox News National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin appeared on Hannity Wednesday where she addressed recent Russian propaganda claiming that the U.S. has secret bioweapon labs in Ukraine. “In terms of Ukraine’s biolabs, which have come under scrutiny tonight,” Griffin said, “those are Soviet-era biolabs that the U.S. has been engaged [with] since 2005 in trying to help Ukraine convert the research facilities safely.” In pointing out that the U.S. has been working with these labs since 2005, she was referencing the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2005. There has been this type of cooperation in other former Soviet states going back to the early ’90s, and Griffin gave an example of some of the work that’s been done. “In Uzbekistan, for instance,” Griffin said, “the United States eliminated nearly 12 tons of weaponized anthrax from an island in the Aral Sea in 2001.” Griffin reiterated the concern that U.S. officials have that Russia is only making these claims as a pretext to their own use of these types of weapons as their invasion of Ukraine has not gone as planned. Russia has used chemical weapons on civilians in Syria in the past. “White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Moscow’s talk today about these biolabs has led to concern by U.S. intelligence,” Griffin said, “that Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine to create a false flag operation using them.” The U.S. has been very open about its involvement there.
Jennifer Griffin Griffin’s reporting on the Russian claim stood in sharp contrast to what opinion host Tucker Carlson said on his show an hour earlier. Carlson, who has been accused of pushing Russian propaganda on multiple occasions, took the admission by Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland in a hearing on Tuesday that there are biological research labs in Ukraine as an admission of guilt. Carlson not only played a clip of a Russian official making the claim, but went on to propagate it himself. “Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe,” Carlson said. “It’s hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We’re assuming these weren’t pharmaceutical labs. Probably not developing new leukemia drugs. From your answer, Victoria Nuland, we would assume, because you all but said it, there’s a military application of this research. They’re working on bioweapons.” But Griffin pointed out that U.S. involvement with these labs is neither new nor secret. “It is a long program that has existed, where the Pentagon has partnered with these biolabs,” Griffin said, adding, “The U.S. has been very open about its involvement there with that. But what Russia does is they take that information, distort it, turn it around and turn it into disinformation.” Hannity airs weeknights at 9 p.m. on Fox News Channel.

3/10/2022,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Tuesday: Russian forces mostly still intact Nearly all Russian forces arrayed at the Ukrainian border for the invasion have now gone in, according to the official. Despite losing troops, ground vehicles and aircraft in the fighting, the official estimated these forces remain roughly 95% intact. MORE: Russia-Ukraine live updates: Russia claims it will not send in conscripted soldiers Russian ground efforts stalled in the north Russian troops approaching Kyiv have made little progress in recent days, according to the official. ""We continue to see Ukrainian resistance efforts slow down the Russians, particularly in the north,"" the official said. Another factor is that ""they still seem to be plagued by logistics and sustainment challenges,"" including fuel and food shortages, the official said. The Pentagon also continues to see fighting and resistance against the Russian advance in the northern cities of Chernihiv and Kharkiv. The farthest the main Russian force heading to Kyiv seems to have been able to reach is Hostomel Airport, a site of intense combat some 20 miles northwest of the city. But their intent is clear, the official said: ""We still have every reason to assess that their effort is to encircle and force the surrender of Kiev."" A new Russian approach emerges Further out than those advance troops, a Russian push toward the capital is emerging in the northeast, just above the town of Sumy, the official said. These troops are roughly 37 miles from Kyiv. Russians try to ""sow fear and confusion"" in the city While the main invading force has not reached Kyiv, the official was in ""no position to refute"" reports of minor, isolated skirmishes between Russian ""reconnaissance elements"" and Ukrainian forces inside the city. ""We think that these reports of street fighting in Kyiv are really the result of their efforts to sow fear and confusion and and try to set the stage for what could be coming later,"" the official said. MORE: Amid war in Ukraine, US Marine detained by Russia faces urgent health needs Strikes on civilians continue Russian air and missile attacks are increasing as their ground effort has been frustrated, according to the official. ""Whether intentionally or not, they're hitting military and government infrastructure as well as residential areas and civilian targets,"" the official said. Russians see more success in the south Russian troops advancing to the northwest out of Crimea are about 25 miles from Mykolayiv, the official said. The official noted that while there is speculation that the move on Mykolayiv is meant to put troops in position to attack the port city of Odessa from the north as amphibious troops assault from the coast, ""we don't see any evidence of amphibious landings"" at this point. On the Sea of Azov coast, Russian forces have isolated Mariupol and continue to bombard it with long-range attacks. Thousands of troops put ashore in an amphibious landing on the second day of the invasion are approaching the city from the southwest as more troops push down from Donetsk.

U.S.-Russia deconfliction line in working order Last week Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced it had set up a ""deconfliction line"" with Russia to ""reduce the chances of miscalculations and try to bring down the tensions as that contested airspace over Ukraine now bumps up against NATO airspace."" The senior defense official said that as of Tuesday, the two countries have used the line about a dozen times, but so far only for test calls to make sure ""somebody's picking up on the other end.""

3/10/2022,"By Sultan Anshori KUTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - When Russian tourist Konstantin Ivanov tried to withdraw money from his home bank account at a cash machine on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, the transaction was blocked. Unprecedented sanctions against Russia's banks over its invasion of Ukraine are taking a toll on its citizens overseas, who have been left scrambling to find cash or turn to crypto transactions to get by. ""This has created a huge problem for us. We have been left completely stripped of our finances - it's like they have been completely frozen and we cannot use them at all over here,"" said Ivanov, 27, adding that he might have to look for a job in Indonesia. Bali is a popular holiday destination with Russian tourists, who flocked to the island by the tens of thousands before the pandemic and were among the first to return when borders partially reopened last year. About 1,150 Russians entered Indonesia in January 2022, according to data from the statistics bureau. Rifki Saldi Yanto, the manager of a local cafe, said he had noticed a decline in Russian customers in recent days and many now pay with cash instead of credit card. Russia's embassy in Jakarta said it was providing information and assistance to any citizen who faced problems. Denis Tetiushin, an embassy spokesperson, said Russia's Pochta Bank was now offering a virtual card using China's UnionPay system instead of Visa or Mastercard. ""It's free of charge and people may open it wherever they are,"" he said in a text message. Meanwhile more than 7,000 Russians were stranded in Thailand, another popular beach destination because of flight cancellations, a rouble currency in free-fall and payment issues. [L3N2VB1KZ] Russia's economy is facing its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, after western countries moved in recent days to isolate it from the global financial system. International payments system SWIFT has disconnected several Russian banks from its network, while Visa and Mastercard said they were blocking overseas use of their cards issued by Russian banks from March 9.
