2/5/2022,"Who speaks for Israel? Rightwing lobby groups in Washington and US politicians would have Americans believe that it is them – and not Israel’s own former prime ministers and others who actually live in the Jewish state. Earlier this week Amnesty International released a report making a 280-page case that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians constitutes apartheid. The response in the US was a wave of orchestrated outrage – outrage that not only denies what many prominent Israelis say is true but, in effect, denies their right to say it.  A joint statement by American groups that claim to be pro-Israel – including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), a powerful rightwing lobby organisation – accused Amnesty of seeking to “demonize and delegitimize the Jewish and democratic State of Israel”, a formulation frequently used to imply antisemitism. Groups that made little criticism of Israel’s military collaboration with South Africa’s white minority regime now profess concern that Amnesty’s report diminishes the suffering of black Africans under apartheid. As the Guardian’s correspondent in Jerusalem during the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s, the second intifada, after covering the end of white rule in South Africa, I was struck by how frequently prominent Israelis drew comparisons between the occupation and apartheid. I also noticed how hard pro-Israel groups in the US fought to delegitimize any such discussion. Yet Amnesty explicitly said that it is not drawing direct parallels with the old South Africa. Its report accuses Israel of crimes against humanity under international laws, including the 1973 Apartheid Convention and the 1998 Rome statute of the international criminal court, which defines apartheid as systematic racial domination. That did not stop American politicians from piling in with accusations that Amnesty “hates Israel”, although not always to the best effect. The Republican senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas exposed his tenuous grasp on the situation by denouncing the human rights group for “attacking a free democracy where Jews, Christians, and Muslims live in peace”. If the critics of the report have read it at all, they rarely engage with its detailing of Israel’s system of military rule, segregation and forced removals that treats Palestinians as an inferior racial group. Instead critics are more focused on smearing Amnesty. A Wall Street Journal editorial, ignoring the report’s substance, called it a “libel” against Israel and claimed that Amnesty is in the company of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran because the human rights group “all but says the Jewish state shouldn’t exist”. For those charges to stand up, you have to believe Israel has been led by antisemites who hate their own country. In smearing those who lay out a reasoned case that Israel is guilty of apartheid under international law, American critics are conveniently sidestepping years of damning judgments by Israeli leaders. As Yossi Sarid, a former Israeli cabinet minister, ex-leader of the opposition, and member of the Knesset for 32 years, put it in 2008: “What acts like apartheid, is run like apartheid and harasses like apartheid, is not a duck – it is apartheid.” Leading Israeli politicians have warned for years that their country was sliding into apartheid. They include two former prime ministers, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, who can hardly be dismissed as antisemites or hating Israel. “As long as in this territory west of the Jordan river there is only one political entity called Israel it is going to be either non-Jewish or non-democratic,” Barak said in 2010. “If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state.” Israel’s former attorney general, Michael Ben-Yair, was even clearer. “We established an apartheid regime in the occupied territories immediately following their capture. That oppressive regime exists to this day,” he said in 2002. Ami Ayalon, the former head of Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence service, has said his country has “apartheid characteristics”. Shulamit Aloni, the second woman to serve as an Israeli cabinet minister after Golda Meir, and Alon Liel, Israel’s former ambassador to South Africa, both told me that their country practices a form of apartheid. Israel’s leading human rights group, B’Tselem, published a groundbreaking report last year that described “a regime of Jewish supremacy” over Palestinians that amounted to apartheid. Another Israeli group, Yesh Din, gave a legal opinion that “the crime against humanity of apartheid is being committed in the West Bank”. The reckoning is not confined to the political class. “The cancer today is apartheid in the West Bank,” AB Yehoshua, one of Israel’s greatest living writers, said in 2020. “This apartheid is digging more and more deeply into Israeli society and impacting Israel’s humanity.” Those views may be disputed by many in Israel, even a majority. But Aipac and other US groups – which have spent years shoring up support in America for rightwing Israeli governments intent on maintaining their particular form of apartheid – are not concerned about truth. Hardline pro-Israel groups are lashing out now in fear that the narrative in America is finally shifting. Americans no longer uncritically accept the idea that Israel is desperate for peace and that the occupation is temporary. More and more Americans now see the system Israel has constructed as oppressive and its governments as disingenuous. Perhaps most worryingly for the Israeli government’s apologists, an increasing number of Jewish Americans share that judgment. A survey of Jewish voters in the US last year found that 25% agreed that “Israel is an apartheid state”. The days of rightwing apologists for Israel imposing their false narrative may finally be numbered.

2/5/2022,"Lauren Smith-Fields was a beautiful young woman, a former high school track star who was studying to become a physical therapist. She was active on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, posting pictures and videos of herself looking healthy and glamorous. She did not use drugs, say her family members, whose grief over her untimely death is as apparent as the sense that something is missing from the story of her demise, on December 12, at age 23. Her family does not believe that Smith-Fields died of an accidental overdose – as the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has said – and one can’t blame them for doubting this ruling. Smith-Fields’s friends and family have publicly wondered if racism may explain why the Bridgeport police were allegedly so careless in their investigation of the scene, saying that detectives failed to collect vital evidence, notify Smith-Fields’s family of her death, or rigorously investigate the last person known to have been in her company – the white man she met earlier that evening on a Bumble date. This wouldn’t be the first time that someone had been drugged on a dating app date – in fact, it’s a serious problem that has gone largely underreported.  While there have been many stories of people being slipped drugs by their dating site matches going back years, this dangerous phenomenon has not made its way into the broader narrative of online dating culture. Just last week a 43-year-old man in Perth, Australia, was charged with drugging and raping two women in their twenties he met on a sugar daddy dating site, allegedly putting ketamine in their drinks before sexually assaulting them. In 2019, a Calgary anesthesiologist, Barry Wollach, was convicted of raping a woman he met on Bumble, who suspected she had been drugged, feeling “woozy” after having had dinner with him. (Wollach was convicted of rape though the judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to say that he had also drugged the victim. Wollach denied both accusations.) Common date rape drugs such as Rohypnol are usually odorless, colorless, and tasteless, and leave the body quickly, so are hard to detect. But cases with medical evidence continually crop up in the news. In 2021, for example, a woman in British Columbia reported feeling so nauseous after a Tinder date that she went to a hospital, where she was given a drug test that showed MDMA and methamphetamine in her system, substances she had not knowingly ingested. As of now there is no proof that Smith-Fields was drugged by her Bumble date, or anyone else. But the lethal mixture in her system was powerful and strange – the toxicology report showed fentanyl, an opioid; promethazine and hydroxyzine, antihistamines that can be used as sedatives; and alcohol (her date told police that he and Smith-Fields had been drinking tequila) – raising questions about why a young woman with no known history of drug abuse would have such a varied mixture of substances in her system. The lawyer for Smith-Fields’s family, Darnell Crosland, told Bridgeport station WTNH: “Now to find out that all of these substances are in their daughter’s body that basically took her life, they’re so angry right now. This looks further like a manslaughter.” On January 25, after weeks of activism by her family and others, and a tweet from Cardi B (which the family credited with helping raise awareness), Bridgeport police opened a criminal investigation. Whether #justiceforlauren will become a reality remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Bumble has issued a statement saying that the “physical and emotional safety of our community is of paramount importance. We investigate member complaints and take swift, decisive action against any members who do not meet our standards.” While Bumble may be taking “swift, decisive action” in this high-profile case, they have not always been so quick to come to users’ aid. In 2020, ProPublica reported that the company failed to respond to a user’s complaint of being sexually assaulted and that her alleged attacker’s profile continued to appear on the app. The presence of sexual offenders on dating apps is another disturbing problem. In 2020, Bumble and other popular dating services became the focus of a House subcommittee investigation into sex offenders and minors using their services. It has become increasingly clear that the online dating industry is in need of regulation, and that the controversial Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 needs to be amended. Section 230 grants internet companies immunity from liability in cases of third-party wrongdoing – which means that, even if it were to be proved that someone had died after being drugged by a dating app match, her family could not sue the company. Such protection from civil suits diminishes companies’ impetus to protect their users. Smith-Fields’s family is suing the Bridgeport police department, which “has been racially insensitive to this family and has treated this family with no respect and has violated their civil rights,” according to their notice of claim. “They have failed to investigate this matter and they refuse to view the last person with Lauren Smith-Fields before she died as a person of interest.” Smith-Fields’s brother, Lakeem Jetter, told NBC Connecticut that when he asked a police officer involved in the case about his sister’s Bumble date, “He said he was a very nice guy and they weren’t looking into him anymore. It was almost like he was sticking up for him and it seemed weird to hear that from a detective.” On January 31, Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim said that two detectives involved in the case have been placed on administrative leave and are being investigated by the Bridgeport police department’s internal affairs office.

2/5/2022,"Hidden behind the Andes in a quiet corner of South America, a formidable generation of former student leaders are putting together one of the world’s most exciting progressive movements. On 11 March, Gabriel Boric, 35, a tattooed leftist with a steely resolve to reform Chile from the bottom up, will become the country’s youngest ever president – and his green agenda is echoing across the world as time ticks away on an impending climate catastrophe.  “It is so exciting to see what these young people have done,” says Maisa Rojas, 49, a renowned Chilean climate scientist who has been named environment minister in a cabinet including several of Boric’s student protest generation. “These people were university leaders just 10 years ago, but they’ve brought a completely fresh perspective to the challenges of the 21st century, including climate change.” On 24 January, Boric named a female-majority cabinet for the first time in Chile’s history. Rojas, one of 14 women among the 24 ministers, is a prominent academic at the University of Chile, where she first studied physics in the 1990s, and the director of the country’s interdisciplinary Centre for Climate and Resilience Research. She holds a PhD in atmospheric physics from Lincoln College, Oxford, and was one of the authors of August 2021’s ominous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which warned that big climate changes, caused by human activity, were now inevitable and irreversible. But now, after a distinguished career in academia, Rojas will lead the way on Boric’s ambitious promise to construct a green, sustainable and resilient future for Chile. “I think there’s a lot of space for Chile to become a leader in the fight against climate change,” she says, “I would love to be able convince other countries that ambitiously tackling climate change is in their best interests.” While international leadership would be vitally important in a region noted for its climate pariahs, led by the notorious Brazilian president, Jaír Bolsonaro, Chile’s extraordinary variety of landscapes and climates also make the country uniquely vulnerable to climate change at home, with prolonged droughts increasingly common. From the world’s driest desert, Atacama, in the north of the country, down through the arid valleys of central Chile to Patagonia’s dramatic fjords and glaciers, mining, forestry, agriculture and fisheries dominate a raw material-led economy that is among South America’s strongest. And just as Rojas speaks calmly and methodically about the climate crisis, she is clear in linking the health of the planet to the development models that have brought it to the brink. “Global warming is a symptom of the way that our civilization has developed over the 200 years since the Industrial Revolution,” she says. “That has had two consequences: one is obviously the degradation of our physical environment, but the other is structural inequality which, in the case of Chile, is the basis of the social unrest that started in 2019 – and led to the writing of the new constitution.” In October 2019, vast, era-defining anti-inequality protests exploded in Chile, leading party leaders to sign an accord to work towards replacing the current constitution, which was drafted under General Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship (1973-1990). The assembly which was convened to write the new constitution has since passed a resolution declaring that the process is taking place in the context of a climate emergency. Elsewhere, Chile has committed to net zero emissions by 2050 as part of ambitious climate targets. In June last year, plentiful solar and wind potential led the lower house of congress to approve a bill which would bring forward a ban on the installation of new coal-fired power plants from 2040 to 2025. The senate is yet to rule on the law, which Rojas says is an absolute priority. “When we address climate change, it’s not just an environmental issue,” she says. “We need to look at structural elements of our society, which also means changing our development pathway.” “The narrative of economic growth in opposition to environmental protection is a false dichotomy that belongs in the 20th century – I’m not saying that we will transform Chile into one big national park without any industries, but we certainly have to do things differently.” Rojas is measured and thoughtful as she speaks, and she freely admits that she isn’t a natural politician. “It feels strange to be a climate scientist in the world of politics, I definitely feel a bit out of place,” she says. “But we definitely need both politicians and experts to be involved in this process. Just because I am an expert, it does not mean that I will make a better minister than someone who is a politician.” Rojas was pushed towards politics reluctantly at first. After the first round of Chile’s presidential election in November, a very different future seemed to lie in wait when José Antonio Kast, a conservative who made a point of rejecting and minimising the climate crisis, beat Boric by two percentage points. “I was heartbroken and left in total shock,” she remembers, “I said at the time, I cannot just stay in my comfort zone in academia now – I have to get involved.” Alongside a number of concerned scientists, Rojas wrote a letter to the British scientific journal Nature to express concern over a climate change denier winning Chile’s election. Soon afterwards, she was inducted into Boric’s campaign team as environmental spokesperson, before the he stormed to victory in December’s runoff, winning more votes in the process than any presidential candidate in Chile’s history. Although this is Rojas’s first political position, she has led international climate efforts in the past and was appointed coordinator of the Cop25 summit’s scientific advisory committee when Chile was due to host the conference in 2019. Although it was eventually moved to Madrid as unrest exploded in Chile, Rojas says the role was a wake-up call that helped her understand the dynamics of top-table politics, as well as the private sector – where she had no experience – and the various branches of government. She also says it signalled a turning point for the narrative surrounding the climate crisis. “Climate change really became front page news in 2019 with the Cop25,” she says. “It stopped being something that would occur at the end of the century and might harm polar bears in the Arctic.” But at Cop26 in Glasgow last November, as she worked with the team on the annual report on the climate crisis, Rojas felt an unfamiliar feeling. “For the first time in my life I felt something like ‘eco-anxiety’ – I was really worried about what was going on,” she says. Rojas says she is still trying to work out how she will manage expectations and adhere to the promises made during the campaign, saying that a “ratchet” mechanism, in which goals are set and made more ambitious periodically, could be preferable. “The expectations are so high,” she says of the incoming Boric government, which is still riding a wave of optimism ahead of its inauguration. “We all know that politics is the art of the possible, but I am confident we can deliver.”",News/World news,‘We need politicians and experts’: how Chile is putting the climate crisis first,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/we-need-politicians-and-experts-maisa-rojas-how-chile-putting-climate-crisis-first
2/5/2022,"At this time of year, all I can think about is light. My houseplants are similarly obsessed: a few of them are challenging each other to do the best Leaning Tower of Pisa impression. I can torture them no longer, so I’ve changed a few lightbulbs, added a few timers and now, even in my darkest corners, life grows. Once upon a time, winter in homes that struggle for light meant unhappy, stunted plants. But the introduction of cheap, LED lights has meant this is rapidly changing. Now even the darkest basement flat or north-facing room looking on to a brick wall can have a jungle of growth. Plants utilise a wide range of the light spectrum, from far red to green and far blue; these affect the plants’ growth and habit in different ways. For instance, far-red light can trigger flowering, while far-blue and ultraviolet will influence root and leaf growth. For seedlings and young veg, any number of cheap LED grow lights offer red and blue light, and will give you wonderfully bushy little plants (try urbanplantgrowers.co.uk). The neon-pink glow from these lights is a little challenging, but if you put your whole set-up in a cupboard, you’re not exactly going to notice that.  I use these lights to supplement the seedlings growing on my kitchen windowsill. It’s south-west facing, so in the day it’s bright enough to not need the lights, but by using a timer, I can extend the daylight. I supplement the light from 6am and again around 4pm for a couple of hours and it makes a huge difference to the growth. If pink isn’t your cup of tea, there are a number of LED lights that offer 4,000-Kelvin white light. This includes the green spectrum, which means you get a brilliant white that works for your home and also offers a balanced spectrum for plant growth. These bulbs are bright, so they’re not exactly suitable for the main ceiling light – unless you want to be blinded. But they are good in pendant, clamp and desk-top lamps, where you can direct the light at your plants. LEDs are useful, too, because they won’t get too hot and scorch young growth. Plus, they have a long life – of around 60,000 hours. A traditional bulb-shaped LED light (try uk.rs-online.com) is suitable for houseplants and seedlings, and wouldn’t look out of place in an open pendant lampshade. If the aesthetic of the bulb doesn’t matter much to you, try an LED bulb from Grow London (londongrow.com). It has a built-in timer (offering a 15-hours-on, nine-hours-off timetable), which means you don’t have to remember to switch the lights on and off.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The secret to bringing droopy houseplants back to life?

2/5/2022,"When the water company executive arrived, John Barker presented him with a bucket of dead fish. It was September 2020. Barker was furious. The fish came from the River Ems, which winds for six miles from Stoughton, West Sussex, to Chichester Harbour. Barker, 68, a retired environmental campaigner, owns a sustainable farm in the village of Westbourne. The Ems flows through it. Barker prizes it because it is one of only 200 chalk streams in the world. Shallow and clear, the streams rise from chalk aquifers and springs, and are beloved by many – 85% of the world’s chalk streams are in England.  But across England, over-abstraction by water companies over decades has been damaging the balance of these unique streams, and the wildlife they harbour. (Abstraction means taking water from any source.) “Our chalk streams desperately need support,” says Barker, “and for people to stop hammering them.” For years, he had watched, incensed, as the water level in the Ems grew steadily lower – water was being siphoned from the aquifer that feeds it by utility company Portsmouth Water. Then, in 2020, it finally happened. In Westbourne, the Ems ran dry. “Portsmouth Water,” says Barker, “have, as part of their abstraction licence, a commitment to pump water back into the river if the flow gets low. But its pumps failed and its alarms didn’t work. The river dried up in the village for the first time in living memory.” Barker felt utter desperation. He had co-founded the Friends of the River Ems earlier that year. “John is a quiet achiever,” says Sandy Barker, a fellow Friend. “He gets a lot done and wears his considerable expertise lightly.” When the river dried up, Barker’s group sprang into action. “There were shallow pools of water with trout swimming around, getting picked off by herons.” They collected the fish in buckets and ferried them to a nearby lake. But not all of them could be saved. Hence the bucket of dead fish. When the executive saw them, “he held his hands up”, Barker remembers. A spokesperson for Portsmouth Water said the company was “absolutely committed” to protecting the Ems and working closely with Friends of the Ems and the Environment Agency. (It accepted that the river ran dry, and that this was not initially noticed because of a communications fault, but said the weather was also partly to blame.) Barker is now working with Portsmouth Water to prevent this catastrophe from happening again. The villagers measure the depth of the River Ems at 15 points. “We call it spring watch,” Barker says. Portsmouth Water has agreed to put sensors in the river to monitor water levels, and the Environment Agency is looking at the details of its abstraction licence. “None of these things would have happened if it wasn’t for the Friends of the Ems,” says Barker. But the problem with Britain’s water goes far deeper. Recent months have seen intense public scrutiny of water companies. Barker is scathing about the £90m fine paid by Southern Water for dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea. “It should also be against human nature to do that.” Barker wants the environment agency to be given more resources, and further investment to put water back into Britain’s waterways. “We need more water,” he says, “whether it’s through reservoirs or recycling.” With more water in the system, companies may not need to rely on abstraction, but this sort of infrastructure costs money. Barker also wants to raise awareness about the situation of many English chalk streams. “We need to keep up the pressure on water companies,” he says. Barker has bought a stay of execution for the River Ems, for now. But without significant investment in infrastructure, he thinks his efforts will probably be just a sticking plaster. “If we’re successful with the Ems,” he says, “and get the water company to stop drawing from us now, they’ll just take water from another place on the aquifer.” Barker requests an underwater camera from Guardian Angel, to monitor the quality of the water and check for dangerous algae. Camera company GoPro provides a camera he can use in the Ems. We catch up after he’s tested it on a chilly winter afternoon. “It’s going to be really useful,” he says. “We can use it to catch some of the wildlife, and to show people how special these chalk streams are. Because that’s one of the most beautiful things about them. The water is so clean and clear.” He plans to send a live stream from the camera to the Friends of the River Ems website. “The more people understand how precious the river is,” Barker says, “the better it will be.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

2/5/2022,"Fashion has a new trend for spring. Well, of course it does – that’s how fashion works. Except this time round, the trend isn’t crimson or corduroy, or Peter Pan collars or platform shoes. The hot look for spring 2022 is the “forever wardrobe”. The key pieces of the season are clothes that come with the promise that they will never go out of style: think crisp white shirts and well-cut blazers; classic knitwear and timeless little black dresses. Throwaway fashion is so last season. This spring, chic comes with a lifetime guarantee. The irony is that the forever wardrobe never went away, it just went out of style. The fast fashion industry, which exploded in the last 30 years, turbocharged the trend cycle, abandoning the principles of enduring elegance in favour of a rollercoaster of plot twists (woah, jumpsuits!), comebacks (Crocs) and about-turns (black is back, again) designed to keep an audience hooked. Bored of your jeans? Why not try leather trousers! Throw out your neutrals, it’s the season for neon!  Many stylish people ignored this all along, of course – even inside the fashion industry, where the front row cheerleads for apple green one season and salmon pink the next, while continuing to mostly wear navy. Now, an urgent need for sustainability has brought investment dressing back into the spotlight. But can fashion ever really come without an expiry date? Or is forever fashion just a feelgood label to make us feel better about buying new clothes? On an emotional level, the change of heart is real, among both the people who buy clothes and the people who design and make them. Fashion is about the future; without a future for the planet, there is no fashion. Everybody gets that now. But on an economic level, things are not so easy. The fashion industry generates 2% of global GDP, and employs more than 400 million people. It has grown to this size specifically through selling us more clothes than we need. And the thrill of transformation has always been part of the power of clothes. From Cinderella to My Fair Lady, Grease to Pretty Woman, the magic of a radical new look is ingrained in our culture. At the height of its imperial pomp, around the beginning of this century, fashion leaned hard into the lure of newness. In the 1970s and 1980s, teenagers tuned into the radio every Sunday to find out what pop song was at number one that week; in the 1990s and 2000s, they gravitated to the Topshop shop floor every weekend to find out what look was new for Saturday night. But that was a more innocent age, before we understood that we were running up a carbon tab we would never be able to pay off. Forever fashion is an easy sell for those lucky enough to be in a position to pivot from buying several new outfits in Zara at the beginning of a season to buying one designer dress. But for shoppers at the “value” end of the market, where jeans can cost as little as £10, there is no Chanel tweed suit (ballpark cost: £8,000) or Hermès Birkin handbag (circa £10,000) at the end of the rainbow. Fashion has become a cheap payday treat, with a new blouse often costing less than a takeaway pizza. High-street price wars have dragged down the quality of the clothes on sale in many shops. Shoppers have become accustomed to cheap, thin fabric which tears easily, to loose and irregular stitching which makes for seams that don’t hold, to buttons which snap or fall off. If your budget is tight and your experience of fashion is shoes with soles that come unstuck and sweaters that lose shape after the first wash, it is entirely rational to resist spending more than the bare minimum on clothes. Right now, investment dressing is an elite sport, like polo or skiing, a luxe pursuit for those with spare cash. At the lower price points, the trust level between shop and shopper has been eroded, and that will take some fixing. Forever fashion is not just about timeless classics over quick turnover trends, but about making clothes that last. The forever wardrobe really does exist, if well designed and properly made. A crisp white cotton shirt, a striped Breton, a simple black one-piece swimsuit, a camel trenchcoat, loafers: these were here all along, and they look as modern now as ever. It may be that we will come to look back on the breakneck-speed version of the industry we have known over the past two or three decades as an aberration, and fashion will return to being about beautiful clothes that are made to be treasured. In a perfect world, the label of a “forever wardrobe” would not be weaponised as a hard sell by retailers to entice consumers with already bulging wardrobes to buy yet more clothes. But the last train to a perfect world left the station some time ago. To use the phrase à la mode, we cannot shop our way to sustainability, but neither can we make an industry that employs one in eight of the world’s workforce disappear overnight. Clothes we want to wear for ever and ever might seem like the opposite of what fashion represents. But from where I’m standing, they look like the last word in chic.

2/5/2022,"In the low winter sunshine of Jo Hynes’s Devon garden, early bumblebees alight on snowdrops, crocuses and cyclamen. The temperature is still low, the days still short, but Hynes has nurtured a great carpet of early flowers, mingled together and stretched out beneath trees and shrubs, many of the shrubs winter-flowering too. She chose this style of planting partly to mimic the way they grow in the wild. “In the Caucasus you see these wonderful meadows of cyclamen and snowdrops, all mixed up together, great sheets of them,” she says.  While the plants may be native to Turkey (which has the widest range of snowdrops), western Russia and the Mediterranean, Hynes’s garden, known as Higher Cherubeer, is very British. “We get a lot of rain here,” she says, “and the soil is acidic clay, so it stays particularly moist. And we are at the top of a hill – 150 metres above sea level in between Dartmoor and Exmoor.” You might think that Mediterranean plants would struggle here, but in fact, there is a great range of snowdrops to suit all sorts of conditions. The snowdrops that are commonly grown in the UK – Galanthus plicatus, G elwesii and G nivalis – all like moisture. In Higher Cherubeer, though, they are helped by being grown under trees and shrubs. “Cyclamen and snowdrops flower in the late winter and early spring, and in doing so they make the most of the time when there is no canopy to the trees,” Hynes says. “Then, when the trees are in growth, the conditions encourage them to go into dormancy, just as the heat does in the Mediterranean summer.” Hynes and her husband, Tom, arrived at Higher Cherubeer 31 years ago. It was a working dairy farm at the time, and what is now the garden was a rough, windy field with vegetable strips and a bit of orchard. The first thing they did was to put in a shelter belt of native trees to slow down the winds; over time gravel paths were put in place, and trees and borders were planted. Tom is a stonewaller and has created steps and walls from which ferns and cyclamen spring. They give the garden a strong structure that is particularly visible, and useful, in winter. The impetus to make it a winter garden came after Hynes took up basket weaving 10 years ago. “I wanted a source of colourful stems, so planted up willows that could be cut back each year to provide long, whippy, colourful weaving material. Then I wanted to plant flowers that would look good alongside them, so started planting snowdrops, cyclamen, hellebores, witch hazels.” She wanted to open the garden to visitors, but, she says: “Devon is a county with lots of gardens and not that many people.” So she decided to start a National Collection – which involves collecting and growing a significant number of one type of plant, and is overseen by the UK charity Plant Heritage – to draw visitors into the garden. She chose cyclamen as there is a manageable number to collect, and because they flower in winter: “There are only two or three gardens open in Devon in February,” she says. Hynes now grows 22 of the 23 known cyclamen species and many of their forms and cultivars in the garden, and more than 400 snowdrop varieties. She has developed some favourites over the years, such as snowdrop “S Arnott”, a late-flowered cultivar with a beautiful scent, which she uses as the main drifts within the borders, and “Daisy Hynes”, a neat snowdrop with green markings, named after their daughter. She recommends Cyclamen coum, C alpinum and C pseudibericum, all of which naturalise well under trees and shrubs, and flower with the snowdrops from January to March. Hynes grows all of the cyclamen and many of the snowdrops in pots in her greenhouses, where their subtle differences can be appreciated up close by aficionados. Beyond the beauty of filling the garden with flowers in late winter, and the joy Hynes evidently gets from her visitors, there is a great benefit to wildlife in planting such early flowers. “I was a beekeeper when I first arrived,” she says, “and I wanted to plant nectar-rich flowers for my bees. Honeybees are awake all through winter and on warm days they will venture out, so by planting in this way I was able to provide them with pollen. Late-winter and early-spring flowers help hives to make it through winter.” For native bumblebees this is possibly even more important. They will also fly on mild winter days, and unlike honeybees they have no store of honey to fall back on. “Insects of all kinds are increasingly likely to venture out in winter as our weather becomes less predictable,” says Hynes. “We can all help them out by planting crocuses, cyclamen, Anemone blanda and pollen-rich plants such as native Helleborus foetidus. They make the garden beautiful even in one of the coldest months of winter, and the bees love them.” Higher Cherubeer is open for the National Garden Scheme on 11 and 19 February.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Winter gardens: cyclamen and snowdrops bring Mediterranean joy to deepest Devon,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/05/winter-gardens-cyclamen-and-snowdrops-bring-mediterranean-joy-to-deepest-devon
2/5/2022,"The sky. You might think it is useless and just there, however it is one of the most fascinating sights ever! When I wake up, I eagerly scramble out of my comfy bed, leap towards my window and yank open my curtains just to get a view of the scenic sky.  The morning sun comes up and the ripple-like clouds (called cirrocumulus) make the sky look like an upside down, pink river. When I walk to school, the neon-yellow sun grows brighter in the baby-blue sky. At this time, the sky produces high, wispy clouds (called cirrus) and big fluffy ones (called cumulus) that embrace the winter sky around them. At our lunch break, our faces light up when the snow starts to fall. We leap in the air trying to catch some. I love it when light grey clouds envelope the sky and give it a tranquil effect. At home when it gets to dinner time, I gaze at the sky outside and observe that it has become a soothing coal-black, and it does not change until I fall asleep. The beauty of the sky is: wherever you go, you see it differently, but it always looks nice. The sky is something that keeps us alive and allows us to experience amazing sights however rich or poor we are, so we ought to be grateful for it.Rohan, 9  Read today’s other Young Country Diary: ‘Ten thousand starlings roar over my head.

2/5/2022,"Full of anticipation, I scan the horizon, watching for black spots that will signal the start of the murmuration – my first ever. I wait, full of suspense. The ruby-red sun is setting across the lush, green hills. Suddenly, there’s a flood of black in my peripheral vision; they are here, roaring over my head – possibly at over 50mph. A writhing flood of birds sends tidal waves over the tranquil reeds. I look on in awe. The wind whistles through their wings; the dance of the sky unfolds. The rush, the flutter of feathers, the cries of weary starlings coming down to rest in their tightly packed roosts (as many as 500 birds per cubic metre); the sound is a song of travel and community.  With the last of them quieting their calls, it is over in under 15 minutes. Ten thousand glorious, glossy-black starlings have come down to rest in the golden reeds. I am full of wonder; these beautiful birds moved in perfect synchronicity. Experts believe that they use scale-free correlation – one bird following the other, like a bicyclist putting their arm out to signal their direction. Shortly after the starlings have arrived, they seem to disappear … the only evidence of their arrival a chatting cacophony of community. Exhilarated, I go home to roost.Ash, 11  Read today’s other Young Country Diary: ‘Anyone can look up and enjoy the scenic sky’",News/Environment,Young country diary: Ten thousand starlings roar over my head.

2/5/2022,"When I was in tenth grade in Tampa, Florida, I was, like millions of other high school students, assigned to read The Catcher in the Rye for English class. Like millions of other high school students, I was extremely fragile. I was holding on by a thread. I was 15 and spent much of my time at school, on the days I would go, doing OxyContin, Xanax, cocaine and speed in the bathroom. I jittered and itched through class, and my internal life was, to say the least, stifled. It would continue to be stifled for the next few years, until it became so claustrophobic that I attempted suicide. Needless to say, I was pretty hit or miss with school assignments. But I had always liked to read. I decided to crack Salinger’s book and read a chapter or two. I stayed up all night and finished it. I came into class the next day wired, eyes wide: it felt as if I had been hooked up to a car battery. I remember walking into the classroom and saying to my English teacher, “What the hell was that?” I didn’t know anything about the book. I didn’t know that the men who shot John Lennon and Ronald Reagan were both obsessed with it. I didn’t know that it was the subject of endless think pieces debating the ethical ramifications of Holden Caulfield’s character. I didn’t know Salinger stormed the beaches on D-Day, carried scars from his years in war. I just got sucked in. It is a funny, polarising little book. I remember my girlfriend at the time saying she hated it, that she couldn’t get through it. But my teacher told me that every year at least one person does what I did, gets hooked up to the car battery. Looking back, it makes sense that someone in my particular situation would have this reaction to it. In fact, it is almost embarrassing just how cliched it is. But that’s what happened. And, in what would become a theme of my life, what stuck with me more than any of the particular content of the book was the feeling of being sucked in, of losing time trapped in someone else’s words and turbulent emotions.  My English teacher was a “tough” Italian guy from the Bronx, and he knew what was going on with me. He once told me that if he saw me outside school, “on the corner”, he would kick my ass. I remember laughing at the idea I spent my time “on the corner” like I was selling drugs in a movie, but the sentiment was sweet. He was extremely adoring of the books we read, and he was pretty compelling. If I had been maybe a shade less lost, it might have been enough for me to devote my life to the study of English right then and there. But that isn’t how it went down. He did, however, hold me back after class and start feeding me extracurricular books. First was Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead, which I am ashamed to say affected me. Once again, I was unaware of any of the larger political discussions surrounding the book, which was written as a testament to individualism and self-will. I don’t think I even knew the word “libertarian”, but I found the book’s ego-bolstering philosophy useful as my life started to fall apart, as I grew more distant from my loved ones and found myself inside the rigid structures of psychiatric hospitals, rehabs and jail. Then, even more affecting, was Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison. Here was a character getting pushed and pulled through the world, shaping his identity in spite of and in relation to everything and everybody else. He ran from the world but was always drawn back. As I was reading, I could tell that the book was vital and important. I felt that it was changing me in real time. In 2008, the number of “pill mills” in Florida almost tripled. These pain management clinics prescribed exorbitant amounts of opiates and accepted only cash payments with little to no regard for symptoms. In the last six months of the year, 45 doctors in south Florida prescribed more than 9m pills of oxycodone, which crept across the entire country. People started dropping like flies, overdosing or getting sucked into their own personal orbits of addiction and isolation. As this machine started to whir to life, I was 16 going on 17. The sudden influx of these pills made them cheaper and more ubiquitous. But even before this, while my peers were experimenting with weed and drinking at parties, I had been doing coke and “oxys”. I had tried these things after doing the more normal drugs in middle school. Like everyone else, I really enjoyed feeling good, but I didn’t appear to have any brakes. In this time of unprecedented addiction, my story is wholly unremarkable. Drugs, rehab, jail, self-help groups. I would guess that just about everyone in the US went to high school with at least a few people whose lives were on the same trajectory. In the midst of the inherently isolating circumstances of acute addiction, I felt no camaraderie or togetherness with them. In my self-absorbed world, books were my company. They gave me something that everyone needs: the thoughts and feelings of others. They didn’t just help me to understand myself, they provided me with messages from someone who had nothing to do with me. The temporary escape from self was intoxicating. As everyone was keen to remind me during this period, addiction is progressive; it gets worse over time. Once the needles came into play, I was pretty much helpless. By the time I dropped out of high school, I was shooting coke and meth, and things were starting to look very dire. There is a very real precipice there, a line that, once crossed, makes it hard to ever live a normal life again. It seemed like I was crossing it. My internal life was dominated by an all-consuming desire for drugs and fantasies of suicide, each one feeding into the other. Reading was the one activity that seemed to temporarily extract me from this cycle. It felt like a way for me to preserve something of myself – like trying to build a fire, guarding it from the wind and stoking it, trying to coax it into something bigger. Books engaged my brain, but also bypassed it, distracted it, so they could touch my heart and stir up sentiments that I might not have been able to access otherwise. I didn’t have a TV – half the time I didn’t even have a room. My living situations were temporary: motels, rehabs, couches, jail, the sidewalk or public parks. I passed through these places like a ghost. But the library was always there, always available. It also proved extremely useful because a book typically takes longer to get through than a movie. Time was crucial to me, or rather, escaping it was. And so, I continued to return to the library. Reading for hours, lost in the shelves. While opiates were the drug of choice for my demographic, the uppers I was hooked on gave me more energy than a person needs to live a life. I have always attributed the paranoia and psychosis that often follows these drugs as a side-effect of a pattern-seeking brain provided with too much energy. Starved of information, it starts to build systems of interpretation out of nothingness. Books helped me here as well: omniscience became something I craved, more information to stave off paranoia, and rich fantasy worlds to supplement the bare life in front of me. Yet there was an aspect of masochism in it. I punished myself with difficult books I couldn’t quite understand. I read The Idiot by Dostoevsky in two days at a public library, shooting coke in between chapters. I remember very little about the book, but I forced my eyes to touch every word. It became like that old punishment when you catch your kid smoking cigarettes and you make them smoke the whole pack. “Oh, you like reading, huh? How about you read it all in one sitting then?” In the institutions I was frequenting, my reading was viewed as a sort of idiosyncrasy, just a personality tic of a weird and troubled young man. After I was arrested for robbery in 2011 and no one bailed me out, I read compulsively. At first, I was in a cell where the lighting was dim, so reading was difficult but not impossible. My bunkmate hoarded books even though he had trouble reading them. He would lend them to me and ask me to tell him what they were about. They were mostly romance novels: engaged woman moves back to her home town and falls in love with a humble country boy; young widow is swept off her feet by an honest contractor, etc. I found it easy to immerse myself in them. They moved me to another facility that was open dorm, and, thankfully, they kept some lights on all night. I slept a lot during the day and read in silence most of the night. I read the Bible, I found an old copy of The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene, I read a Twilight book and one of the Game of Thrones books, I read Eckhart Tolle’s self-help book The Power of Now. It was an absurd syllabus, but I didn’t care. As Valentine’s Day approached, someone in my unit asked me to help him write a love letter to his girlfriend. He told me what he wanted to say, and I wrote it down for him, embellishing and adding things as I saw fit. The content got a little more explicit, and after he sent the letter, he wanted me to write him something else, something more explicitly explicit. He described the type of woman he wanted me to write about, or rather, her body. And I indulged him with three pages of pure sexual fantasy. We negotiated a price for this service: two “soups” (ramen packets) and a bag of Doritos. My first advance. He was grateful, and word got out. I wrote a few more of these stories for other guys in the unit, each one of them approaching me and giving me prompts about how they wanted their story told, what they wanted it to include. I only wrote four of them before I was transferred to another facility, but I could feel myself getting better each time, more attentive to detail but never allowing myself to get too far from the main point. The next institution was a facility focused on addiction and co-occurring mental disorders, and we weren’t allowed to have books. I was halfway through Moby-Dick when they confiscated it. I was livid – it felt like someone took away my pacifier – so I passed some of the time when I wasn’t reading doing the next best thing I could think of: writing. I wrote a few poems and a short story that strangely mirrored the novel I would write years later. It was very amateurish, but the preoccupations were the same: muddled perspective, first and third person fighting with each other, body and mind disconnected, and the chaos of amphetamine psychosis. When I left the facility after two months, I think I made it a few weeks before I was back shooting coke. I wouldn’t write again for three years, and I stopped reading. The world was harsh, and I couldn’t find a place in it for myself. I hated using drugs and I couldn’t stop. I was 19 and I was alone. I had five years of intense drug use behind me, the last two of which were so extreme and tumultuous that I couldn’t make sense of them. They itched and burned in my head like a wound that wouldn’t heal. It just felt like the machine of my self was totalled. Whatever little fire I was trying to build in that deep corner of my soul seemed to be extinguished. I was so exhausted by the cycle of my life, my imagination so eroded, that I couldn’t think of any way to get out of it except for one. I tried to kill myself, and when it didn’t work, the fatigue enveloped me again. I spent the next year like a zombie, bloated and groggy from the anti-psychotics. I slept close to 14 hours a day. My probation officer was on at me to take my high school equivalency degree test, and after I did, I started to wean myself off the anti-psychotics. I finished Moby-Dick and started to go to college. My teenage years had been full of teachers and counsellors warning me about the dangers of “squandered potential” of not “applying myself”. These types of comments have a way of boosting one’s ego, being heard as: “I am so special and smart that everything bores me,” and I think I did originally take them in this way. But as everything progressed, the comments stuck with me on a deeper, more spiritual level. Not “potential” as something special to me, but just regular old human potential. And the prospect of a life without “application” seemed like the most existentially terrifying sentence I could imagine. I started college with the aim of getting a degree that would help me get a cushy, well-paid job, but within a few semesters found myself completely sidetracked by the humanities and creative writing. Finally, in writing, I applied myself easily. I didn’t have to force it; every aspect of myself switched on comfortably. I exhausted every little bit of my intellect and emotional and spiritual being every morning as I wrote. I spent my afternoons reading, filling my brain with other people’s words, finding that battery that lives in language, the one I felt years ago. I started to see writing as something I could hand myself over to fully. As with reading and drugs, there were mornings where I would enter a sort of trance. I would lose my sense of time and space, and I think if someone were to burst through my door in those moments and ask me what my name was, it would probably have taken me a few seconds to come up with the answer. It was a beautiful feeling. Paradoxically, it was through these solitary activities that I found myself able to finally start engaging with the world and others. In sobriety, I met people who shared my desperate experiences with drugs. In college, I met people who shared my love of reading. The companionship I found in reading started to give way to real relationships with other people. In the past few months, I have turned 30 and celebrated 10 years of sobriety. My life is richer and deeper than those few miserable years when I was younger. In my day-to-day existence, I don’t think much about them, and even when I was writing a book that was born from these experiences, I didn’t think much about them after I was done writing for the day. My life is full of relationships, ideas and feelings wholly unrelated to addiction, a luxury I couldn’t afford back then. But I can’t deny the formative power of those experiences. What I take from them is this: having a brain can make you pretty self-centred. But the meaningful presence of others, at its best, can keep that in check. In the absence of others, in my isolated, solipsistic little world, I found a way to challenge my brain through reading, and, in doing so, preserved a faraway corner of my heart.

2/5/2022,"I’m a huge sports fan, so revel in everything around a big sporting event: getting friends over, the TV set up and, of course, prepping the ultimate game-day spread. The Super Bowl next weekend is the perfect excuse to get some American-style dishes on the go, and it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t make a couple of Joe Allen classics. Today’s recipes have been a closely guarded secret – or at least until now – and, regardless of whether or not you’re a meat eater, together they make the perfect finger food for everyone who can’t take their eyes off the screen.  You can roast the racks a few hours in advance, then leave them to cool and refrigerate, ready for their final grilling. And if you’re willing to brave the chill outdoors, you could also finish them off on the barbecue.

Put all the ingredients for the sauce in a medium saucepan, bring slowly up to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and leave to cook gently, whisking regularly to keep the heat evenly distributed and to stop the mix catching and burning, for 30-40 minutes. You will end up with a fairly thick glaze; if need be, thin it out with a little water. Peel off and discard the silverskin off the back of the ribs, rub them all over with all of the spice rub and place on a rack in a deep-sided oven tray. Heat the oven to 110C (90C fan)/225F/gas ¼. Turn on the oven fan to high and/or ventilate your kitchen. Put a scoop of wood chips in a heatproof oven dish, put them in the oven and set them alight. Once the flames have died down and the wood chips are smoking, put the ribs in the oven, shut the door and leave to cook for 30 minutes. Put another handful of wood chips in the heatproof dish, set them alight and wait until the flames subside and the chips are smoking. Turn up the heat to 160C (140C fan)/310F/gas 2½ and wet a large sheet of greaseproof paper. Brush each rib in the sauce mix, cover the tray with the wet paper, bake for another two hours and remove To serve, slather the ribs in more sauce, transfer to a hot grill and cook, turning regularly, for five to eight minutes, until nicely caramelised all over. Either serve the racks whole or cut them up into individual ribs, put in a bowl and serve as the perfect finger food, ideally with some coleslaw on the side.

2/5/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Norway started as they mean to continue with two golds in quick succession, but the windy conditions have been an issue for several events Next up: There is still some curling, speedskating, freestyle skiing and ice hockey left today, and tomorrow – conditions permitting – we should get the glorious sight of the men’s downhill Alpine skiing  The first gold medal of the Games went to Norway’s Therese Johaug in the women’s 7.5km + 7.5km Skiathlon. She has won 10 world championship titles and it was the fourth Olympic medal of her career, but her first individual Olympic gold. She absolutely bossed it, finishing 30 seconds ahead of Russian Olympic Committee athlete Natalya Nepryayeva in second and Austria’s Teresa Stadlober in third after a gruelling race. The wind played havoc with the shooting in an exciting Biathlon mixed relay race, gusting up to 5.6 metres per second at some points. A gripping three-man finish gave Norway their second gold, while the Russian team gained a second silver. France recovered from a dreadful first leg to claim the bronze. The wind was also buffeting the snowboarders. Great Britain’s Katie Ormerod – who missed out in Pyeongchang in 2018 due to a horrendous injury – failed to qualify for the finals of the women’s slopestyle. New Zealand’s Zoi Sadowski-Synnott leads the pack going into tomorrow’s final. Jamie Anderson and Julia Marino of the US, and Australia’s Tess Coady are all safely through. “It’s cold! It’s hard to keep your core temperature warm and then doing tricks feels a little bit more intimidating as you are just, like, stiff,” said two-time Olympic gold medalist Anderson. The Dutch have been a dominant force at Olympic speed skating for years, and there was no let-up as Irene Schouten claimed the Netherlands’ first gold in the 3,000m speed skating. She broke Germany’s Claudia Pechstein’s Olympic record that had stood since 2002. Incredibly, aged 49, Pechstein herself also broke a record today – becoming the oldest woman to compete at a Winter Olympics. In the mixed doubles curling Team GB’s Jen Dodds and Bruce Mouat continued to make progress with a convincing win over the Czech Republic. They’ve only lost one of their five matches so far. Later today they face Italy’s Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner. They are as yet unbeaten in their five. Something will have to give. Things you might have missed Shaun White, triple gold medallist and the oldest member of the US team in China has announced that the Beijing Games will be his final snowboarding event. He told a press conference that when he made the decision he was on a chairlift by himself. “I was watching the sun go down and it just hit me,” he said. “It was very sad and a surreal moment but really joyous as well.” A total of 45 new positive Covid tests have been announced, with athletes and officials accounting for 25 of the cases. “In general we think the situation is under control. The cases within the closed loop have not spread and they do not affect the competition” said Huang Chun, the Games’ deputy director-general of the office of pandemic prevention and control. Dutch journalist Sjoerd den Daas was dragged away by Chinese security officials in the middle of making a live broadcast for NOS last night. The IOC has rather blandly described it as “an unfortunate circumstance”. He was eventually able to continue broadcasting from the opening ceremony.
