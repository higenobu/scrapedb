4/18/2022,"In the middle of it all, someone fetched David Alaba a chair. It was late, it had been a long week, his legs were weary and everyone were making a lot of noise, but this seat was not for sitting. This was for celebrating, his thing now, and so he took it and lifted it above his head. Back by popular demand, he emulated what he had done after that absurd comeback against Paris Saint Germain, a cheer went round the dressing room and his team-mates started singing: “That’s the way Madrid win!” They had only gone and done it again, and this time it had taken the title. “It’s just three points, that’s the reality,” Nacho Fernández said standing pitchside when it was all finished bar the shouting, and there was a lot of that, but the reality was that the league was theirs, clinched their way. Four days after their implausible revival against Chelsea, Real Madrid came back from 2-0 to beat Sevilla 3-2 in a brilliant match at the Sánchez Pizjuán, the only remaining unbeaten home record over and the race as good as over with it. A title winner in Italy, England, Germany and France, Carlo Ancelotti should now add Spain, a fifth different championship arriving via a second opportunity he never expected, a chance phone call about something completely different bringing him back to the Bernabéu. It might even arrive soon: Madrid don’t play next weekend – Saturday is the Copa del Rey final between Valencia and Betis – but by Sunday night they could be champions, if Barcelona slip up this week. Fifteen points clear with six games left, what little hope anyone else had slipped away late on Sunday night. Very lateSunday night. It was Easter Sunday in the place where they take the passion of Christ more seriously than anywhere else, the orange blossom again turning Seville into the best-smelling city on earth, and a huge banner had covered one end at the Pizjuán. “They celebrated our death; they will fear our resurrection,” it read. They meant Sevilla of course – and there are two Jesuses in their team, etc and so on – but it was made for Madrid, always somehow standing there when the rock is rolled back. BENZEMA!!! 😱😱From 2-0 down to 3-2 up for Real Madrid! ⚪""And that could be the goal that decides LaLiga!"" 🗣️ pic.twitter.com/uTIIqR42YH Ivan Rakitic had scored the opening goal, his free kick going through the wall where Éder Militão had been. Five minutes later, Érik Lamela made it 2-0, the place going wild. They weren’t even half an hour in and they were flying. Beaten just once since the last time they faced Madrid, way back in November and not at all at home, Sevilla were in control, playing the ball from deep, starting each move pretty much on their own by-line. At one point they worked their way out from the corner, got forced back into it, and so just worked their way out again, accompanied by olés from the stand. “We had the game in a good place,” Rakitic said. This was going to be some story; instead, it was the story of their season. Close, but not. There, but out of reach, a feeling that they just couldn’t take that step, at some level they still didn’t really believe it however well it was going. “There was a fear of winning,” Julen Lopetegui admitted. There was also that other recurring theme, players breaking down all over the field. Antony Martial was taken out by Eduardo Camavinga, and forced off where the Madrid midfielder might have been sent off, a moment they felt changed everything. Marcos Acuña went too. Then Lamela. “Had we kept them all on, I’m sure we would have won,” said Monchi, the sporting director. “It’s such a pity.” He too saw their whole season in this one game, opportunity lost. A “photo” he called it. In the end, it wasn’t even that good. A proper portrait would have had them drawing. Sevilla didn’t lose in eleven league games after the turn of the year, the transfer window – signing Tecatito Corona and Martial, resisting Newcastle’s approach for Diego Carlos – reflecting a feeling that they were standing before a unique opportunity. The problem was they didn’t win much either; seven of those ended in a draw, the challenge disintegrating one point at a time Even second place slipped. Now fourth could as well. They were knocked out of the cup by Betis and the Europa League by West Ham, missing out on the chance of winning their trophy in their stadium. And now that stadium saw its first defeat of the league season, ending in whistles and recrimination. Lamela was asked how the two halves could be so different. “We’re asking ourselves exactly that,” he said, but in truth the shift had come earlier, late in the first half. “You can’t give them even a centimetre,” the Sevilla captain Rakitic said . “We invited them to come back.” Even at 2-0 – a scoreline Sevilla had not let slip in almost a decade at home – there was feeling that this was coming. Not just because this is Sevilla but because that is Madrid “Everyone was waiting for us to slip but this team doesn’t slip, because it has courage, heart and character,” Ancelotti said. Some seriously good players too, and a manager who listens to them, reaches them, and trusts in them. “This team is capable of doing special things,” Ancelotti added and for all the talk of epic, mentality, or fortune, there is also a physical capacity, all the more unexpected for how rarely they rotate. Above all there is football. Madrid left it late, but were superb in the second half in Seville, the three goals far from their only chances and as much about talent as well as temperament. Each time cutting right through to the by-line, Vinicius in particular provided lovely touches to open up his opponents. The changes worked too, as they often do with Ancelotti, and the contrast to Sevilla was stark. Rodrygo, on at half time, quickly got the first and Nacho scored the second on 82. Granada1-4 Levante, Atlético Madrid 2-1 Espanyol, Athletic Bilbao 0-2 Celta Vigo, Sevilla 2-3 Real Madrid. Elche 3-0 Real Mallorca, Alavés 1-0 Rayo Vallecano, Valencia 1-2 Osasuna, Getafe 1-2 Villarreal, Real Sociedad 0-0 Real Betis That might have already been Madrid’s third, Thibaut Courtois sitting on the advertising boards at one end amiably chatting to Sevilla’s fans about a whether an earlier “goal” would be given, only for the VAR to decide that Vinicius had handled. Instead, with Julen Lopetegui frantically waving on the touchline, the third had to wait until Benzema finished off another neat move in the ninety-second minute. He then dashed towards the men on the bench as they ran towards him. Ancelotti clenched his fists and shouted. Alaba held his head in his hands. And players and staff piled in. To their right, Lopetegui looked broken. They knew what it meant. “We’re a little closer,” Nacho said but it was a lot. This game, the covers of both Madrid papers had agreed on Sunday morning, was “half a league”, championship point or break point, as Diario AS put it. Barcelona and Sevilla had been handed hope and then had it taken away again. Rafa Mir had missed a glorious chance to end it at 2-1 only to head over but with eight minutes left Madrid were still losing. Had it stayed that way, they would have gone to Pamplona – not somewhere they enjoy – knowing that another defeat could have seen them reach the end of next weekend just three points ahead. statement pic.twitter.com/sYWHBpYyGS Instead, they could soon be champions. Madrid need just ten points in six games to be sure, whatever the rest do now, responding when it mattered once more. “Statement,” Toni Kroos called it, the entire team posing for a picture together – well, almost the entire team. Maybe Gareth Bale was taking it. One last major hurdle was overcome the way that they like it, the title as good as theirs even if they still have to wait for the trophy, Alaba’s chair playing the part for just a little longer.",Sport/Sport, After yet another comeback the Liga title will soon be Real Madrid’s again | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/after-yet-another-comeback-the-liga-title-will-soon-be-real-madrids-again
4/18/2022,"“Christ is risen, Alleluia. He is risen indeed, Alleluia, Alleluia.” Thus spake Jacob Rees-Mogg on Easter Sunday, on Twitter. (How does the guy manage to sound posh quoting something that surely sprang forth before poshness was invented?) Rees-Mogg was then immediately taken to task by the wonderful cook and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe on the same platform – let’s call it Godly Twitter – who wrote: “Jesus would have flipped the table and driven you out of the temple, FYI.” She went on to quote from the book of Titus: “They claim to know God, but by their actions, they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.” (Monroe, you will note, manages to make the Bible sound as if it was written yesterday.) I’ve picked up a thing or two about Jesus over the years, and it sounds pretty open-and-shut, whose side he would be on, between Rees-Mogg, a multimillionaire and bringer of financial devastation to innocent families, and … well, anyone else. But what do I know? I’m no Christian. Meanwhile, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, took not to the socials but to a pulpit, to castigate the Home Office plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. It “cannot stand up to the judgment of God”, he said. In case this left anyone in any doubt, he added that the policy was “the opposite of the nature of God”. Various Conservative MPs objected to his “moralising”, which five years ago would have been funny – what next, are they going to object to their surgeon being a know-it-all for pointing out where their spleen is? But these days, slating an archbishop for having Christian values is probably the least embarrassing thing they will be asked to do this week. A special mention here for the rightwing pundit Tim Montgomerie, whose response to Welby was: “Jesus is risen. And the sun is out. And I’ve been given a huge chocolate egg.” Credit to the man, isn’t that the real meaning of Easter? That it’s a time to put aside the suffering of others, and concentrate on the happiness of the man who looks after No 1? It’s a tricky one for the Conservatives, the Church of England. Can’t live with it, can’t privatise it.

4/18/2022,"For centuries Izyum was regarded as the gateway to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and, from there, to the Black Sea. The Russians called the area around it Izyum passage. Its strategic position has meant Izyum has become a fierce battleground in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as Moscow uses it as a launching point for its assault against Ukrainian forces in Donbas. It fell fully to Russian forces on 1 April, trapping thousands of civilians in a city where as many as 80% of its residential buildings have been destroyed. “Before the war, Izyum had a population of 46,000 people,” said the city’s mayor, Valerii Marchenko, who managed to leave with thousands of fellow citizens before its capture. “There was a plant that produced military equipment, some small and middle businesses. Relationships with the neighbouring cities in Donbas were friendly. We always helped each other. But that was before.” It is difficult for Ukrainian authorities to know the situation in Izyum, which is located 70 miles south-east of Kharkiv. Before the Russian occupation, local authorities managed to evacuate part of the population. But according to officials, approximately 10,000 to 15,000 citizens remain trapped, their fate uncertain. “We cannot know for sure, because about 1,000 civilians were killed in airstrikes, artillery shelling and bombings,” said Marchenko. “The last centralised evacuation was on 10 March. We organised a green corridor with 60 buses. Humanitarian aid flowed in and people fled on those buses. “Then we tried three times to organise green corridors, but when the buses got closer to town they were shot by the Russians and had to turn around. Some volunteers used their own cars and risked their lives to evacuate people, but the organised evacuation was impossible. And now that the city is occupied, our hands are tied.” Witnesses told the Guardian how inhabitants had survived in their basements for weeks, without electricity, heating or running water. The capture of Izyum took a number of weeks. “Our town is separated into a northern and southern part by the Siverskyi Donets River,” said Marchenko. “The Russians first tried to enter the northern part. Our military blew up the bridges so they couldn’t enter the southern part from where they could move on to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. “For almost three weeks they couldn’t take over the southern part. There were numerous attempts from the Russian invaders to build temporary bridges over the river, but our defenders destroyed them. After countless attempts, they managed to cross the river, besiege the city and, after a week, gain control of the southern part.” A 60-year-old man from Izyum said he managed to escape Russian troops before the city fell by swimming across the Severskyi Donets during freezing weather. “I was in the northern part of the city when armed men who introduced themselves as soldiers of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic came to me,” said the man. “They threatened me with weapons and took away two of my vehicles: a minibus and an SUV, as well as all the alcohol that was at home. At the time when they were robbing the house, they let me out of sight [and] I took advantage of the moment and escaped.” He continued: “I swam to the southern part of Izyum across the river. I then contacted the city authorities by phone and they organised an ‘evacuation walk’, so they told us the path we had to walk. Eight people agreed to this risky operation, including four women, one teenager and a girl with cancer who urgently needed chemotherapy. We walked about 15km [9 miles] under fire [and] at the appointed place we were met by the Izyum mayor, Valerii Marchenko, and other employees. Then we all drove to Sloviansk and have been safe ever since.” Izyum has now become a hub for Russian forces. According to officials, its capture has allowed Russia to move artillery 30 miles towards areas of Donbas under Ukrainian control. “Our troops are holding them there,” said Marchenko. “But there is a lot of machinery in the town. They are moving their troops from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions into Izyum. Before, all their machinery was marked with the letter Z, but now it’s also V and O. They are concentrating their troops, machinery and equipment to advance their attack on Donbas.” As Russian forces advance, the mayors of Balakliya and Kupyansk, cities 30 miles and 43 miles from Izyum respectively, made a deal with Russian authorities. Both are now facing life imprisonment for treason. “I just don’t understand them,” said Marchenko. “I was also receiving offers from the invaders with a demand to let them through and surrender. I told them I’m a mayor of a Ukrainian town. And it will remain this way. And I will never become a traitor. Why did they do this? You should ask them.” Some witnesses have alleged that the Russians have prepared a list of individuals to “hunt”: those who may own weapons, businesspeople, activists and military. The fear is that Izyum will become another Bucha, where hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves or left in the streets. “Bucha and Izyum are very similar,” said Marchenko. “In both, more than 80% of residential buildings are destroyed. People in both cities were hiding in basements for more than a month under constant shelling. There was no food. Some reports claim the Russians are compiling a list of people who need humanitarian aid. But instead they are preparing a list of activists, Donbas war veterans, police officers and local business owners. If they find them, they’ll be driven to an unknown location, and we will know nothing about their fate.” Based on the Russian advance in recent weeks, the conquest of Donbas seems imminent, but Marchenko believes nothing is lost while Ukrainian soldiers are standing in front of them.",News/World news,‘Very similar’: fears gateway city to Donbas will become another Bucha,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/bucha-izyum-fears-gateway-city-donbas-russia-ukraine
4/18/2022,"In British politics, nothing is as it seems – apparently. Barely had news of the Home Office’s draconian immigration deal with Rwanda broken on Thursday when it began to be proclaimed a political diversion. Journalists and MPs alike invoked the tired image of a “dead cat”, the phrase associated with the strategist Lynton Crosby to describe the act of wilfully talking up one hot-button issue to divert attention from another. Members of the public took to social media to agree that, yes, the plan to process certain asylum seekers in offshore centres, thousands of miles away, was indeed just an attempt to push Partygate off the front pages. Except, this explanation doesn’t really tally. Attempts to “outsource” asylum applications have been in the works for nearly three years. Negotiations with Rwanda reportedly took place over eight months. The plan forms a key part of the breathtakingly inhumane plank of immigration policies the home secretary Priti Patel is introducing – a cruel (and illegal) attempt to make an already hostile environment completely unliveable. So why the conviction that this latest proposal – hardly shifting criticism away from Boris Johnson, who took ownership of the policy – is not a means to an end, but a smokescreen to shield him? The spectre of the dead cat has been everywhere during Johnson’s tenure as prime minister. Writing in 2019, the historian Charlotte Lydia Riley implored commentators to cease proclaiming every political happenstance to be a dead cat. “The idea that there must be a clever plan behind political campaigns also shows our desire to believe that there is someone, somewhere, in control,” she wrote. “But in truth, politics is messy. Nobody is in control. The world is not governed by clever people doing clever things.” But this paranoid style has only grown – cultivated during the Brexit and Trump years, it is now a mainstay of political conversation. Where is it coming from? A lack of trust is one obvious answer. Westminster is viewed with suspicion across the union. In England, two in five people believe that “democracy is not working”, citing a “loss of trust” and “corruption” as the biggest factors. While the Welsh electorate still have faith in their devolved parliament, only 28% trust the national government to look after their interests. Polling in Scotland and Northern Ireland records similarly dismal levels of confidence in the UK executive. The public is also increasingly sceptical of the journalists charged with reflecting the world back at them. Despite a pandemic-induced boost, overall trust in wider UK news reporting only comes in at 36% – 14 percentage points lower than before 2016’s Brexit referendum. While this is not quite a full-blown crisis in faith, it speaks to that broader miasma of distrust that has rolled over the land in the past five years. Many people don’t know quite what or who to believe any more, as the political identities and givens that previously anchored them have turned to sand beneath their feet. And so they turn to conspiratorial thinking. By this I don’t mean people across Britain are signing up to full-blown conspiracy theories about vaccines and moon landings, but rather that we increasingly defer to a knowing cynicism about the world – which always assumes the “real” meaning of political events is hidden. Rwanda deportation plans are a dead cat. A moral panic about transgender people is solely a Tory endeavour to distract from the cost of living crisis. Tighter Covid-19 rules are a diversion – no, wait, relaxed Covid-19 rules are the real trick mirror. All of these things, slightly feverishly suspicious as they are, sound as if they could be true. But often a little digging suggests they are not. The problem is that there are, of course, dead cats flung on to the table every so often – take Johnson desperately trying to deflect from Partygate scrutiny by repeating a discredited claim linking Keir Starmer to Jimmy Savile. A healthy dose of cynicism and critical thinking never goes amiss when analysing the political landscape. But this rising tendency of fearful mistrust paired with alternative (often ill-informed) explanations concerns me. But if you are “politically homeless” (a term I despise but is increasingly used), then anything goes. Party membership can be grounding – fostering connections in communities and orienting people towards shared political goals (research suggests that partisanship limits exactly which conspiratorial narratives are to be believed). What then happens when traditional alignments are replaced with political identities that are issue based? Add in a shocking lack of political education, a climate of fear stoked by media and politicians alike and the disappearance of independent local media, and you can see how many of the public have now been left to cobble together their own hodgepodge understanding of the inner workings of the institutions that govern their lives. The results are a suitably mishmashed and jaded interpretation of events. Why does this matter? Because the stronger the tendency towards conspiratorial accounts of everything, the more likely a worsening of the social ills that cause disaffection in the first place. Political distrust and conspiratorial thinking lead to nihilism and apathy. Successive studies have found that full-blown conspiratorial beliefs positively correlate with political disengagement, more belligerent attitudes to human rights and civil liberties, and less civic participation, such as voting, donating and volunteering. Even diluted conspiratorial thinking has a negative impact. Repeatedly it’s shown that those who are less trusting are more disconnected: from politics, the news around them and general society. I have seen first-hand how a loss of faith saps energy and produces a bitter political indifference. Clearly, simply entreating people to realign with concrete political organisations isn’t the solution to restore trust (or how democracy works). Hoping that national politics will clean itself up on its own doesn’t seem likely either. Once more, the answer is probably, frustratingly, pick and mix: political education; reminding yourself that sometimes incompetence is a more likely explanation than some clever scheme; getting involved locally with a cause that channels vague resentment into positive politics. A multi-pronged approach. Conspiratorial thinking is easy enough to understand but we need to resist inventing shadowy new monsters to slay. The ones we already have are dangerous enough.

4/18/2022,"Harrison Birtwistle, one of the UK’s foremost composers, has died aged 87. Birtwistle’s compositions of uncompromising modernism – ranging from large-scale grand opera to intimate solo piano pieces – have dominated British music for more than five decades. He was born in Accrington in 1934, and as a young clarinettist played in theatre bands and began composing. He studied in Manchester at the Royal Northern College of Music, where, along with his fellow students Alexander Goehr and Peter Maxwell Davies, he was part of an explosion of musical creativity, and belonged to a group once labelled “the Manchester School”. His first chamber opera, Punch and Judy, premiered at the Aldeburgh festival in 1968, and legend has it that the violence of its story and music outraged much of its audience, including festival founder Benjamin Britten who apparently left at the interval. (Birtwistle himself directed a revival of the opera at the festival in June 1991.) The Triumph of Time, in 1972, inspired by a woodcut of the same name by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, secured his international reputation and remains one of his best-known works. In 1975, Birtwistle became musical director of the newly established Royal National Theatre in London, where his duties included teaching Simon Callow, playing Mozart in the premiere of Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus, to play the piano convincingly. Birtwistle received a knighthood in 1988 and was made a Companion of Honour in 2001. If Birtwistle’s dissonant and jagged music can feel uncompromisingly aggressive, it also packs a huge emotional punch and is exhilarating and intricate. Much of his work drew on his love of poetry and language and he found inspiration in myths, ritual and folklore. An opera, Gawain, took the Middle English romance of the Arthurian knight as its source; 2008’s The Minotaur retold the Greek legend, and The Mask of Orpheus (1986) explored the Orpheus myth. He achieved national notoriety in 1995 when his saxophone concerto, Panic, premiered at the Last Night of the Proms. The work – the first piece of contemporary music that had ever appeared on a Last Night programme – had been scheduled for the concert’s second half, and thus was broadcast live on a Saturday night to millions of viewers on BBC One. The work’s abrasive energy and raucous and violent soundworld was labelled a “horrible cacophony” by some reviewers and the BBC switchboard was jammed with complaints from viewers that their ears had been assaulted. Birtwistle continued composing into his 70s and 80s. His 2019 Duet for Eight Strings was nominated for a Basca-Ivors composers award (his 10th nomination); the Moth Requiem for female voices, harps and flute, premiered in the UK at the 2013 Proms and won a Royal Philharmonic Society award – his fifth, making him the most honoured musician in RPS awards’ history. “One of the beautiful and most intensely personal of his recent scores,” wrote the Guardian’s Andrew Clements. Many conductors championed his music, including Pierre Boulez, Simon Rattle, Daniel Barenboim and Antonio Pappano. Desperately sad news about Harry Birtwistle. A privilege to have known him and worked with him. And what a legacy - not least the 4 operas premiered @SnapeMaltings @BrittenPears. Colossal figure and an inspiration. Will be sorely missed. Among those paying tribute on Twitter were Aldeburgh Music’s Roger Wright, and conductor Nicholas Collon, who said “what a visionary, what a virtuoso, what an inspiration”. Australian composer Liza Lim wrote: “He was a crucial composer for me: Secret Theatre, Earth Dances, Mask of Orpheus amongst other great works.”",Arts/Music,Composer Harrison Birtwistle dies aged 87,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/18/composer-harrison-birtwistle-dies-aged-87
4/18/2022,"As the rock’n’roll era took shape in the late 1940s, emerging from a raucous new blend of blues and jazz played for dancers in the night clubs of black America, the executives at major record labels initially turned up their noses. It was left to such figures as Art Rupe to exploit the opportunity and provide the means of getting the music to a wider audience via juke boxes and radio stations. Rupe, who has died aged 104, was a record man, as the founders of such independent companies as Atlantic, Chess, Savoy, King and Modern were known. His own label, Specialty Records, became the vehicle for the early hits of Little Richard – including Tutti Frutti, Long Tall Sally and Rip It Up – and the recordings with which Sam Cooke conquered the gospel-music audience as the young lead singer with the Soul Stirrers. Among Specialty’s other hit artists in a decade of success were the singers Lloyd Price, Larry Williams and Percy Mayfield and gospel groups including the Pilgrim Travelers and the Swan Silvertones. Knowledgable music fans of the time came to view the yellow, black and white label on a Specialty 78 or 45 rpm disc as a virtual guarantee of quality. Born Arthur Goldberg in Greensburg, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to David Goldberg, a secondhand furniture salesman, and his wife, Anna, Art was educated at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In 1939, aged 22, he moved to Los Angeles, where he began studying business at UCLA with the intention of entering the film industry. His studies were interrupted by the second world war, during which he worked in a dockyard, repairing the Liberty ships that transported troops and equipment. Failing to break into the movie industry, he tried the music business, changing his surname to a version of Ropp, the name of his German immigrant forebears. He helped found Juke Box Records, which had a national hit with RM Blues by Roy Milton and his Solid Senders before Rupe left his business partners to found Specialty in 1946. He became a student of every aspect of the business, including the music. Carefully analysing current hits, he paid scrupulous attention to the quality of his own records. He believed in using studios with the best atmosphere and equipment, selecting the most accomplished musicians and treating them well in the studio in order to elicit their best performances. “Above all technique does not mean anything if is the song is not sung and the music is not played WITH FEELING,” he wrote in a set of instructions to his employees. Such feeling was a hallmark of Specialty’s early hits in the renamed rhythm and blues chart, including Joe Liggins’s Pink Champagne, Mayfield’s Please Send Me Someone to Love and Guitar Slim’s The Things That I Used to Do. On a trip to New Orleans in 1952 he recorded the teenaged Lloyd Price singing Lawdy Miss Clawdy, which was named R&B record of the year. New Orleans became a fruitful source of material and three years later he sent the producer Robert “Bumps” Blackwell to the city to record Richard Penniman, a singer from Macon, Georgia, whose voice he had heard on a demo tape. In the last 15 minutes of the three-hour session they recorded a cleaned-up version of a salacious song called Tutti Frutti, with which, as Little Richard, Penniman would finally make the sound of rock’n’roll match the older generation’s worst fears. In common with most of his competitors, Rupe paid extremely low royalties, telling his artists that hit records would raise their income from live performances. But at least he usually paid up, unlike some, although in 1959 Little Richard sued him and was awarded $11,000 in back royalties. Rupe was unusual in his detestation of the widespread bribery of disc jockeys. Known as payola, the system was at its height in 1957 when he responded to a particularly outrageous demand by cancelling the appearance of one of his artists on the nationally televised American Bandstand show. That same year Little Richard told the world that he was renouncing show business to enter the church. Almost simultaneously, Sam Cooke was heading in the opposite direction. Rupe, who loved the way gospel-trained singers brought raw emotion to pop music, was not pleased when Cooke recorded a set of ballads in a smooth style that he considered bland. His reaction was to release the singer from his contract and allow him to take the rejected recordings elsewhere. One of the songs, You Send Me, was soon shooting to the top of the national charts on another label and laying the foundation for Cooke’s huge success as a solo artist. It was an expensive decision for Rupe, but one based on a refusal to compromise his musical standards. He stepped back at the end of the 50s to pursue business interests in oil and land, and in 1990 he sold Specialty and its rich catalogue to Fantasy Records. Having returned to UCLA to complete his degree, he set up the Arthur N Rupe Foundation, which supported projects under the rubric “creative solutions for societal issues”. In 2011 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Rupe married three times. His third wife, Dorothy, predeceased him. He is survived by a daughter, Beverly, from his second marriage, to Lee Apostoleris, which ended in divorce, and by a granddaughter, Madeline.

The director is climber and documentary-maker Eliza Kubarska whose film follows Ngada, who has eight Everest ascents under his belt. He is agonising about whether to guide a trio of experienced climbers – two Russians and a Pole – on an expedition to the unclimbed eastern face of Kumbhakarna, a more dangerous and difficult climb than Everest. The reason Ngada is willing to risk it is that his 16-year-old son, Dawa, is a gifted student who dreams of becoming a doctor, but there is no money to pay for his education. Some of the scenes in the family’s home feel staged, or at least reconstructed, as Ngada and his wife, Jomdoe, bicker about whether he should take the Kumbhakarna job. Jomdoe cooks for Ngada’s expeditions and is no slouch. While pregnant she lugged a 25kg load to base camp; she says it’s mad to climb the mountain. You can see her point when Kumbhakarna looms into view, a fearsome hulk of rock and ice. The expedition is plagued by heavy snowfall and Ngada wants to call it a day, fearing an avalanche, but if he doesn’t climb, he doesn’t get paid. The trio press ahead. This is a balanced film that doesn’t pick sides. But Kubarska is asking us to consider the ethical issues involved when foreign mountaineers expect Sherpas to take huge risks in pursuit of their conquests. It’s virtually impossible not to sympathise with the Sherpas who are dressed in inferior gear and carry loads weighing up to 50kg to base camp in thigh-deep snow – one guy is bent double with a package the size of a fridge strapped to his back.  The Wall of Shadows is released on 22 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Wall of Shadows review – climbing film overturns smiling Sherpa stereotype,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/18/the-wall-of-shadows-review-climbing-film-subverts-smiling-sherpa-stereotype
4/18/2022,"Visitors to this week’s Venice Biennale will get a sneak preview of a long-abandoned island in the Venice lagoon that is being transformed into an artistic centre. San Giacomo in Paludo sits in the north of the lagoon, between Murano and Burano, and first sprung to life in 1046 when Doge Orso Badoer II donated it for the construction of a monastery. It was then used as a refuge for pilgrims and friars, passing through several monastic orders before briefly serving as a quarantine island in the 15th century and eventually being handed over to the Franciscans until they were vanquished in 1769. San Giacomo in Paludo, which is spread over an area of 12,496 sq metres, later served as a military post and a place to store gunpowder before being abandoned in 1961, mostly in ruins. The island was put up for sale by the Italian state in 2018, on condition that its new owner would use it for cultural purposes, and eventually bought by the arts collector, Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, and her husband, Agostino Re Rebaudengo. The couple foresee the island being used as a cultural space for exhibitions, concerts, theatrical performances and artists’ residency programmes, as well as providing a base for renewable energy research activities. “This connection between art and energy is a little bit like a rebirth,” Sandretto told La Stampa. “We like to think that all the layers that make up this tiny islet will re-emerge, with their own character.” She added: “In some way, this land will return to its origins – it welcomed travellers, and it will do so again.” Although some of the structures on the island, which can currently only be accessed by private boat, were fairly intact when the couple bought the island, it will be some time before the project reaches its full potential. However, some of the space is ready to host its first event – a show by the Brazilian performance artist, Jota Mombaça – on 21 April, as part of the 2022 Venice Biennale, which officially begins on Saturday. Mombaça’s show will be just a taster before works continue and the island prepares to officially open, possibly in 2024. Sandretto said a house for her and her family is also being established on the island, but as per the rules, there will be no hotels. “We want to spend time there, to live on it because otherwise we would lose the sense of it,” she said. “We don’t care at all to be all alone in a place far from everything.” The 59th edition of the Venice Biennale was pushed back from 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The show is being overseen by the Italian curator, Cecilia Alemani, and will run until 27 November.",Arts/Art and design,Art lovers to get sneak preview of island ‘rebirth’ at Venice Biennale,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/18/art-lovers-to-get-sneak-preview-of-island-rebirth-at-venice-biennale
4/18/2022,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after Ministry of Defence police officers were confronted close to Buckingham Palace and government buildings in central London. The Metropolitan police said officers used a Taser electrical weapon during the incident on Horse Guards Parade at about 8.50am on Monday. The Met said there were no reports of any injuries and the incident was not being treated as terror-related. A man was restrained and arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon and is in custody at a central London police station. The Met said an investigation into the incident had been launched and its officers were liaising closely with the Ministry of Defence police as it progressed. It appealed for any witnesses to come forward. Horse Guards Parade runs from Whitehall to St James Park and is a tourist attraction that hosts trooping the colour each year on the Queen’s official birthday in June. Whitehall is home to several government departments, including the MoD and Foreign Office. Downing Street, which is home to the prime minister, is off Whitehall and close to Horse Guards Parade. BBC Radio London reported that Whitehall, which runs between Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square, was closed because of the incident, with buses being diverted away from the scene.",News/UK news,Attempted murder arrest after police confronted by armed man in London,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/18/man-armed-knife-arrested-confronting-mod-police-horse-guards-parade-london
4/18/2022,"Piers Morgan has compared himself to Nelson Mandela, claiming his year away from TV presenting and his battle for “free speech” is similar to the former South African leader’s struggle against apartheid. The former tabloid editor stormed off the set and out of his job at Good Morning Britain after being engaged in public debate when he said he did not believe the Duchess of Sussex’s claims from her Oprah Winfrey interview. Morgan has recently sought to paint his GMB exit as the result of an effort to silence him. Speaking before the launch of his new show, he said: “I feel like Nelson Mandela when he came out of prison. It’s like the long walk to free speech freedom.” Morgan walked out of GMB last March after being asked to account for his on-air comments about Meghan. He had cast doubt on Meghan’s statement during the interview with Winfrey that she had been denied help with mental health concerns, saying he found her untrustworthy. Several of Morgan’s colleagues, as well as Meghan herself, complained to senior ITV management that his use of such a prominent stage to discredit someone reporting mental health problems could deter other people from seeking help. Morgan later agreed to address that on air. He was challenged by his co-presenter Alex Beresford, who suggested Morgan had been motivated by the duchess having previously made it clear to him she did not want to be his friend. The episode prompted tens of thousands of complaints to the broadcast regulator Ofcom, which said Morgan’s remarks were “potentially harmful” but did not breach its rules, and ITV bosses reportedly wanted Morgan to apologise. Now the presenter has claimed his new show on the Rupert Murdoch-owned TalkTV will “be standing up for democracy”, adding: “I want to uncancel those who have been cancelled. I want to basically make a point that cancel culture is as dangerous to society, in its own way, in terms of its attack on free speech and freedom of expression as coronavirus has been.” He said his exit from ITV had been a farce but, as a result, “we’ve ended up with a whole network which is now dedicated to preventing that kind of farce from recurring”. Speaking alongside Sharon Osbourne, one of his co-presenters, he added: “You shouldn’t be shamed or vilified or cancelled for having an opinion, unless you genuinely are spewing hateful bigoted stuff.” Morgan, who left his job as editor of the Daily Mirror in disgrace after being found to have published faked photographs that purported to show British service personnel abusing Iraqi prisoners, will present the show Uncensored, with Osbourne and the former Sun political editor Tom Newton Dunn, on 25 April.",News/Media,Piers Morgan compares himself to Nelson Mandela,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/18/piers-morgan-compares-himself-nelson-mandela-free-speech
