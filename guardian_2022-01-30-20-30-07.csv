1/30/2022,"Governments underestimate the power of celebrity at their peril. First it was Marcus Rashford and his campaign for hungry children. Now it is Jack Monroe pointing out how the official inflation figure bears no relation to the real cost of living increases facing the neediest households. The footballer and the chef have performed an important public service by highlighting, in a way that official statistics and thinktank reports can’t, just how tough life is on or close to the breadline.  It is often said Britain is a wealthy country, which indeed it is. But if you rely on food banks it doesn’t really matter if house prices are going up and the stock market is booming. The poorest 10% of households in the UK have negative net wealth, because their debts are higher than the assets they own. Monroe’s point about inflation is well made. The official measure of the cost of living does not reflect the lived experience of people across Britain and was never intended to. The consumer prices index doesn’t show whether those on low incomes are being affected by supermarkets cutting back on value ranges. Nor does it reflect the fact that richer households have savings to draw upon when times get tough. What’s more, as the Resolution Foundation has pointed out, soaring energy prices act as a form of deeply regressive tax, with the poorest households hit hardest. This is the background to the deepening cost of living crisis and what the government should do about it. One thing is already obvious: a toxic brew of rising housing costs, dearer energy and higher taxes means ministers have to come up with something. Doing nothing is only an option if they are prepared to risk oblivion at the next election. Certain things are set in stone. Next week the regulator Ofgem will raise its price cap in response to the sharp rise in the global wholesale price of gas. Energy suppliers will be able to adjust their tariffs from April and the indications are the average household will be paying £600 a year more unless the government steps in to help. Higher interest rates from the Bank of England are also inevitable and it would be a surprise if interest rates did not go up by 0.25 points to 0.5% this week. There is the likelihood of further increases as the year wears on. Despite the opposition of many Tory MPs, the planned increase in national insurance contributions – the £12bn health and social care levy – also appears to be done and dusted. Rishi Sunak could use the better than expected public borrowing figures to delay the increase by a year or abandon it altogether. Indeed, there is an argument that the Treasury would do better to allow the economy to get up a head of steam after the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic rather than putting the squeeze on too quickly. That was what George Osborne did after the financial crisis, with the result that the economy slowed and deficit-reduction targets were missed. Neither option appeals to the chancellor. Delaying the national insurance increase until 2023 would bring its introduction a year closer to the next election, and Sunak would prefer to be cutting not raising taxes by then. Scrapping the increase altogether would represent the sort of fiscal laxity the Treasury has traditionally loathed: governments spending money but reluctant to impose the tax increases needed to pay for them. Sunak is definitely not a fan of the idea that the only real constraint on government spending is inflation, and that the Bank of England can always print more money to pay the state’s bills. Boris Johnson sometimes gives the impression he is a fan of modern monetary theory and, in any case, has a different time horizon to that of the chancellor. But this weekend’s joint article by the prime minister and the chancellor in the Sunday Times saying the national insurance increase “must go ahead” puts the issue to bed. Sunak will have his way – but at a cost. It will not be easy for the government to dig itself out of a deep hole but the priority should be to help those on low and middle incomes cope with rising energy bills. There is money available to do this because the scarring from the pandemic has been a lot less severe than originally feared. On some estimates, Sunak has £50bn to play with, easily enough to counter the energy crisis. Labour has proposed making the warm home discount more generous and expanding the number of people eligible to receive it. This makes sense, as does the idea of cutting VAT on energy bills, a move that would help all households. Although Sunak will get his national insurance increase, it is bad economics as well as bad politics. The levy is a tax on jobs and inflationary, because businesses will either employ fewer workers or try to pass on higher costs to their customers. Income inequality is high in the UK but wealth inequality is even higher, and it gets harder to make the case that capital gains should be taxed more lightly than income when those paid modest sums are being asked to pay more national insurance or are having their personal allowance frozen. The cost of living crisis is happening and if the government is too timid in response, the economy will struggle to cope with rising energy bills, higher taxes and falling real incomes. There is a risk demand will slow from the spring onwards once the short-term boost from easing Covid-19 restrictions has played out. Concerns about higher debt interest payments that come from rising inflation may then be the least of the chancellor’s worries.",News/Business,Failure to help struggling households will cost Tories dear | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/failure-to-help-struggling-households-will-cost-tories-dear
1/30/2022,"There’s more than a spectacular sunset to watch on the Solway Firth. The coastline that separates England from Scotland is also renowned for its birdlife – herons, oystercatchers and short-eared owls are often seen along the banks. At sundown, the low cliffs and hills of the Scottish coast glower against a vast sky shot through with rose-yellow hues, with the swathe of sand glowing in the last of the rays. Stay at the Steamboat Inn, right on the shoreline on the Scottish side, for unfussy pub dishes and simple but comfortable rooms – but world-class views (doubles from £110 B&B, thesteamboatinn.co.uk).  Rising up like a giant wave, the East Sussex Downs come to a peak at Ditchling Beacon, offering spectacular views southwards to the sea and northwards over the wooded Sussex countryside. On a clear day, the sky floods apricot and pink over Devil’s Dyke and mid-Sussex as the sun sinks below the horizon, flooding the sea with a vivid, gold light. The Beacon is five minutes’ drive (or a stiff uphill walk) from Ditchling village, where the Green Welly café (thegreenwellycafe.co.uk) does an excellent line in restorative tea and cake, and the Bull offers classic pub dishes and stylish rooms (doubles from £119, room only, thebullditchling.com). Walk from the visitor centre at Libanus on to Mynydd Illtyd Common, a wide open space swathed in heather and bracken, that offers 360-degree views of the surrounding peaks. Head to the vantage point at Twyn y Gaer to see Pen y Fan – the region’s highest mountain – blaze with rust-coloured hues in the last of the light, while the forests and hills in the westerly direction slowly fade to silhouette. Warm up with a stay at Peterstone Court, a country house hotel on the outskirts of Brecon with a cellar spa and a fine dining restaurant (doubles from £170 B&B, peterstone-court.com). Talisker is a photographer’s dream of a beach, with a long, sweeping arc of sand and a rocky shoreline of black boulders that provides an ideal foreground to the flaming skies beyond. The beach faces due west so on a clear winter’s day the outline of South Uist – the second largest of the Outer Hebrides – is set against the horizon as the sun gradually disappears. It’s a bit of a drive to Talisker, so reward yourself with a stay at the Broadford Hotel, with leather Chesterfields in the bar and wonderful dinners of locally caught seafood (doubles from £85 B&B, broadfordhotel.co.uk). The ever-changing London skyline is at its most eye-catching at sunset, when the towers, spindles and historic domes are silhouetted against a flaming sky. Take the riverboat to Greenwich Park for widescreen views from the City and Canary Wharf to the London Eye. Spend the hours before sundown dipping into Greenwich’s bustling market, or discovering Britain’s seafaring history at the National Maritime Museum and the Cutty Sark (rmg.co.uk). Stay at the Pilot, which has 10 individually designed bedrooms and a buzzy, open-plan kitchen (doubles from £139 B&B, pilotgreenwich.co.uk). Last year, Sandbanks was voted the best sunset-watching spot in the UK, and this long spit of sand, leading to one of the country’s most exclusive (and expensive) communities, offers plenty to do on a wintry beach day. Hop on the ferry to Studland Bay, and explore the romantic ruins of Corfe Castle before hot chips, eaten walking along the sands on Shell Bay. Time the return journey to watch the sunset from the water – but be quick, the crossing takes around four minutes. Stay at the Hotel du Vin in Poole, with a buzzy brasserie and wine cellars (doubles from £95 room only, hotelduvin.com). Wear plenty of layers, take flasks of coffee and get your phone ready for glorious, windswept sunsets on a walk out to Zennor Head, a 750-metre long promontory stretching into the roaring Atlantic Ocean. Park in Zennor village and follow the coastal path to the headland, keeping an eye out for kestrels on the clifftop, and seals bobbing in the waters below. Book into the Gurnard’s Head, unmissable with its egg yolk-yellow frontage, for tangy fish soups, hearty meat dishes and indulgent puds, all made with locally-sourced ingredients. Afterwards, retire upstairs to one of the eight super-cosy rooms (doubles from £142.50 B&B, gurnardshead.co.uk). The highest point in the Cotswolds near one of its prettiest villages, at 312 metres above sea level, this former folly boasts 60-mile views across 16 counties. At sunset, watch the sun drop behind the Welsh skyline, the river Severn glowing in the half-light, and pick out Oxford’s gleaming spires. There’s a lovely circular walk, a visitor centre, shop and espresso bar in the Tower Barn. Stay at the 16th-century Broadway Hotel, with slick contemporary rooms (doubles from £99 B&B, broadway-hotel.co.uk). A three-mile long, constantly moving spit of sand between the North Sea and the Humber estuary, Spurn Point offers some of the most spectacular skies in the country. Pop into the visitor centre before strolling along the sands. At sunset the sea floods gold, roe deer skitter across the scrub and you may even see porpoises bobbing in the water. Check into the Dunedin Country House, a charming Georgian manor within walking distance of the picturesque village of near Packington (doubles from £120 B&B, dunedincountryhouse.co.uk). The three-mile stretch of sand at Rhossili Bay is pretty spectacular at any time, but sunset ups the ante several notches. The beach faces due west, which means front row seats for a flaming winter sky that turns the sea a deep, metallic teal. It’s easy to spend a whole day on Rhossili – at low tide, walk across the causeway to the rocky Worm’s Head island to get a fantastic perspective on the entire stretch of beach. Stay at the Worm’s Head Hotel, right above the bay, to watch the sunset from the privacy of your own balcony – or from its hearty food-serving restaurant (bay view doubles from £93 B&B, thewormshead.co.uk).",Lifestyle/Travel,Top 10 places in the UK for spectacular sunsets,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/30/top-10-places-in-the-uk-for-spectacular-sunsets
1/30/2022,"Two of documentary cinema’s current fascinations – the foibles of the super-wealthy and the environmental cost of our way of living – are brought together in this extraordinary, savagely poetic film. In the republic of Georgia, a billionaire – the former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili – has a hobby. He collects trees. But not just any trees: he favours huge, ancient and rare examples that have been a constant in the lives of the people of the Black Sea coast for generations. The chosen trees are gouged out of the ground, leaving raw gashes of stripped topsoil, and transported at vast expense and inconvenience to their new home, the Shekvetili Dendrological Park. Ivanishvili is absent from the film, but his autocratic whims – part folly, part power flex – are the subject of much debate among the Georgian people. Some are gung-ho: he builds roads in order to transport the trees, improving the infrastructure of the area, they argue. More often, though, they weep over the aftermath of this ego-driven environmental vandalism.

1/30/2022,"When VC Andrews’s debut novel, Flowers in the Attic, was published in 1979, it was not well received by all critics: one described it as “possibly the worst book I have ever read”. However, her gothic horror-romance about four children who are locked in an attic for three years by their beautiful, conniving mother – who seems loving but actually starves and poisons them – went on to sell more than 40 million copies, was on the New York Times bestseller list for 14 weeks and is still in print more than 40 years later.  Now, startling parallels between the lives of the children imprisoned in the attic and Virginia Andrews’s own life as a severely disabled woman are to be laid bare for the first time in a forthcoming biography, The Woman Beyond the Attic. The book claims that when Andrews – who spent most of her adult life housebound in a wheelchair – was disobedient, her “controlling” mother would imprison her in her bedroom and deprive her of a meal as a punishment. “Her mother would lock her in her room and not give her dinner, if she got angry at her,” said Andrew Neiderman, author of the new biography, which will be published on Thursday. “She controlled who Virginia could see, what she could do and punished her for not doing what she wanted.” Andrews suffered from rheumatoid arthritis but lived a relatively independent life before a surgical treatment in her late teens left her unable to walk and move her neck without pain. By the time Flowers in the Attic was published, Andrews was 56 and had been dependent on her mother, Lillian, for decades. “She was trapped,” said Neiderman. Like the children in Flowers in the Attic, “her mother kept her under lock and key. Firstly, because she was ashamed of her for being disabled, and secondly, because she couldn’t handle it [Andrews’s disability].” For example, Lillian “made sure” Andrews always wore clothes that covered up her wheelchair in a way that would hide her disability from visitors. She placed her daughter’s chair behind bushes when Andrews sat on the front porch so that passers-by would not see her. “She didn’t want people looking at her.” Since Andrews “hated” her disability, she went along with her mother’s attempts at “disguising” her wheelchair, Neiderman said. “She thought that when people looked at her and saw her illness, they looked at her as ugly.” It was her mother who taught her to feel that way, he said: “If, as a child, your mother wants to hide you, obviously it is going to affect the way you look at yourself.” Neiderman became Andrews’s ghostwriter following her death from breast cancer in 1986, completing her unfinished manuscripts and penning 96 bestselling novels in her style under her name, approved by her estate. Many of the revelations contained in the book emerged from his interviews with her closest living relatives, who also gave him unprecedented access to Andrews’s personal letters. “I said to them: I think it’s time to write her biography, but I need all the little details, all the personal letters and the personal information. And they agreed.” Andrews always maintained that the plot of Flowers in the Attic was “a fictionalised version of a true story” that a hospital doctor had told her when she was a teenager. But as an isolated disabled woman, reliant on her mother’s care, “she felt so trapped by her illness – and was so incarcerated by her mother sometimes – that she could understand how children would feel locked up in an attic,” believes Neiderman. In the filicidal novel, which Andrews dedicated to her mother, Cathy becomes a sexually frustrated teenager after years of being confined in the attic with just her siblings for company. She is then raped by her older brother. Like Cathy, Andrews would have known how it felt to be penned up and sexually frustrated: “Even though she was in her 50s, she thought like a young girl because she didn’t have adult experiences with men.” Her mother had prevented her from going on dates as a young woman. “When she was writing, she interviewed her [adult] niece about sex – because she had no idea about it.” She asked her niece to tell her how it felt to have sex and what the experience was like, emotionally and physically, he said. Because Lillian could not drive and the family had very little money, Andrews rarely left her home: “It was very difficult for her to move about,” said Neiderman. He does not think Andrews even had access to a garden for some of her life – like the children in the attic, who make paper flowers in an attempt to turn their prison into an imaginary garden. It wasn’t until Andrews achieved fame and fortune as a novelist that her living conditions as a disabled person improved – but even in 1980, a journalist who interviewed her wrote: “Her only companion is her mother.” By 1981, Andrews had moved into an 11-bedroom mansion but despite her success, another journalist, Stephen Rubin of the Washington Post, noticed that during an interview, she “always returns to the subjects that seem to preoccupy her most – her wheelchair and her mother”. When Rubin questions her about her relationship with her mother, who fusses constantly over Andrews and seems to him “an adorable little old lady”, she tells him, darkly: “Mothers wear two faces like most people.” When Flowers in the Attic celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2019, it had become a global bestseller. Andrews’s mother, however, never read it. “She wouldn’t read her books, she wouldn’t read anything she wrote,” said Neiderman. She did not encourage her, either. “It wasn’t until Virginia became famous and did readings and book signings and a trip to Europe that her mother respected her as a writer.” At that point, her mother became “proud” of her, he said. “Yes, Virginia Andrews had a difficult life. But the thing about her is: she overcame it all – and went on to have one of the biggest successes of commercial fiction.”",Arts/Books,Out of sight: how Flowers in the Attic mirrored its author’s captivity,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/out-of-sight-how-flowers-in-the-attic-mirrored-its-authors-captivity
1/30/2022,"Leah Swift, an 18-year-old college student in West Virginia, bought her first Squishmallow in October 2020. Less than two years later, she has amassed 350 of the cute, cuddly toys, which overflow from the shelves of her small bedroom. Swift regularly posts videos about her vast collection on TikTok, where she’s garnered nearly 400,000 followers and 11m likes.  “It’s gotten to the point where people will stop me on campus and ask if I am the Squishmallow girl from TikTok,” she said. “It’s crazy. When I started making these videos, I never thought it would be this big of a deal.” Squishmallows, a line of whimsical and rounded stuffed creatures launched by the toy company Kellytoy in 2017, have boomed in popularity in recent years. Much like Beanie Babies in the 1990s, the toys have sparked a fanatical following of Squishmallow “hunters” who flock to stores in search of new and rare models. But the craze has also been beset by controversy, as rising demand fuels a pricey black market for Squishmallow resales. Scalpers report making as much as six figures a year buying up and flipping the toys, which critics say is stripping shelves bare for genuine collectors. Now, Squishmallow influencers like Swift have found themselves pulled into a debate over the etiquette of buying and reselling the toys. Swift bought her first Squishmallow, a strawberry-shaped toy named Scarlet, for just $5. The same model now goes for as much as $25 on resale sites like Depop and Mercari. Swift estimates she could resell her collection for about $3,000 total at today’s scalping prices – but would not dream of it. “I am against reselling Squishmallows for any more than their retail value,” she said. “There are people who get into the space for all the wrong reasons, and it is having a very negative impact on the community.” When a user named Juliana Lynn posted a video in December 2021 claiming to have made $100,000 in the last year from resales, her page was flooded with negative comments from people who say scalping Squishmallows drives up prices and undermines true hobbyists. “This disgusts me. People like you ruin it for kids/people that genuinely enjoy them,” one comment said. “You’re a shelf clearing price gouger,” another read. “Just so you know the people in the Squish community despise ppl like you.” Lynn did not respond to multiple requests for comment but defended herself on her own page, calling it a “side hustle” and nothing more. “I don’t do this for attention,” she wrote. “I do it for fun and extra cash.” Despite the debate over reselling, the trend shows no sign of slowing down. Kellytoy sold 50m Squishmallows betewen February 2020 and October 2021, according to the toy trade publication the Toy Book – bringing the total number sold to over 100m since their launch. Largely fuelled by social media, platforms like Instagram, Reddit and TikTok now host Squishmallow communities comprising thousands of users. But the meteoric rise has prompted some to consider quitting the scene altogether. Melanie Schroeder, a California-based college student, started collecting in August 2020 and now has 400 toys, but she says the price gouging has overshadowed the hobby’s originally playful nature. “Unfortunately a lot of people are no longer collecting because they are so tired of resellers clearing shelves and price gouging,” she said. “It takes a lot of the fun out of it.” While Schroeder is personally against resale, she has found other ways to cash in on her new hobby, having signed up for TikTok’s creator fund after her Squishmallow TikTok account blew up in recent months, amassing more than 400,000 likes. Influencers on the platform can make as much as $50 per video depending on its view count. Schroeder attributes the huge rise in Squishmallow popularity to upheaval brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and its emotional impact – particularly among young people. “For me personally, if I am sad, I go Squish hunting,” she said. “They’re so squishy and cuddly and cute and have brought so much comfort and joy to people through the last couple of years.”",Lifestyle/Life and style, Squishmallows: cuddly toys fuel an obsession – and a scalping crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/30/squishmallows-toys-collecting-scalping
1/30/2022,"Only five women have sat on the US supreme court in its 232 years. Not one has been a Black woman – but that is now set to change. The retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer has given Joe Biden a unique opportunity and if, as pledged, he chooses a Black woman to replace the 83-year-old, the US president will not only be making history, but recognizing the power of a core constituency.  Biden won the support of close to 90% of Black female voters as a key piece of his 2020 victory over Donald Trump and, as the Democrats’ most loyal group, they have voted at a higher rate than any other demographic in the past five presidential elections. Biden said he will select his nominee by the end of February, but an informal slate of contenders is already doing the rounds. “We all know it’s way past time. He made that commitment and he’s delivering. I think that’s a great thing close to 240 years later,” Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and convener of the Black Woman’s Roundtable empowerment program, said. She added: “The fact that there’s never been a Black woman on that court – it’s a feat in itself that we’re finally at this table.” Guy-Uriel Charles, founding director of the center on law, race and politics at Duke University and a law professor at Harvard, called the prospect of the new supreme court justice “absolutely historic” and on a par with Kamala Harris becoming vice- president. And on the court, he said: “The parallel would then be to Thurgood Marshall, the first Black man. To have a Black woman [at] the highest reaches of the profession means something for not just Black people but Black women in particular and having representation one can identify.” Black voters in South Carolina turned around Biden’s sinking campaign in the 2020 primaries and, in the election itself, Black voters made the difference for him in several key states that Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016, namely Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Biden acknowledged that they had had his back and in return promised: “I’ll have yours.” The constituency is vital for Democrats in many state as well as national elections. In Virginia in 2021, for example, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s gubernatorial victory was in part secured by the fact that his opponent, party veteran and former governor Terry McAuliffe, was unable to earn the full and enthusiastic support of Black voters. Now Breyer’s retirement announcement arrives amid discontent among Black voters and activists as the Democratic-controlled Congress persistently fails to pass voting rights protections, while racist voter suppression and map-rigging are rampant in many red states. Meanwhile, any Biden pick joining the liberal wing of the court will find themselves, alongside Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, comprehensively outnumbered by the conservative super-majority achieved under Trump, writing scorching dissents as American law is forced further right. Nonetheless, advocates of equity and diversity are not going to downplay the moment. Ohio Democratic congresswoman Joyce Beatty, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement: “We know that when America’s boardrooms, legislatures, and even the supreme court start to resemble America, we all benefit,” and she urged confirmation of whomever is put forward “without any unnecessary delay”. Biden has revealed no names, but he said at the White House last Thursday: “The person I will nominate will be a person of extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity”. That didn’t stop instant conservative sniping, which prompted Jatia Wrighten, an assistant professor in Virginia Commonwealth University’s political science department, to lament that the US is “really not as far along as we would like to think”. “A lot of the pushback already is ‘Why this focus on race – is this another form of affirmative action?’,” she said, saying such an attitude “highlights a blindspot in American political history” after centuries of white men as the norm on the court. To boot, only five of around 300 federal appellate judges in the US were Black women when Biden became president. He appointed five more in his first year. Wrighten added: “Pundits and legislators and congressional members were saying things like ‘is this person even going to be qualified?’ This idea that if it’s a Black woman in some way she’s not qualified when in the last days of Trump’s presidency they had the audacity to push through Amy Coney Barrett who really had little experience in that realm in comparison to other supreme court justices,” she said. And she asked: “Why have we not seen more diversity on the supreme court that actually reflects the population that live in this country? “The question should be: Why hasn’t this been a question before?”",News/Law,Black voters secured Joe Biden’s 2020 win.

1/30/2022,"Mark Hodkinson was born in a “modest, boxy” house in a Manchester suburb. There was one book in the house, kept on the top of a wardrobe with other revered items such as his cycling proficiency certificate. The book was Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain, and Hodkinson writes that: “When I see the front cover again, an illustration of Cernunnos, the Celtic horned god, looking startled and irked … I fall through time.” Hodkinson’s family moved to Rochdale in the mid-1970s, when he was 10, and he still lives there. He became not only a working-class reader – as per the subtitle of this book – but also a working-class publisher and writer too, which makes him a very rare bird.  The upper-middle-class grip on British literature may be stronger than ever today, working classness being, as Hodkinson writes, “disavowed and discarded” in favour of an American notion of aspiration. Accounts of working-class life must be smuggled under flags of convenience. Hodkinson lists them: “female, ‘misery lit’, black, ethnic, gay, Welsh, Scottish or Irish.” And of course the working classes are more elusive these days. Of 70s Rochdale, Hodkinson writes: “Many streets had mills on them, standing tall and wide like battleships, completely out of scale with the rest of the surroundings”, whereas Rochdale now is “Anytown UK … spotted with litter-strewn retail parks”. Working-class writers did get a look-in during the 50s and 60s, when prosperity and permissiveness shook up factory life and the social-realist “kitchen sink” genre emerged, mainly in the north. The young Hodkinson read those books but found the protagonists too earthbound, too fixed in their northern locales. They were not the inspiration of his writing and reading, nor the reason he has now accumulated 3,500 books. He has none of the chippiness afflicting some of the kitchen sinkers; he is not out for revenge. Instead, he’s a dreamer. He reads to be “spirited away from reality”. We see the young Hodkinson lying in bed “with books fanned out around me like numbers on a giant clock”. His reading is of a piece with his “thinking while drifting, across wasteland and cemeteries”. He once consulted a therapist (because he’d got a bit worried about having so many books), who told him they were his metaphorical friends. I know Hodkinson slightly. Like him, I was born in a modest, boxy house in the north (there were about 10 books in ours). Perhaps that’s why I so enjoyed the way he talks about literature, some negative remarks about one of my own works excepted. On a snowy day in Rochdale, the young Hodkinson reads The Outsider by Albert Camus. In his head he is in dusty Algiers – “the fig trees, the red sky” – watching the sea sending “long, lazy” waves across the sand. He describes Billy Casper, urchin-like hero of A Kestrel for a Knave by Barry Hines (a late kitchen sink work), as “half-boy, half-pigeon”. Of Morrissey: “The words he uttered were drawn from the end of the rainbow – ‘charming’, ‘elegant’, ‘marvellous’.” There are vivid character sketches of authors Hodkinson has published. Simon Armitage, doing star jumps with his wife on their daughter’s trampoline when he was made poet laureate. Hunter Davies, knocking on, but not so much sprightly as spritely. As they walk through the Lake District chomping on apples, “I half expected him to suggest a game of hide and seek”. There is much dark comedy about Hodkinson’s publishing career. A driver brings a truck load of 3,000 unsold books, to be stored in a lockup. Hodkinson has done his back in, but the driver makes clear he is “under no obligation whatsoever” to help. This is a book about the north; it is also about publishing, writing and music, but it transcends its subjects and meets the criterion Hodkinson sets out in his preface: “The best books, the same as the best days, skitter on the breeze. They go their own way.” Andrew Martin’s latest book, Yorkshire: There and Back, is published in May by Corsair  No One Round Here Reads Tolstoy: Memoirs of a Working-Class Reader by Mark Hodkinson is published by Canongate (£16.99).

1/30/2022,"The setting is unmistakably Japanese: a mountainous backdrop and, out of view but menacingly close, an active volcano. And nestling amid barren rice paddies seeing out the winter, a distillery producing a spirit whose roots lie far from rural Kagoshima. The administrative district on Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu is famed for shochu, a spirit, often made with sweet potatoes or barley, that has sustained family-run businesses here for centuries.  But for the past five years staff at the Komasa Jozo distillery have turned their shochu-making skills to producing gin, as a country better known for the rice-based spirit sake, and its award-winning whiskies, acquires a taste for the juniper berry. Komasa has been distilling shochu since 1883, but branched out into gin production in response to declining demand for the Japanese spirit. “Gin is an international spirit, and shochu consumption is in decline, so that was a factor,” says Makoto Birou, deputy general manager at Komasa, which has been run by the same family for five generations. “It’s distilled, like shochu, which makes it much easier to make. And it’s why Japanese craft gin is of such a high quality. We paid a lot of attention to British gin, but our intention wasn’t to try to copy it but learn how we could make something different.” The use of shochu as the base spirit imparts a subtle Japanese quality to some of the dozens of craft gins to have flooded the domestic market in recent years. But it is the enthusiastic addition of locally sourced botanicals that have surprised, and enchanted, members of the international gin-drinking community – from Japanese citrus fruits to green tea and, in the case of the Sakurao distillery in Hiroshima, oyster shells. Komasa’s three varieties are no exception: Sakurajima Komikan, named after the nearby volcano and made with the world’s smallest tangerine; Hojicha, which incorporates roasted locally grown tea leaves; and its most recent offering, Ichigo, the Japanese word for strawberry. “We wanted to use local ingredients and come up with gins that reflect Japan, and Kagoshima in particular,” says Ryota Miyamae of Komasa’s research and development division. Japan’s craft gin boom began in 2016 when the Kyoto distillery launched Ki No Bi, infused with green tea, bamboo and sansho pepper, among other ingredients, and made with water from a well that has served the area’s sake brewers for centuries. “All that awareness among shochu makers means it’s easy for them to make gin,” says Stephen Lyman, co-host of the Japan Distilled podcast and co-author of The Complete Guide to Japanese Drinks. “They are already experts at fermentation and distilling.” When customers at Miyako Takebe’s bar in Tokyo order a gin and tonic, they are no longer limited to familiar brands from the other side of the world. “It’s so well made,” she says of Ki No Bi, the first Japanese gin she stocked. “People tried it with tonic water and seemed to really enjoy it. Once they had acquired a taste for it, they started asking for other labels. I usually ask them if they’re in the mood for something zesty or floral.” Now her inventory includes several Japanese gins – the Observer sampled, among others, 9148 from the Benizakura distillery in Hokkaido, made with kelp, dried daikon radish and shiitake mushrooms. While old-school gin drinkers tend to draw the line at anything too sweet or citrusy, Takebe says the new breed of enthusiasts is less fussy. “The craft gin boom is for people who didn’t really like the bitterness you get with conventional gin,” she says. “But they’re prepared to try other types that don’t have that prominent, medicinal juniper flavour.” Japan’s connection with gin can be traced to the Edo period (1603-1868), when the spirit was brought over to the Dutch trading post on Dejima island in Nagasaki on Kyushu. Its modern incarnation is influencing the way it’s imbibed, with many drinkers shunning the traditional tonic water and opting instead to water it down as mizuwari or mix it with hot water as oyuwari – a style beloved of many shochu drinkers. Komasa sells its range all over Japan and exports a small quantity overseas. Overall sales in 2021 were double that of the previous year – a reflection of a wider trend that saw exports of Japanese gin reach more than 3,700 kilolitres in the first 10 months of last year, most of it to North America and Europe. Lyman is wary of predictions that Japan’s gins will rival the country’s acclaimed whiskies but believes some hold their own against established labels. “Japanese gin is reminiscent of the early days of craft beer,” he says. “There were microbreweries making all kinds of things, and not all were good. But those that are left make great craft beer. The same thing is happening with gin. I’ve had some unbalanced ones in Japan, but some of them are excellent.”",Lifestyle/Food,Gin twist: Japan reinvents the spirit with the help of green tea and oysters ,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/30/gin-twist-japan-reinvents-the-spirit-with-the-help-of-green-tea-and-oysters
1/30/2022,"Campaigners are urging ministers to ensure any forthcoming UK-wide ban on conversion practices does not contain a loophole allowing those who received “informed consent” from their victims to evade justice. Critics of the practice declared “you cannot consent to abuse”, as a survey revealed the extent of sexual violence used during attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  Research indicates about 7% of LGBT+ people have been offered or undergone conversion practices, and activists are concerned that UK proposals do not go far enough, with the consent loophole causing the most consternation. A Holyrood committee last week published a report calling for an immediate ban on the “traumatising” practice in Scotland, with the recommendations being welcomed as a fully comprehensive prohibition, with no exemptions. The consultation on Whitehall proposals is closing on Friday, with supporters rallying to ensure the UK government’s measures on the “abhorrent practice” are equally watertight. The novelist Jeanette Winterson told the Guardian: “Any country with equal rights should be banning conversion therapy. To me, it’s as bad as forced marriage.” The LGBT+ anti-abuse charity Galop released a survey last week that revealed that about one in four LGBT+ victims of sexual violence in the UK had been assaulted by people they believed were trying to “convert or punish” them for their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Galop CEO, Leni Morris, said: “Our survey shows very starkly that the reality of conversion therapy in the UK is far from what people imagine, or have seen in films like The Miseducation of Cameron Post, where American high school kids get sent to a Christian camp.” Addressing the proposed consent loophole, Morris said: “It is fundamental that UK legislation does not carve out a form of abuse that is OK if you agree to it – consider domestic abuse, forced marriage, honour-based violence – you cannot consent to abuse.” Galop runs a helpline for people who have experienced conversion practices. “We hear from a large proportion of people who believe they consented to what happened to them,” Morris said. “I would argue you can’t consent to something that if you do not go through with it, you risk losing your religious connections, your community, your family or your home”. Sasha Misra of Stonewall said comprehensive legislation was required to outlaw “all forms of conversion therapies in every setting without loopholes … It’s been over three years since the UK government committed to banning conversion therapy, it must act now to protect our communities and outlaw this abhorrent practice once and for all”. The UK government has explicitly pledged to include trans people in their legislation, despite a recent response from the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggesting that the legislation should initially focus on attempts to change sexual orientation only. In Scotland, some faith groups expressed anxieties that prayer and pastoral conversations would be affected by the new law. Holyrood’s Equalities Committee rejected this, however, stating it saw no conflict between banning conversion practices and protecting religious practice. Blair Anderson, of End Conversion Therapy Scotland, himself a survivor of the practice, said the public were often shocked at its prevalence. “The public don’t know that this is happening all around them, in family homes or in churches,” he said. “My experience was informal and at home: that’s why we need a broad definition of what conversion therapy is.” He added: “As a teenager, my mother would take me through prayer, asking God to stop me being gay, and reading passages from the Bible telling me I would go to Hell. She isolated me from support and told me that family members would die as a punishment if I didn’t change.” Winterson has previously written about being subjected to exorcisms as an LGBT+ teenager by the Pentecostal church. She said: “My view is that if a person isn’t comfortable with their sexual orientation, they should be able to find a therapist to talk through their feelings. There are plenty of uncomfortable heterosexuals, and of course there are people who for religious reasons, and sometimes for family reasons, find their gayness impossible to manage. “Therapy is great; conversion therapy is silly. The talking cure isn’t there to talk you out of your feelings; it’s there to help you be you, whatever that means.”",News/World news,Activists warn against loophole in UK ban on conversion practices,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/activists-warn-against-loophole-in-uk-ban-on-conversion-practices
1/30/2022,"Record vacancies, as firms complain they can’t find staff. Employers taking that most extreme of measures: raising wages. This is not the usual post-recession story, partly reflecting that the pandemic has shrunk our labour force by around half a million workers. This has led to speculation about the lasting effects of pandemic-induced labour shortages, with suggestions ranging from higher prices, to more machines replacing missing workers, or a smaller economy. But in terms of what comes next, it’s possible that less crystal ball gazing and a few more history lessons might help.  That’s where new research into the impact of cholera outbreaks in 19th-century France that killed 1% of the population comes in. It looks at the number of deaths in different areas to investigate how the labour scarcity they caused affected the adoption of technology. It turns out that bigger shortages had a positive effect on uptake of technology (ploughs) and innovation (irrigation) in agriculture, but a temporary negative impact on industry (mining/textiles). Why? Because technology substitutes workers in agriculture, so can replace them, but complements them in industry. Labour shortages increased people’s confidence that learning how to read would pay off via higher wages, boosting the need for agricultural mechanisation because literate workers avoided low-paid jobs there. So, some good news for those hoping labour shortages will boost investment. The bad news? It involved training, which we’re not much interested in these days. Importantly, today’s workforce reduction is about older workers and young men not seeking work, compared with cholera deaths in 19th-century France. So we shouldn’t just ponder the effect of labour shortages – we should reduce them by supporting people back to work.  Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

1/30/2022,"From now on I’ll find it hard to wash my hands without thinking of Mark Rylance. In Dr Semmelweis he incarnates the Hungarian doctor who was a pioneer of antisepsis but is now largely forgotten. Perplexed, furious and zealous, Rylance is the burning centre of the play he wrote with Stephen Brown before the pandemic, and which is now brought to reverberating life under the direction of Tom Morris. Working in the obstetric clinic of the Vienna general hospital in the mid-19th century, Ignaz Semmelweis was appalled by the number of women who were dying soon after giving birth. Conventional medicine considered the deaths inevitable, accounting for them by miasma, poor ventilation or emotional disturbance. Semmelweis’s investigations, conducted before the concept of bacteria, revealed that patients were being unintentionally harmed by the men who were trying to heal them: physicians, who moved straight from conducting autopsies to delivering babies, were contaminating the mothers. When they washed their hands with a chlorinated solution, the deaths ceased. The effect was indisputable but resisted by the medical profession for years; Semmelweis died, his work unacknowledged, in an asylum.  The medical history is crystal clear, but this is also a murky individual story. In the way of whistleblowers, Semmelweis was tremendously difficult. Not simply awkward but ruthless, blinkered, dragged by vision and mission. Rylance is wonderful at conveying the sense of being out of control, unstable with passion. His eyes are often fixed, but his words come out in flurries; he seems to interrupt himself, as if head-butted by his own sentences. The human cost of his obsession, in which individuals are sacrificed for the general good, is made painfully apparent in very fine performances by Thalissa Teixeira as his wounded, distinguished wife, and Jackie Clune, the intelligent nurse to whom no one attends because she is – well – just a nurse. Morris directs with high imagination, weaving together naturalism and dream. Ti Green’s design encloses the action in an iron rotunda: unyielding, inescapable (though Rylance twice shins up its tall pillars). Voiceless women, dead mothers, soft-limbed in russet and pirouetting in tulle, dance through the evening. Violinists (all female) move among the audience and actors, playing Schubert’s Death and the Maiden. These are more than spectral victims. They are reminders that the line between delusion and original insight is not firm; that not everybody sees everything; that phenomena as yet unnamed and unexplained – hello, 19th-century bacteria – are not necessarily fictions. Elizabeth McGovern has also written a play with herself in the title role. Ava: The Secret Conversations is the story of a star, but as drama it is more of a black hole. Based on Ava Gardner’s autobiography, written with Peter Evans, Gaby Dellal’s production trots dutifully through the actor’s life, viewed from the perspective of her final years, when, having had a stroke and settled in London, she was being interviewed by Evans, played by Anatol Yusef. Videos designed by Matthew Taylor – rather too sumptuous for a play that aims at intimacy – act like tourist-board ads when the scene shifts: London is St Paul’s and a downpour of rain, though Gardner actually lived on the other side of town. The two actors often remind each other of who they are: “Peter, can I ask you a question?” “Yes, Ava.” The fairly well-rehearsed facts of Gardner’s life – with husbands Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra – enable McGovern to be barefoot and foul-mouthed, but also kittenish, and Yusef to supply some routine gestures towards impersonation (Sinatra is slurred in a trilby). The off-stage voice of Ed Victor, wheeler-dealer literary agent, is heard demanding his client get details of Sinatra’s penis: not fair to Victor, this – he certainly wasn’t delicate, but he was too clever to be that crass. McGovern flickeringly suggests how beguilingly she might summon up Gardner, but she is very low-wattage. Why? Because of the stroke (one hand is crooked to her chest)? Because her spirits are waning with her fame? Or because she is stunned by the script she has given herself? She deserves better.

1/30/2022,"Before the pandemic, Deborah Yewande Bankole was on what she describes as a “steady diet of short stories”. She loved seeking out emerging writers and admired the work of Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, Julia Armfield and Danielle Evans, but had not considered writing one of her own. So during lockdown, when furloughed from her job as a creative producer, she found herself with the time to sit down and write, and was surprised when what materialised was her own first short story.  Less than two years on, she has completed a six-month writing course at independent publisher Dahlia Books, been awarded a mentorship by Word Factory, the national short story organisation, with author Toby Litt and hopes to publish a short story soon. “Short story writing allows you to do things in literature in a variety of different ways that perhaps long-form writing doesn’t,” she said. The 31-year-old from London was one of many to try their hand at writing short stories during lockdown as the art form enjoys rising popularity. The Dublin-based literary magazine The Stinging Fly, whose previous editors have included author Sally Rooney, said submissions have increased by 100% in the last two to three years, while subscriptions went up by 50% during the pandemic (although it lost out on physical sales to closed bookshops). Such is the apparent appetite for short stories that a new independent press entirely dedicated to them – believed to be the first of its kind in the UK – is to launch in March. Scratch Books’ first publication will be Reverse Engineering, a collection of seven short stories by authors including Irenosen Okojie, Sarah Hall and Mahreen Sohail. Founder Tom Conaghan said today’s “weird fragmented times” are ripe for short stories: “There’s an appetite for it. Life is coming undone and the short story has that potential to reflect it more than anything.” Meanwhile, he said that a new generation of short story writers comparable to greats such as Alice Munro, who announced her retirement in 2013 shortly before winning the Nobel prize in literature, and the late Flannery O’Connor is coming through. Among the key figures, he names Okojie, Ben Pester, Wendy Erskine and Nicholas Royle. Through Scratch he wants to democratise the short story, which, he admits, “has maybe made itself slightly exclusive”. He hopes to one day make short stories so accessible that they are readily available in supermarkets. Royle, who as well as writing short stories and novels edits the annual Best British Short Stories and runs Nightjar Press, said short stories are finally getting the profile they have “deserved for a long time”. Between 1890 and the first world war there were dozens of magazines and newspapers publishing short fiction in Britain, but now there are very few. Royle wants to see more magazines supporting short stories in the way that publications such as the New Yorker, which regularly publishes short fiction, still do in the US. “We just don’t do that [in the UK]. We have magazines that could do that and don’t, so it’s been disappointing.” Some have put the rise in popularity down to reduced attention spans, but Royle disagrees. He said: “A good short story requires you to concentrate and it’s the most amazing example of the story coming together between writer and reader. There’s this great intimacy.” He said independent publishers such as Salt Publishing, Comma Press and Nightjar Press, and prizes such as the Sunday Times short story award, the BBC national short story award, the Manchester fiction prize and the Edge Hill short story prize, the winner of which was due to be announced on Saturday night, have played a key role. Declan Meade, editor and publisher of The Stinging Fly, said momentum has been building for some time. “Writers are feeding off the energy that’s there for them in the short story and recognising the potential of it and you can see that in the variety of the form itself.” Ireland’s story writing scene, he said, has been helped by increased funding from the country’s Arts Council during the pandemic, with new literary magazines launching all the time. When The Stinging Fly launched its own press in 2005, it was a struggle for writers to get their first book of stories published. But now, one of the most positive signs, Meade said, is that short story collections are increasingly being published by big players such as Bloomsbury and Picador. But, he adds, there is still a “pecking order”, with authors usually expected to promise to produce a novel soon after. During lockdown, the magazine had to bring in extra readers to get through all the submissions as people with long-harboured writing aspirations found the time to do it. “I don’t know whether the pandemic will swing it in favour of the short story once and for all… but it would be nice to see it happen,” he says. Cathy Galvin, journalist, poet and founder of Word Factory and the Sunday Times short story award, said the form’s current health has been about 15 years in the making: “There’s a very vibrant, diverse, powerful series of voices that are coming through in the short story form and being heard and making a difference, and that’s why the short story form is alive, because the writing is alive and the writing is rooted in real experience.” Unlike some sectors of the book industry, print sales of short stories have remained steady through the pandemic in the UK, according to Nielsen BookData, with sales for 2021 from mid-March to the end of the year of £4.1m (the top seller was First Person Singular by Haruki Murakami followed by Jo Nesbø’s The Jealousy Man). But it does not include short stories accessed via online platforms, which have played a significant role for readers and writers across the world globally. Chimeka Garricks, the Lagos-based author of short story collection A Broken People’s Playlist, said online journals are a vital part of the short story ecosystem – for helping writers to gauge interest and gain a following and for greater accessibility to readers: “They give the writers a platform to publish their work, even if it’s a work in progress.” What are the short story’s prospects, then? Paul Baggaley, editor-in-chief for adult consumer publishing at Bloomsbury, said publishers in the UK are increasingly seeing new formats and genres such as autobiographical fiction and essay collections as commercially viable, which they would not have done previously, and this, he said, bodes well for short stories. While in the past a publisher might have “gently tried to persuade an author away from writing stories”, now, he said, “that’s a thing of the past.” Giving as examples Alan Moore, author of the Watchmen comic book series, and Three Women author Lisa Taddeo, both of whom have short story collections coming out, he said: “Once you have that position and that reputation and that fanbase, then they will follow you for everything.”",Arts/Books,Tales of the unexpected: the surprise boom in UK short stories ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/tales-of-the-unexpected-the-surprise-boom-in-uk-short-stories
