3/23/2022,"A river basin to the northwest of Kyiv has been flooded. It's unclear whether this was intentional, but it could be a move to block Russian troops. If the troops were unable to cross the river, they wouldn't be able to capture Kyiv from the West, per CNN. Satellite images show flooding in the Irpin River basin northwest of Kyiv. It is unclear what caused the flooding, but this could be a strategic move by Ukraine to block the advance of Russian troops on the capital, analysts have said. The basin borders a large reservoir. It could be an example of ""hydraulic warfare"" from Ukraine to block the advancing Russian troops targeting the city's northwest, analysts previously told the Washington Post. If the Russian forces cannot cross the Irpin river, they will not be able to take Kyiv from the west, according to CNN. According to the UK's defense intelligence, Russian troops have driven towards Kyiv from the north, west, and east since the war began on February 24. Capturing Kyiv is seen as Russia's primary goal in its invasion of Ukraine, but it has struggled to make headway facing fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. Ukraine said Tuesday that it had recaptured Makariv, a town west of Kyiv, the Associated Press said, further blunting Russia's ambition to launch an assault on the city from the northwest. Ukraine's ambassador to the US said on February 26 that Russian forces had destroyed a dam in the water reservoir North of Kyiv. However, it is unclear whether that event is connected to the flooding, per The Washington Post.

3/23/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia on Wednesday condemned what it called a ""reckless"" Polish proposal to send international peacekeepers into Ukraine and warned that it could lead to a direct clash between Russian and NATO forces. Poland said last Friday it would formally submit a proposal for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at the next NATO summit. Asked about the initiative, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""It would be a very reckless and extremely dangerous decision."" He told reporters on a conference call that any possible contact between Russian and NATO forces ""could have clear consequences that would be hard to repair"". Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. Speaking in Kyiv last week, Poland's ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said: ""I think that it is necessary to have a peace mission - NATO, possibly some wider international structure - but a mission that will be able to defend itself, which will operate on Ukrainian territory."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also attacked the proposal in remarks to staff and students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Wednesday. ""This will be the direct clash between the Russian and NATO armed forces that everyone has not only tried to avoid but said should not take place in principle,"" he said.
