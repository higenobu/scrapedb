12/14/2021,"Rags to riches is a common trope in our storytelling. Some people actually live it, and few more so than hedge fund billionaire Israel Englander. Using $35 million in seed money, Englander started Millennium Management – and by 2019 his firm was managing over $39 billion. As of this year, that number is up to $57 billion. In 2020, Millennium brought in a total of $10.2 billion for its investors, and Englander took home $3.8 billion in personal earnings – which made him the highest paid fund manager on Wall Street. So, investors seeking strong returns can do a lot worse than to follow Englander’s stock buys. We’ve done just that, using the TipRanks platform to pull up details on three stocks in which Englander staked out new positions. The platform revealed that each has earned a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus and boasts significant upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Nuvation Bio (NUVB) We'll start with Nuvation, a clinical-stage biopharma company involved in oncological research. Nuvation is investigating ‘differentiated and novel’ therapeutic agents, testing their potential to meet unmet needs in cancer treatment. The company’s pipeline, which features new drug candidates for the treatment of a wide range of cancers is mostly in the preclinical stages - but there is one Phase 1 study with enrollment ongoing. That study focuses on drug candidate NUV-422, a CDK 2/4/6 inhibitor, as a treatment for high grade gliomas, a form of brain cancer. Preclinical testing showed that the drug crossed the blood-brain barrier, and limits various causes of toxicity. The Phase 1/2 study was started in December of last year, and continues to enroll patients. The company expects to release data from the Phase 1 portion of the study next year. In addition to this study, the company has recently announced FDA clearance for two new Investigational New Drug Applications for NUV-22, in the treatment of prostate cancer and advanced breast cancer. Nuvation has several more INDAs planned for submission by 2026, in the treatment of various solid tumors and hematologic cancers. Englander was impressed enough with Nuvation's situation to buy in, staking a new position of 373,471 shares. These are currently worth $3.52 million. The hedge billionaire isn’t Nuvation’s only fan. RBC analyst Kennen MacKay lays out a clear case for optimism in this company: “We continue to like NUVB at these early stages as they progress towards de-risking events… The expansion cohorts continue enrollment with the expectation of the first Ph1 data readout in 2022. In the Q3 report, the company reiterated their previous timeline for trial enrollment and data readout, providing confidence in the ability for the company to execute during these early stages of development. We believe this positions the company well with multiple 'shots-on-goal' with their lead asset.” To this end, MacKay rates NUVB an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $15 price target implies an upside of 59% for the coming year. (To watch MacKay’s track record, click here) The RBC view is far from the only positive analyst report on Nuvation; the company has received unanimously positive reviews in recent weeks for a Strong Buy consensus. NUVB shares are trading for $9.13, and their average price target of $16 suggests room for a 69% upside from that level. (See NUVB stock forecast on TipRanks) Thorne HealthTech (THRN) For the next stock, we’ll stay in the healthcare segment – but take a very different look at it. Thorne is a leader in the health tech industry, offering customers – individuals, healthcare professionals, corporations, and health care plan providers – a science-driven, personalized approach to keeping up health and well-being. Customers can get actionable insights based on personalized data, insights that inform their choice of products and services to improve and maintain health outcomes. This is a new stock in the public markets. Thorne held its IPO in September of this year. The company put 7 million shares on the market at $10 each, meeting the initial pricing and raising $70 million gross capital. In its first financial report as a public company, for 3Q21, released in November, Thorne showed several positive metric. Gross margins came in at over 53%, a near-record for the company, and revenue, at $48 million, beat the forecast by 6%. It’s clear that Englander liked what he saw in Thorne – his firm bought 492,928 shares in the company. At the current valuation, this is worth $3.39 million. In coverage of Thorne for RBC, analyst Sean Dodge writes: “While the supplements space is fragmented, Thorne has established itself as a premium brand with an impressive list of partners. Moreover, we believe the company has underinvested in sales and marketing, leaving a substantial opportunity to capture share in a large, growing market with a heightened focus on preventative health. Further, its Onegevity data and analytics platform provides additional B2B growth opportunities, in our view enough to sustain 30%+ revenue growth for several years. While EBITDA will likely see some compression as the company ramps marketing spend, adjusted EBITDA margins should remain positive and resume an upward trajectory toward the company’s 18–20% long-term target."" In line with these comments, Dodge gives the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a price target of $11, suggesting it has room for 65% upside by the end of next year. (To watch Dodge’s track record, click here) Overall, Thorne has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 positive reviews. The stock is trading for $6.61 and its average price target of $11.50 indicates a potential 74% upside from that level. (See THRN stock forecast on TipRanks) Hyzon Motors (HYZN) Last on our list, Hyzon Motors, is a ‘green’ automaker, an appellation that can apply to both the company and the product. Hyzon is developing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, an alternative to battery-powered electric cars. Hydrogen fuel cell tech has potential to power passenger and commercial vehicles, while emitting only water as a by-product. Hyzon’s focus is commercial vehicles and trucks. The company has a facility in Rochester, New York, that produces 150kW fuel cells, and is gearing up to produce 370kW systems. These will generate the equivalent of 500 horsepower, and will be suitable for a range of heavy-duty commercial applications, including mining vehicles, marine vessels, and inter-city rail locomotives. Hyzon in recent weeks has been pursuing moves into the Chinese commercial vehicle market. The company on December 8 announced that it had delivered 29 fuel cell electric trucks, 49 ton models, to a major steel conglomerate in that country. The delivery was facilitated by the Shanghai Hydrogen HongYun Automotive Company. The trucks use 170kW power cells and are expected to eliminate up to 140 tons of CO2 during their lifetimes. That deliver followed another trial delivery, of eight dump trucks to the Foshan Municipality. The delivery to Foshan is part of a trial, to see if fuel cell tech can replace diesel fuel. Because it has not yet begun regular production, but is instead still delivering small orders for trial use, Hyzon has a revenue stream of only $968,000. The company reported a solid balance sheet in the most recent quarter, 3Q21, with $498 million in liquid assets available. Izzy Englander is clearly not worried by Hyzon’s speculative nature, and bought 1,356,081 shares in the firm. This stake is worth $9.11 million at current prices. Analyst Richard Ryan, from Colliers Securities, is another fan of this stock, writing, “The company has seen supply chain headwinds during 3Q21, but will likely find success in mitigating future disruption because of a pivot into the Chinese market over the European market. The foray into China will likely prove to be critical to HYZN's ability to receive necessary parts for production and maintain their guided delivery count.” These comments back up a Buy rating on the stock, and Ryan’s $15 price target implies a 120% upside ahead. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here) All in all, Hyzon’s analyst reviews break down 3 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, and the $13 average price target suggests a potential for ~91% upside from the trading price of $6.78.

12/14/2021,"Investors this week are set to focus on the Federal Reserve's final monetary policy decision of 2021, which may include more signaling of a monetary policy adjustment amid elevated inflation and a strengthening economic backdrop.  Members of the Federal Open Market Committee are set to hold their two-day policy-setting meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, after which they will release their monetary policy statement and hold a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The December statement will also be accompanied by an updated Summary of Economic Projections — the first since September — outlining members' expectations for economic conditions and interest rates over the next few years. Many economists now expect that this month's meeting will serve as the platform for Fed officials to increase the rate of tapering of their asset-purchase program. For more than a year-and-a-half during the pandemic, the Fed bought Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a clip of $120 billion per month, with this program comprising a key tool in supporting the virus-stricken economy. Last month, the Fed began winding down this program, slowing its purchases by $15 billion per month in each of November and December as the economy showed signs that it could continue to recover from the pandemic without the added monetary policy support.  ""We expect the Fed to announce a doubling in the pace of tapering at the December FOMC meeting, bringing the monthly drawdown to $20 billion and $10 billion per month for Treasuries and MBS, respectively. This would conclude the tapering process in March and open up greater optionality for an earlier liftoff,"" wrote Deutsche Bank economists led by Matthew Luzzetti in a note late last week.  Heading into next week's meeting, Fed officials have already struck a more hawkish tone and suggested a near-term acceleration to tapering could be coming. Powell told Congress late last month that the central bank would discuss at the December meeting ""whether it would be appropriate to wrap up our purchases a few months early,"" given the backdrop of ""an economy that is very strong and inflationary pressures that are very high."" Other officials have echoed these sentiments. And in the weeks since Powell delivered those remarks, inflationary pressures have only come in hotter. The November Consumer Price Index showed a 6.8% year-over-year rise in consumer prices last month — the fastest since 1982. And other data have underscored the tightness of the present labor market, suggesting employers might need to further raise wages — and in doing so contribute further to inflationary pressures — in order to compete for talent. Weekly jobless claims came in at the lowest since 1969 last week, while job openings came in above 11 million in the U.S. for only the second time ever recorded in October.  ""Strong economic growth, labor market recovery and elevated inflation has clearly moved the Fed toward an accelerated focus on shifting policy and particularly in getting quantitative easing over with,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income and head of the BlackRock Global Allocation Investment Team, wrote in an email Friday. ""That said, the Fed will also have to balance these factors alongside potential Omicron risks, its supply and demand influences, potentially moderately slowing demand for goods and services and the possibility of rising geopolitical risks."" Still, other pundits pointed out that the Fed will need to be cautious about not coming off so hawkish at their next meeting that it spooks the markets, which have already been on edge about risks around inflation.  ""The Fed wants to jawbone this inflation a little bit lower here over the coming months,"" Christopher Vecchio, DailyFX.com senior strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""They also are cognizant of the fact that raising interest rates will not unclog the ports, it will not lead to any fixed capital investment increase to fix the infrastructure problems, if you will, that have been creating these supply chain problems. And so this is a tight walk here."" ""They really have to be careful about potentially tipping markets over by appearing too hawkish at the onset,"" he added. ""So I do think we're going to see strong forecasts on inflation, strong forecasts for growth. But ultimately, by the end of 2022, particularly 2023, those forecasts for inflation should be getting closer to the trend."" One key piece of economic data out this week will be November retail sales, offering a look at the strength of the consumer in the midst of the holiday shopping season.  Consensus economists are expecting to see retail sales rise by 0.8% in November compared to October, according to Bloomberg data. This would slow compared to October's 1.7% monthly increase, but still represent a fourth straight monthly increase.  ""The gain should be supported by holiday sales with clothing showing the biggest sequential gain among major sectors,"" Bank of America economist Michelle Meyer estimated in a note on Friday. ""That said, we do think the risks are skewed to the downside given the sizable upside surprise in October's sales.""  The bigger-than-expected rise in retail sales in October stemmed from strength in a variety of categories. Non-store retailers, or e-commerce platforms, posted a 4% sales increase, while gasoline station sales and electronics and appliance stores saw sales grow 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Some economists suggested the monthly jump likely stemmed from consumers doing their holiday shopping earlier this year to try and get ahead of supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.  Other private data on consumption for November came in strong, further suggesting another solid monthly rise in retail sales. Adobe Analytics said in an update published Nov. 30 that consumers had already spent $109.8 billion online between Nov. 1 to Nov. 29, with this figure growing 11.9%, compared to last year.  Monday: No notable reports scheduled for release Tuesday: NFIB Small Business Optimism, November (98.4 expected, 98.2 in October); Producer Price Index (PPI), month-over-month, November (0.5% expected, 0.6% in October); PPI excluding food and energy, month-over-month, November (0.4% expected, 0.4% in October); PPI year-over-year, November (9.2% expected, 8.6% in October); PPI excluding food and energy, year-over-year, November (6.8% expected, 6.8% in October) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Dec. 10 (2.0% during prior week); Retail sales excluding autos and gas, month-over-month, November (0.8% expected, 1.4% in October); Import price index, month-over-month, November (0.8% expected, 1.2% in October); Business Inventories, October (1.0% expected, 0.7% in September); NAHB Housing Market Index, December (84 expected, 83 in November); FOMC Rate Decision Thursday: Initial jobless claims, week ended Dec. 11 (199,000 expected, 184,000 during prior week); Continuing claims, week ended Dec. 4 (1.992 million during prior week); Housing starts, month-over-month, November (3.3% expected, -0.7% in October); Building permits, month-over-month, November (0.4% expected, 4.2% in October); Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook Index, December (30.0 expected, 39.0 in November); Industrial Production, month-over-month, November (0.7% expected, 1.6% in October); Capacity Utilization, November (76.8% expected, 76.4% in October); Manufacturing Production, November (0.7% expected, 1.2% in October); Markit U.S. Manufacturing PMI, December preliminary (58.5 expected, 58.3 in November); Markit U.S. Composite PMI, December preliminary (57.2 in November); Markit U.S. Services PMI, December preliminary (58.0 in November); Kansas City Federal Reserve Manufacturing Activity, December (24 in November) Friday: No notable reports scheduled for release Monday: No notable reports scheduled for release Tuesday: No notable reports scheduled for release Wednesday: Lennar (LEN) after market close Thursday: Adobe (ADBE) before market open; FedEx (FDX), Rivian (RIVN) after market close Friday: Darden Restaurants (DRI) before market open — Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

12/14/2021,"Among American corporations, the rental car company Hertz has it all. Atrocious customer service? Check. Grasping executives? Check. Billions diverted to shareholders while thousands of employees get laid off? Check. Misleadingly optimistic public statements? Check. Accounting scandal? Check. That's quite a record for a company that was once held up as the quintessential customer-oriented service brand. It has earned Hertz what corporate bigwigs no doubt consider a badge of honor: a rocket from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). [Hertz] is happy to reward executives, company insiders, and big shareholders while stiffing consumers with record high rental car costs. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. In a blistering letter dated Dec. 6, Warren asked the company to explain its recent decision to spend up to $2 billion buying back its own stock, given that it only emerged from bankruptcy in June. Presumably Hertz needs all the capital it can muster to rebuild its business and reputation from the depths of the pandemic, which brought it close to death. Instead, Warren observed, much of that $2-billion gift will flow to the private equity firm Apollo Global Management, a member of the investment clique that bought the company out of bankruptcy. Most of the money will be used to repurchase preferred stock that Apollo and other private investors acquired in return for financing Hertz's exit from bankruptcy, but they'll receive a handsome profit — about a 70% annualized rate of return on what was effectively a five-month investment. The preferred shares will be repurchased at a 25% premium — the holders will receive about $1,250 each for shares that were issued at $1,000. This decision and others, Warren remarked, ""reveals that the company is happy to reward executives, company insiders, and big shareholders while stiffing consumers with record high rental car costs and ignoring the recent history that nearly wiped out the company."" No one should be surprised at Warren's questions about the share buyback. These transactions have long been a target of business economists and corporate critics in Congress, who assert that they divert corporate resources that should go instead to investing in the business and its workforce. Indeed, President Biden's Build Back Better framework has included a 1% surcharge on buybacks, though it's unclear whether the tax will be enacted. Buybacks ""make no contribution to the productive capabilities of the firm,"" economist William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts and colleagues observed last year in the Harvard Business Review. He and his coauthors were especially critical of debt-financed buybacks such as Hertz's. Those cases, they wrote, are ""bad management, given that no revenue-generating investments are made that can allow the company to pay off the debt."" Hertz said in announcing the deal that the ""repurchase program allows for ongoing and profitable investment in the business."" A spokesperson told me the company will respond to Warren's questions by the deadline she set, Dec. 17. Warren also referred in her letter to how Hertz executives made out great on either side of the bankruptcy. Three days before its bankruptcy filing, the company said it agreed to pay retention bonuses totaling $16.2 million to executives. Among the handouts were $700,000 to Chief Executive Paul Stone, who had been appointed to the post a few weeks earlier; $600,000 to Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson; and $189,633 to Chief Marketing Officer Jodi Allen. The timing was exquisite — by reaching the agreements before filing its bankruptcy petition, the company didn't need a bankruptcy judge's permission. In August, after exiting bankruptcy, Hertz paid out another tranche of retention bonuses. Stone got $1.4 million and three other top executives received a total of $1.765 million. Less than two months later, Stone stepped down as CEO, though he stayed on as chief operating officer. His successor, Mark Fields, is to receive an annual salary of $3.25 million plus a grant of 500,000 shares of stock. So that takes care of inside shareholders and executives. What about consumers? They haven't made out so well. Median rental charges at Hertz were running 147% above pre-pandemic rates in August, by the reckoning of Hamzah Mazari, an analyst at Jefferies. Rates have risen throughout the rental-car industry, Mazari noted, partially because of surging demand and the difficulty of adding cars to company fleets. But Hertz's increases surpassed those of competitors Avis (50%) or Enterprise (57%). Some of the horrors that Hertz has visited upon its customers through filthy cars and unwarranted fees have been chronicled by my colleague David Lazarus. The trophy for Hertz-borne mistreatment, as well as one for outstanding consumer pushback, probably belongs to Kate Klonick, a New York law professor who suffered the tortures of the damned when trying to collect a reserved car from Hertz in Brooklyn on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. As Klonick wrote in the short version of her painfully detailed Twitter thread: ""Hertz refused to honor our contract, we had to call 20+ times, were hung up on 6 times, were 2 different locations that couldn't help us on our own dime, tried to make us pay $1800 for a new rental 4 times, and ended up making us pay $500+ over quoted price for a bad car."" Fortunately for Klonick, her tweets went viral and became featured in a raft of news articles, some on the theme of how Hertz had picked the wrong customer to abuse. Eventually, a Hertz representative reached out to her and agreed to refund what she says was the ultimate overcharge of $548.07 for the car she eventually got, but not the $133.51 in Uber charges she incurred traveling from location to location to pick up a car on Hertz employees' instructions. What brought Hertz, which used to dominate the car-rental market (remember when Avis built its advertising campaign around the boast that it was ""No. 2,"" but ""We Try Harder""?) to this wretched pass? It's certainly true that the collapse of demand during the pandemic had much to do with the company's decline. In March 2020 it began laying off or furloughing 20,000 employees, half its payroll. During its bankruptcy Hertz sold almost 200,000 cars, ""reducing the fleet size by nearly one-third,"" Warren observed. But the disaster was seeded long before the pandemic — as long ago as 2012, when it bested Avis in a battle for the Dollar and Thrifty rental chain by paying $2.3 billion, which was seen even at the time as a massive overbid. Strategic missteps compounded the trouble, including a focus on sedans and compact cars when renters preferred SUVs. By 2017, Hertz was in the red, its shares notching double-digit percentage drops day by day. Its market capitalization fell from $5.5 billion before the acquisition to $1 billion by May 2017 and its debt soared, reaching $17 billion just before the bankruptcy filing. Hertz lost a total of $273 million in 2018 and 2019, and $1.86 billion in 2020. Hertz also had to restate its earnings from February 2012 through March 2014 to correct what the Securities and Exchange Commission said were material misstatements, and paid a $16-million penalty in 2019 to settle the SEC complaint. Bizarrely, once in bankruptcy Hertz became a meme stock, favored by denizens of internet message boards despite its unprepossessing condition. Buyers started snapping up shares, disregarding the conventional wisdom that shareholders almost always get wiped out in a bankruptcy. Hertz tried to exploit the investor interest by launching a share offering while it was in bankruptcy. Hertz specifically warned would-be buyers that they were unlikely to end up with anything after the bankruptcy ran its course, which normally satisfies SEC standards favoring full disclosure of risks, the SEC effectively shut down the offering. This turned out to be a case in which the plungers read the fine print more closely than the experts. Hertz had noted that a recovery for shareholders ""would require a significant and rapid and currently unanticipated improvement in business conditions to pre-COVID-19 or close to pre-COVID-19 levels,"" and that's largely what has happened. Hertz has shown a $627-million profit on $5.4 billion in revenue for the first nine months of this year, which ended Sept. 30. Yet one wonders if the company is still a decent bet. In many ways it's still a ""story stock"" — one that appeals to investors more through conjecture about the future than a sober analysis of the past, especially the recent past. Customer service problems are common enough to fill a Facebook page titled ""Hertz Rent-a-Car Sucks"" with stories about defective cars and miscellaneous unwarranted fees. Hertz experienced a wave of free positive publicity in October when it said it had placed an order for 100,000 electric cars with Tesla for delivery by the end of next year. That made it sound as if the company had placed itself in the vanguard of transport innovation, except that the delivery schedule appears to be ambitious, to say the least. Tesla boss Elon Musk tweeted shortly after Hertz's announcement that no contract had been signed at that point, and Tesla has made clear that Hertz will have to stand in line like any other buyers to receive its cars, which makes it unlikely that it can place 100,000 Teslas on the road by the end of 2022. Nor will Hertz get a volume discount, as other carmakers have customarily awarded fleet buyers such as rental companies. So there we are. Hertz may prove to be a harbinger of the post-pandemic recovery, or it could be hobbled again by a slowdown caused by the Omicron variant of the virus causing COVID-19. It could shed its decade-long aura of mismanagement, or it may not. Recent events, as Warren suggests, are less than auspicious. ""You owe your customers and the public an explanation for this $2 billion buyback, and whether it is in the best interests of the long-term health of the company and its consumers,"" Warren wrote. She asked the company to respond to her questions about the buyback by next Friday, and thus far hasn't heard back.

Shiba Inu Coin rose by 2.93% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 3.40% fall from Friday, Shiba Inu Coin ended the day at $0.00003445. A mixed start to the day saw Shiba Inu Coin fall to an early morning intraday low $0.00003312 before making a move. Steering clear of the first major support level at $0.0000325, Shiba Inu Coin rose to a mid-morning intraday high $0.00003503. Coming within range of the first major resistance level at $0.0000353, Shiba Inu Coin fell back to $0.0000335 levels before finding late support to wrap up the day at $0.0000344 levels. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu Coin was up by 0.29% to $0.00003455. A mixed start to the day saw Shiba Inu Coin fall to an early morning low $0.00003443 before rising to a high $0.00003473. Shiba Inu Coin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Shiba Inu Coin would need to avoid the $0.0000342 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $0.0000353 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, would be needed for a break back through to $0.000035 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $0.00003503 would likely cap the upside In the event of an extended breakout, Shiba Inu Coin could test resistance at the 62% FIB of $0.000037. The second major resistance level sits at $0.0000361. A fall through the $0.0000342 pivot would bring the first major support level at $0.0000334 into play. Barring another extended sell-off, however, Shiba Inu Coin should avoid the second major support level at $0.0000323. For the bears, a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $0.000037 would form a near-term bearish trend.

12/14/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group will cancel $2.3 billion in debt owed by Mongolia as the miner seeks to push forward with expanding the giant Oyu Tolgoi copper project that’s been beset by years of disputes, delays and cost blowouts. Most Read from Bloomberg Zero Taxes, Golf and Beach Houses Create a Crypto Island Paradise China Is Building the World’s Largest National Park System Boris Johnson’s Furious MPs Worry That His Next Misstep Could Be Fatal The 15 Best Beers We Drank This Year Former Oil Trader Is Now Betting on Lumber for Skyscrapers Rio’s Chief Executive Officer Jakob Stausholm proposed improved terms for a 2015 financing agreement that underpins the mine’s underground expansion, according to a Dec. 13 letter to Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai posted on Mongolia’s government website. Writing off the debt would speed up the timeline for when the country can start to receive dividends, it said. Oyu Tolgoi is one of the largest known copper and gold deposits in the world. The Mongolian government has 34% ownership, with the rest held by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., which is 51% owned by Rio. The mine is Rio’s flagship growth project, but has increasingly become a headache. Mongolia has been pushing for better terms as costs spiraled, with the investment needed for the underground expansion ballooning to $1.4 billion more than originally planned. Rio in October said Covid-related disruptions had furthered delayed its start and added to cost overruns. Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill made an offer “which aims to reset the relationship and allow all parties to move forward together,” the miner said in a statement.
