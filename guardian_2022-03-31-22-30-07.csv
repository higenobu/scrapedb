3/31/2022,"Keir Starmer has said the public should be told if the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, receives a fixed penalty notice for breaking lockdown rules. No 10 has said it will reveal whether the prime minister – or the cabinet secretary, Simon Case – have received a fine, but have suggested other individuals will not be named. The Metropolitan police announced earlier this week that it would issue 20 fixed penalty notices as a result of its investigation into 12 gatherings held in Downing Street while Covid restrictions were in place. One of these was a party allegedly held by Carrie Johnson in the Downing Street flat, and another was a birthday gathering for the prime minister, organised by his wife, at which Johnson’s ministerial colleague Conor Burns subsequently claimed he was “ambushed by a cake”. Starmer told broadcasters on Thursday: “If Carrie Johnson gets a fixed penalty notice, then of course it should be made public.” He added: “My focus is on the prime minister because he is the one who sets the culture, he is the one who oversaw this criminality at his home and his office, he is the one that came to parliament and said all rules were complied with, which is clearly not the case.” With the Met’s investigation continuing, it is unclear which gatherings the penalties issued so far relate to. Johnson appeared to clash with the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, on Wednesday, with Raab saying the 20 penalties showed there were “clearly breaches of the regulations”, while the prime minister continued to insist he could not give a “running commentary” on the investigation. Asked about the discrepancy, Johnson’s official spokesperson said that while “the facts are not in dispute”, because of the prime minister’s direct involvement in the process it was felt it would not be right for him to comment before the police investigation was entirely finished. He said: “Clearly, this is something that’s been centred on both No 10 and the Cabinet Office in the main – and we’ve confirmed that the prime minister has received a questionnaire – but I think it was simply the prime minister’s view that while there is an ongoing live investigation, it wouldn’t be right for him to give his response at that point.” Starmer was speaking as he launched Labour’s campaign for the 5 May local elections in Bury, in which the party will focus on the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader told activists: “We’ve got exactly five weeks to send a message to Boris Johnson and his Tories that they can’t ignore. A message that Britain deserves better than their pathetic, their miserable response to the cost of living crisis.” He said the public were facing “prices through the roof, wages through the floor”, but the government’s response had been “to take more than they give”. Labour hope to show progress in the elections, though the last time that most of the seats up for grabs were contested, in 2018, the party performed relatively well.",News/UK news,"Public should know if PM’s wife gets police fine, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/public-should-know-if-carrie-johnson-gets-police-fine-says-keir-starmer
3/31/2022,"Joe Biden is planning to release up to one million barrels of oil a day from the strategic reserve, in an attempt to contain spiraling gasoline prices and curb inflation exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The US president could announce that he is ordering the release as early as Thursday, when the White House has indicated Biden will speak about how he intends to lower petrol prices. The administration is reportedly considering extending the release for as long as six months, with a potential limit of 180m barrels drawn from the current national reserve of 568m barrels. The possible injection into the market of oil reserves, first reported by Bloomberg, comes as the Biden administration is wrestling with the political fallout of high petrol prices and rising inflation. According to the American Automobile Association, the US average now stands at $4.23 a gallon, up from $2.87 a year ago. Extraordinary measures including gas rebates are being considered by California, the worst hit state, where an average gallon of petrol now costs close to $6. Any US release of national reserves is likely to be coordinated with other countries under the auspices of the International Energy Agency. Opec oil producers have so far resisted increasing output in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, insisting there is no global shortage. As part of its sanctions for the Ukraine invasion, the Biden administration earlier this month imposed a ban on Russian oil imports. Russia is the second largest exporter of crude oil in the world. High oil prices are causing a mounting headache for Biden ahead of November’s midterm elections. Inflation rose to a 40-year high in January, with prices rising by 7.5% on the previous year. Republican leaders have orchestrated a relentless campaign of partisan attacks against Biden over oil prices. Kevin McCarthy, minority leader of the House, has said: “These aren’t Putin prices. They’re President Biden’s prices.” Should Biden go ahead with a new round of releases from the stockpile it would be the third in recent months. In November he ordered the release of 50m barrels alongside other countries, and a further release of 30m barrels was made after the Ukraine war began. The latest release would be drawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The emergency stockpile, which is intended to protect the country’s access to oil in cases of natural disasters or national security issues, sits in salt dome caverns along the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Oil prices dropped sharply on Thursday in the wake of news breaking of Biden’s expected announcement.",News/Business,US plans to release oil from strategic reserve to bring down gas prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/us-release-oil-strategic-reserve-gas-price
3/31/2022,"Oil prices have dropped after White House officials said the US was considering a record-breaking release of crude oil reserves to allay fears of shortages after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A barrel of Brent crude fell more than 5% to $105.50 (£80.40) on Thursday as traders digested the impact of the largest-ever release since the reserve was created in 1975. The war in Ukraine has sparked concerns that sanctions against Russia, which is the world’s largest exporter of oil to global markets and the second largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia, would lead to a cut in supplies. Brent crude hit $139 a barrel earlier this month after sanctions were slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Oil prices have fallen back since then, but Brent crude is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. White House officials said Joe Biden would make a statement at 1.30pm local time (1830 BST), to set out “his administration’s actions to reduce the impact of [Vladimir] Putin’s price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families”. The US is the world’s largest oil producer, producing about 12m barrels a day. Russia produces about 10m barrels a day. Traders said the signal from the US administration of higher flows of oil into the international system combined with lower than expected manufacturing output in China could depress prices further. Beijing has continued to lock down cities affected by a handful of Covid-19 cases, limiting factory production in March. While some Chinese officials have hinted at a change of policy and the easing of restrictions, President Xi Jinping has maintained tough rules on individuals and businesses once coronavirus has been detected. The oil cartel – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) – and its allies including Russia were due to meet on Thursday to agree production limits. They were expected to maintain an existing deal to gradually increase production. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said its was noteworthy that despite Biden pledging the biggest release from the reserve since the 1970s, oil remains stubbornly above $100 per barrel. He said: “You can understand why the US leader felt he had to do something, given the political heat he is getting for rising fuel prices, however, a speculated release of one million barrels of oil per day over the coming months has to be seen in the context of total global output of around 100m barrels per day. “Really this is tinkering at the margins. What might put more of a brake on prices is action by Opec at its meeting later but the extent to which it could increase production, even if it wanted to, is open to question.” Mould said the slowdown in China might persist, further easing pressure on prices. “The other key focus remains the war in Ukraine with mounting scepticism over the destiny of the latest round of peace talks,” he said. “The market may have to accept this will be a protracted conflict and adjust its assumptions accordingly.” Some Opec+ members have struggled to fulfil their production quotas, limiting the fall in prices over recent weeks. Opec’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have spare production capacity but have held off increasing their output and upsetting the group’s agreed allotments. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE voted for a UN resolution calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine but have stressed that they see the role of Opec+ as stabilising world oil markets and separate from international politics. The United Arab Emirates’ energy minister said Russia, with its 10m barrels of oil a day, was an important member of Opec+. “And leaving the politics aside, that volume is needed today,” Suhail Al Mazroui said on Monday. “Unless someone is willing to come and bring 10m barrels, we don’t see that someone can substitute Russia.”",News/Business,Oil prices fall after US ponders record-breaking release of crude reserves,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/oil-prices-fall-us-ponders-release-crude-reserves
3/31/2022,"The Conservative peer chosen to oversee regulation of the internet has said he does not use social media but is aware of how it works thanks to his children. Michael Grade confirmed to MPs that he was not on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook and had never been tempted by a “dance video” on TikTok. Despite this he said he enough understanding of the key issues to be chair of the media regulator, Ofcom, which has been tasked with implementing the forthcoming online safety bill that will impose new standards on tech companies. He told parliament: “I wouldn’t say I have no experience – I have three kids. I have a 23-year-old student son who is never off his screen. I do understand the dynamics. We can’t be experts in every single aspect of the turf that Ofcom has to patrol.” The SNP MP John Nicolson suggested Lord Grade’s “lack of engagement with such an important part of contemporary life” could prove problematic when regulating the internet. The 79-year-old’s career was mainly spent in broadcast television at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. While discussing so-called cancel culture, Grade also defended the right of Laurence Fox, the actor turned anti-lockdown campaigner, to express his views. He said: “I have known his family. His grandfather and my father were partners in business going back a long way. I admire his courage in speaking out and contributing to the debate. I don’t necessarily agree with what he says, but I admire him speaking out.” The veteran broadcasting executive was named last week as the government’s preferred choice to lead the media regulator following a chaotic two-year search for a suitable candidate. Although he was obliged to appear in front of a pre-confirmation hearing of MPs, they have no ability to block his appointment, which followed the government’s failed attempts to install the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre in the role. Grade said he was a long-term “adversary” of Dacre, with the Daily Mail labelling him Britain’s “pornographer-in-chief” in the 1990s when he was putting programmes such as The Word and Brass Eye on Channel 4. He also stood by his comments that Channel 4 would be better off privatised, as well his description of the BBC licence fee as “regressive”. He said it was up to parliament to decide on a future funding model for the national broadcaster: “I described the licence fee as regressive. I didn’t think that was an opinion, I thought that was a statement of fact, actually.” The Conservative peer said his three-year tenure overseeing the media regulator would be judged on whether he was successful at “cleaning up the excesses” of the internet. Grade said a key issue for Ofcom was hiring highly skilled staff to regulate social media platforms because it would be hard to compete with the likes of Facebook for technical staff. “Goodness knows what they pay their algorithm authors – if that’s the right word – and they’re very, very smart people.” If, as expected, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, confirms Grade’s appointment, he will give up the Tory whip and switch to sitting as a crossbench peer in the House of Lords. At one point Grade was asked whether it was acceptable for the television channel Talking Pictures to air repeats of The Black and White Minstrel Show. The former BBC light entertainment hit – which ended in 1978 – is now decried for its use of blackface and other racist tropes. “I actually cancelled The Black and White Minstrel Show,” claimed Grade, who was working at the ITV franchise London Weekend Television when the BBC took the show off air.",News/Media,Government’s choice for Ofcom chair says he does not use social media,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/31/government-choice-ofcom-chair-michael-grade-does-not-use-social-media
3/31/2022,"We are spiraling further into climate and ecological breakdown. Now is the perfect moment to build out renewables and end the fossil fuel industry as if the future of humanity depends on it. Putin’s unprovoked and atrocious invasion of Ukraine has laid bare many things. One of these is our society’s precarious dependence on fossil fuels. Another is a burgeoning climate-driven food crisis. It’s time to phase out fossil fuels and industrial beef production with wartime resolve. Any reasonable person can look at today’s climate impacts – the droughts, famines, floods, fires, storms, ecosystem losses, and deadly heat – see that they are caused primarily by burning fossil fuels, read the IPCC summary reports that project how much worse they will get and how irreversible the damage will be, and conclude that we must end the fossil fuel production as quickly as we can. Any one of the catastrophes I’ve listed should be reason enough to do so. Taken together, they indicate nothing less than the eventual end of civilization as we know it. On top of this, Putin’s brutal war is funded primarily by the flow of gas and oil out of his country. Partly because the human brain finds war more “immediate” than climate breakdown, this has suddenly increased public awareness of the dangers of our fossil fuel addiction. Tragically, the Biden administration is choosing to expand the fossil fuel industry at this critical moment. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki recently bragged that “US production of natural gas and oil is rising and approaching record levels” and that “trendlines also point up,” as if these are good things. The administration has approved new drilling permits at rates far exceeding even Trump. Fossil fuel executives and investors are planning to increase production indefinitely, at least through 2035, demonstrating their belief that the politicians they’ve bought will continue to ignore the public’s desire for climate action. This takes us in the opposite direction we need to head. Personally, as a climate scientist and a dad, I feel increasingly desperate. Butterflies-in-my-stomach desperate. It is psychologically brutal to see this climate train wreck worsen while world leaders not only fail to stop it, but hasten it. It is brutal to live with the knowledge that we are in the process of losing our livable Earth. The gap between what the science is saying and how world leaders and the public are responding is so vast that I often have to pinch myself by going back to the scientific findings. Yes, this is all really happening; no, I’m actually not being alarmist. Global food systems present an interconnected dimension of concern. Russia and Ukraine together produce 30% of the world’s wheat; 50 countries, including many in the global south, depend critically on Russia and Ukraine for grain. Putin’s war leaves them especially vulnerable. We are entering a new epoch of energy and food price volatility and increases, which will hurt the global poor and working class most of all; shifting away from meat, especially beef, would act as a shock absorber. Beef requires 20 times the land area and creates 20 times the climate impact of plant-based protein. There is no place for industrial beef on a planet in a deepening food and climate crisis. A visionary leader would seize this moment to reduce consumption while protecting low-income households and preventing the rich from profiting off this global crisis. Doing so needs to start in the bully pulpit. A visionary leader would highlight climate peril and commonsense solutions at every opportunity, in state of the union addresses and press conferences, in special addresses and public education campaigns. A visionary leader would use executive actions and focused congressional bills to take commonsense actions to transition rapidly away from fossil fuels and beef, while providing credits, tax relief, and other support to the working class. The prospect of far higher gas and food prices in the future clarifies the critical relationship between wealth equity and climate action: for any hope of climate action, public support is crucial. In the short term, we need a Green New Deal buildout, which will create jobs, economic growth, and goodwill for the transition. In the medium term, we will need to switch our driving economic goal away from maximizing GDP and toward maximizing human flourishing in balance with the rest of the living Earth. Biden says he “listens to scientists”. But if he listened to climate scientists like me and my colleagues, many of whom are now as terrified as I am, he would understand that climate breakdown literally threatens everything. He would understand that he can either be for stopping climate breakdown or for boosting oil and gas production, but not both.

3/31/2022,"The past week has seen ever stronger indications that Russia has recognised it cannot achieve its aim of conquering Ukraine by military force. Suggestions tied to peace talks in Ukraine that Russia was pulling back from its attempt to encircle Kyiv tie in with the earlier declaration that its war aims were limited to conquering the eastern part of the country. And even before that, both Russia and Ukraine had stated that peace negotiations were moving into a phase of substantive discussions instead of Russia simply presenting ultimatums. Russia’s claim that it is scaling back operations around Kyiv and focusing its offensive on the east of the country is one of those rare occasions when a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defence actually aligns recognisably with the truth. The reality gap arises not in what Russia is doing, but why it is claiming it is doing it. Russia has presented thisits withdrawal of units from around Kyiv as some kind of concession – to “boost mutual trust” around the peace talks. But it was already clear that its offensive there had stalled, and in some case been reversed, by dogged Ukrainian resistance. The pivot to operations in the east and the rotation out of battered Russian units from Ukraine’s northern flank is a recognition by Moscow that – as many military analysts had predicted before the current conflict – it simply does not have the deployable forces it would need to conquer all of Ukraine along multiple axes of advance. In fact, Russia is having to scrape the manpower barrel just to keep its current operations going. The troop buildup ahead of the onslaught on Ukraine saw units brought in from as far as the Arctic and the far east. Now that many of these have been mauled in the fighting in Ukraine, Russia is drawing on all possible sources of additional bodies, including bringing in mercenaries and recruiting in Syria. But while evidence of Ukraine’s success in fending off at least some of the Russian offensives may mean that the country as a whole is not in immediate danger of being overrun, the risk to Ukraine’s future as a sovereign nation remains. Russia has a long track record of starting wars disastrously, but then succeeding in throwing sufficient manpower and material into the conflict to grind down its opponents through sheer mass. The danger is that Russia can continue a war of attrition, regardless of the cost in casualties among poorly trained troops or the damage done to Russia’s own economy, longer than Ukraine can maintain the interest and support of the west. And in the meantime, Russia will continue to engineer humanitarian disasters in order to put pressure on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to make concessions in order to end the fighting. The capital itself will continue to be under threat. Suspending attempts to push forward and seize more territory around Kyiv does not mean that Russia will cease mounting long-range missile and artillery strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities from those areas it does already control. That Russian pressure will be both direct, presenting Zelenskiy with the appalling choice of continuing the fighting at the cost of innocent lives or making concessions to end the suffering, and indirect, if Zelenskiy’s western backers modify their advice – and their support – because they do not feel Ukraine should resist further in the face of humanitarian catastrophe. Zelenskiy has already indicated that “neutral” status for Ukraine would be an outcome he would accept in order to end the fighting. But this in itself is fraught with dangers. He knows as well as anyone that “neutral with security guarantees” was precisely Ukraine’s status a decade ago, and that did nothing to prevent Russia from seizing Crimea and beginning its war in eastern Ukraine. So, in order to be meaningful at all, the same words would have to conceal a radically different international status and set of foreign backers for Ukraine than in 2014. And there is always the danger that a temporary ceasefire – encouraged by a conflict-averse west – may evolve into a permanent division of the country, cementing Russian territorial gains. Optimism for resistance to occupation by the Ukrainian population in those areas controlled by Russia, and those it still could conquer in its eastern offensive, conceals a grim reality. The sad fact is that Moscow has a very high success rate in crushing resistance movements and insurgencies, largely through the application of unlimited barbarism against the civil population that sustains them. So if Russia does decide to occupy territory it already holds, the only thing likely to dislodge it is further and much more substantial Ukrainian military offensives – which may not be within the scope of possibilities for Kyiv. In the end much depends on what Russia itself will define as “victory”. It has already reinvented its original war aims because it failed to achieve them. The expectation that Ukrainians were just frustrated Russians awaiting liberation from an imaginary neo-Nazi gang that had seized power in Kyiv was torpedoed by its first encounter with reality on the ground in Ukraine. Far from the whole country falling swiftly into Russia’s hands, Moscow must fight for every inch of Ukrainian territory. So whatever victory it may eventually claim, it is unlikely to look anything like what Russia thought it was setting out to do in the first place. But that matters little when it has established such control over public opinion at home that much of its population think it is waging a defensive war; in effect, a Russian declaration of success does not in any way depend on the reality of the war’s outcome. The longer-term problem is that if Vladimir Putin comes away from this war convincing himself that Russia has achieved anything other than substantial defeat, there is nothing to deter him from continuing his plans for wars of conquest to reassert Moscow’s control over the territories and peoples he claims are independent by mistake. Russia may need time to rebuild its military and reorient its economy for the new sanctions regime, but the only thing that will change Putin’s ambition is clear and unarguable failure that cannot be explained away through the sleight of hand of redefining what Russia wanted from the war. Now, just as at the outset of the war, the west has the responsibility of assisting Ukraine in bringing about that failure. Keir Giles works with the Russia and Eurasia programme of Chatham House, and is the author of Moscow Rules: What Drives Russia to Confront the West",Opinion/Opinion,Only total military failure will curb Putin's ambitions in Ukraine | Keir Giles,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/31/military-failure-putin-ambitions-ukraine
3/31/2022,"For a spy chief, it was an eye-catching claim. “We believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth,” the GCHQ boss, Sir Jeremy Fleming, confidently declared overnight to an audience in Australia. The head of the British eavesdropping agency offered no details to back up his assertion – leaving the impression it was a piece of psychological warfare, of the “we know all is not well in the Kremlin” type. Nor was it an isolated comment – a few hours earlier US officials were in similar terrain, showing the effort was coordinated. “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military,” one said, stating that in particular the leader did not know at first that conscripts were being used in the war. Given Russia’s failure to achieve a quick victory over Ukraine, such conclusions are on the face of it hardly surprising. And the Russian president’s dominance over the Kremlin and key figures within it is hardly a revelation. Fleming’s remarks are intended to bring to mind how the Russian president publicly treated Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the SVR foreign intelligence agency, a meeting intended to agree the recognition of self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine. “Speak plainly,” a smirking Putin repeated as Naryshkin stumbled over his answers to the Russian leader, perhaps enjoying the moment of fear that played across the face of his subordinate, normally considered a powerful hardliner who has known the president since the early 1990s at least. GCHQ insiders are reluctant to get into detail at the best of times, although they insist such Kreminology is not conducted idly. But it is hard to avoid the impression that such statements have a propagandist quality when they are inserted into a speech given by a spy chief and inevitably picked up by the media. Fleming’s speech also contained another unsupported statement, that Russian forces have been “even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft” (this is intended to be a plural) – a statement that can only have the purpose of highlighting to the Kremlin what the west believes it can see. Former Whitehall insiders are divided about whether it is wise for intelligence chiefs to make such sweeping statements. “My view is that Fleming should only speak on the basis of intelligence or he risks misinforming the west,” said one former intelligence insider, who asked not to be named. But Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, said it was obvious that Putin had become “isolated and intolerant of criticism” and said it was a “continuation of the pre-conflict practice of putting out the intel assessment without revealing the sources”. It is certainly true that prewar western intelligence predictions have been proven correct. They forecast that Russia would, on Putin’s orders, invade Ukraine and attempt to win a quick victory by encircling Kyiv and other major cities – although most thought the invaders would be more successful that has been proven. But now Fleming appears to be seeking to personalise responsibility for the war. “It increasingly looks Putin has massively misjudged the situation,” the spy chief also said, again a fairly obvious comment, but arguably not very diplomatic given that almost any ceasefire and peace settlement will almost certainly have to involve the Russian leader. There is also a risk that the west has become overconfident about Russian divisions and difficulties – and risked exaggerating claims, as happened in the run-up to the Iraq war. “It was true that an Iraqi unit had a 45-minute chemical weapon readiness order. That didn’t mean what was then said in parliament and reported in the media”, the long-serving former official recalled.",News/World news,Why is GCHQ saying Putin has been misinformed about Ukraine war?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/why-is-gchq-saying-putin-has-been-misinformed-about-ukraine-war
3/31/2022,"Paris climate agreement goals will fail unless the rights of Indigenous people who protect rainforests are honoured, according to a new report. Forest lands stewarded by Indigenous people and communities in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru sequester about twice as much carbon as other lands, according to the analysis. To meet national climate goals – known as NDCs – without protecting this land would require draconian and abrupt lifestyle changes in forested countries. Peru would have to take all vehicles off the roads to compensate for losing just half of the carbon sinks protected by Indigenous and community-held forests, says the study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and Climate Focus. Brazil and Colombia would have to retire 80% of their vehicles to compensate for the increase in net emissions. Juan-Carlos Altamirano, a senior economist at the WRI, who co-authored the paper, said: “It would be impossible for these countries to attain the NDC objectives if Indigenous rights are not protected and these lands are deforested or put to other uses. But in other parts of the world, it would likely be the same case.” If the rights of Indigenous people and forest communities were not protected, the “most likely hypothesis” would be a failure to achieve the Paris climate goal of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C, he said. Indigenous people are by far the best rainforest custodians, with deforestation rates on their lands up to 50% lower than elsewhere, according to a UN study last year. While an estimated 10% of the south-east Amazon appears to have already become a net carbon source owing to forest degradation, the WRI says that at least 92% of forested lands held by Indigenous peoples and communities in Amazonian countries are still carbon sinks. On average, these lands sequester more than 30 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent a hectare, more than twice as much as other lands. In Brazil, however, the Jair Bolsonaro government has undermined Indigenous people’s protection agencies and fast-tracked legislation to open their lands to mining, oil and gas exploration, hydroelectric dams and soy plantations. Brazil’s deforestation rate soared by 57% last year to the highest level in a decade. Izabella Teixeira, a former Brazilian environment minister honoured by the UN for helping to reverse Amazonian deforestation, said Bolsonaro offered only “a fake green, short-term perspective”, aimed at fooling the international community. “Be sure: the interest of the Brazilian government today is not to address climate change or environmental damage,” she said. “Indigenous people have [constitutional] rights and the state should protect Indigenous people, and what has happened today is not this,” she said. “Indigenous people and environmental constituencies are being seen as part of the problem.” To maximise the scope for Indigenous land protection, the WRI study calls for equivalent land ownership rights, legal recognition of Indigenous territories and community rights to free, prior and informed consent over forest projects. The study was compiled by using satellite data to identify the carbon content, emissions and sequestration on land inhabited by Indigenous people and local communities. These were then compared with the four Latin American countries’ NDCs [nationally determined contributions] to the Paris climate agreement to see if they were included in policy planning. “In most cases they were not,” Altamirano said.",News/World news,"Protect Indigenous people’s rights or Paris climate goals will fail, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/protect-indigenous-peoples-rights-or-paris-climate-goals-will-fail-says-report
3/31/2022,"There are few people present in the Almeida theatre offices in London when Jeremy O Harris walks in on a Monday evening in March. He is wearing Gucci head-to-toe: a multicoloured check wool suit and, over it, a grey monogram coat embellished with small jewels that glitter intensely under the ceiling’s studio lights. Is this an everyday look, I wonder. “It’s the first day of rehearsal for Daddy,” Harris, 32, explains, “so it feels like a good way to be like: ‘Let’s get jazzy.’ It was also on loan so I have to give it back tomorrow.” Although we are indeed speaking on the first day of rehearsals for Daddy, which went on to open at the Almeida last month, it’s not Harris’s first time bringing the play to the UK. Original plans for it to debut in 2020 were quickly halted by the pandemic. “We were doing the play here two years ago today,” he says. “I think me and Danya [Taymor, the director] were downstairs with Rupert [Goold, artistic director] being like: ‘America just shut down the NBA, I think it’s probably gonna be game over for theatre.’” Sure enough, the Almeida theatre closed on 16 March 2020, and Harris found himself stuck in the UK, living in a flat in London until August. “I got very comfortable being in a foreign city during a very foreign time,” he says. Despite a global standstill, Harris’s star continued to rise in the United States, with success meeting him in off-stage platforms. In early 2020, it was announced that he had signed on to become a co-producer of teen drama Euphoria, and was developing a pilot show for HBO. He also co-wrote the screenplay for the 2021 film Zola, based on a viral Twitter thread about a waitress and stripper in Detroit. Now, three years after Daddy debuted in 2019 in New York, Harris is finally ready to meet a British audience for the first time. While he is town for Daddy, it was Slave Play, which premiered in New York in 2018, that saw him explode on to the scene as one of the most talked-about and provocative playwrights of his generation. The show has been a runaway success, with Rihanna, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hiddleston, Zawe Ashton, Madonna and Gloria Steinem seen in attendance. Its February to March 2022 west coast run at Center Theatre Group grossed $1.4m (£1m) in five weeks, despite offering almost 5,000 free and discounted tickets. Billed as an “antebellum fever dream”, Slave Play sees three interracial couples participate in “Sexual Performance Therapy”, comprising slavery role play intended to improve the intimacy and sexual pleasure of each partnership through reckoning with intergenerational racial trauma. Naturally, such a premise attracted significant commotion, including a petition signed by 6,400 people calling for it to be shut down. “I thought it was hilarious,” Harris says, nearly leaping out of his seat in laughter. “And crazy. Because most of the people who signed the petition had never seen the play. The petition happened when the play had maybe 30 performances off-Broadway, and the number of people who signed the petition was more than the theatre could have possibly held.” A recurring problem Harris feels he faces is audiences forming conclusions about his plays before even purchasing a ticket. “I think a lot of people’s responses to the play are based on projection,” he continues. “That’s why there’s a mirror on stage in that play. A lot of my plays have mirrors in them – this play [Daddy] has a pool in it. A pool is a very large mirror. And I think that I like to make work that deals with psyches to such a degree that people’s own psyches start to battle the work as they walk out of the theatre.” Daddy is less explicitly about race than Slave Play, but the audience perception of the relationship between Franklin, a young Black debutante artist, and Andre, an older, wealthy white art collector, is understandably shaped by a US context in which race and gay interracial relationships in particular are politically charged. Last year, the wealthy Democratic donor Ed Buck was sentenced to a minimum 20 years in prison after the fatal meth overdoses of two young African American men in his home. Did Buck’s crimes warp US perceptions of Daddy? “I think that if people needed the spectre of Ed Buck to know that there have been histories of predation of young Black men by older white men, older men in general, then I don’t know how to help them,” says Harris. “My hope is that people are coming to the play with these questions in their mind about any sort of entanglement that looks like that. Because that is part of the engine of the play.” Is Daddy therefore a study of predation? “No,” he answers assertively. So what is the dynamic? “I would say: see the play.” He prefers that audiences come into his shows blind. “I love that. It’s my ideal. Because then you’re just coming with whatever you’ve projected on to the three lines you’ve read about it on the internet.” Harris grew up in a military family in the southern US, eventually settling in Virginia. He became engrossed in theatre and literature from a young age, finding that they equipped him with the intellectual armour to combat bullying. Although he says that his work is not autobiographical, it is informed by “trauma”, which he describes as “wildly important” for the formation of his stories. “Looking through my histories and my wounds is the only thing that really excites me,” he says. “And finding humour in those things really excites me. And stretching them out and reshaping them into other things is really cool. Otherwise I’m just living with some wound that disfigures me in certain ways.” Having broken through so young, and with stage plays that were written at the beginning of his career reaching international attention, does Harris ever feel he is defined by works that he has emotionally moved on from? He gracefully dismisses the idea. “I think that would be like asking if Tennessee Williams should be upset that he’s defined by The Glass Menagerie or A Streetcar Named Desire. I think a lot of artists write exhilarating work in their early 20s because we write best when we’re hungry. But later there’s a beautiful thing that can happen for a mid- or late-career artist where, because they’re fed, they’re able to write with even more nuance. Nuance is what we get from older writers, and what we get from younger writers is brazen ambition that rips a hole in the fabric of the universe.” Slave Play’s success means that Harris has been offered the resources to “make his wildest dreams come true”; Daddy is worth seeing for its use of an infinity pool alone. (“Were there an award for best supporting body of water, this highly expressive pool would be a shoo-in,” wrote the New York Times.) Still, he doesn’t meet theatres purely with gratitude but with real, rigorous challenge. He doesn’t shy away from the fact that his audience at the Almeida will be overwhelmingly white and middle class. “I do not want to play into a history that denies Black people equal footing getting into these doors,” he says. “There’s not a history of doing a lot of Black work here,” he says, “and we’ve had really great discussions and really intense outreach in order to change not only what’s happening for this play but what will happen for other plays in the future.” In 2021, Harris withdrew Slave Play from its LA run at the Center Theatre Group in protest at a lack of female playwrights in the season’s lineup. He takes this duty towards Black female artists seriously: prior to this withdrawal, Harris had created $50,000-worth of commissions for new works by Black female playwrights at the New York Theater Workshop. Does he now have certain terms and conditions for theatres before he works with them? “I think I’m figuring that out now. I’m still so young, and this is very much the beginning of my career, and I’m starting to learn how to use my privilege to the best of its ability.” As for the future of Harris’s work, it is without boundaries. Despite his HBO deal, he doesn’t intend to abandon theatre anytime soon; he sees all of these artistic mediums as sitting side by side in his career. “If you look at some of the greatest playwrights of the 20th century, even Caryl Churchill had radio plays and plays happening at the same time. Debbie tucker green has written for television. Alice Birch wrote Normal People. I hope that I’m able to have a healthy career anywhere my brain takes me.” His career is certainly in rude health, and his ability to “cause all this conversation” (to borrow a line from Beyoncé) cannot be overstated. “No one wants to start a production with a whisper,” he says. “I hope that the play invites a lot of excitement.” Daddy is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 30 April.",Arts/Stage,Jeremy O Harris: ‘I’m starting to learn how to use my privilege’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/31/jeremy-o-harris-im-starting-to-learn-how-to-use-my-privilege
3/31/2022,"Very rarely will you have heard Namibian rugby union and Cornish rugby league mentioned in the same breath: but then again, very few people have a story to tell quite like Neil Kelly. The 59-year-old’s journey has taken him from the heartlands of rugby league, playing for clubs such as Featherstone and Wakefield with great distinction, to a coaching career that has included stints in Ireland, America and Namibia. This Saturday, Kelly begins arguably the most intriguing challenge of his rugby career as he takes charge of Cornwall in their inaugural match as a rugby league club. Founded last November after a successful bid acquired the professional licence initially earmarked for a Canadian franchise in Ottawa that never materialised, the Rugby Football League’s approval of the Cornish bid, marks the first time in history the region has had a professional rugby league team. It is the latest ambitious step in rugby league’s plans to expand beyond its heartlands and a fascinating moment for a region of more than 500,000 people that has only one other professional sporting team to its name, rugby union’s Cornish Pirates. “I’ve coached all over the world in so many environments, but never encountered anything like this,” Kelly tells the Guardian ahead of Cornwall’s first game in League 1, rugby league’s third tier, this weekend when they will face another expansion side, North Wales Crusaders. “The real attraction was the fact it’s a start-up and I can help mould a club in my image, but also the region. It’s incredible, there’s so many people, and so many chances to get new people attracted to rugby league.” Cornwall will play their home games in Penryn and while previous expansion clubs have arrived in rugby league with a bluster of pomp and circumstance about their goals to reach the top, those on the ground in Cornwall are somewhat more measured. They have assembled an inaugural squad mixed with experienced northern players – including the former Super League winner Anthony Mullally – and a group of Cornish rugby union players, some of whom will be playing their first ever game of league on Saturday, with a long-term plan in mind. “It was really important that it wasn’t a team of one or the other,” Rob Butland, one of the men behind the project, explains. “There’s a huge web of talent down here in Cornwall, and incredible athletes that love rugby. “It was important we didn’t just go all-out and bring in a squad that had no connection with the region at all, though it means we’ll have to work harder on the field. This is a big moment for Cornwall, but a big moment for the sport.” This is not a project without some foundations, though. For over a decade, the Cornish Rebels have competed at amateur level in the south and has given men like Butland at least some experience to call upon when trying to lay down league roots in a union-dominated area. “We’ve spent a long time doing it and whilst that has always had its challenges we’ve done a good job with what we were able to,” he explains. “That was one thing, but now we’re in a national competition, with a chance to progress. The Rebels were the foundations, this is the real business now.” League 1 is a mix of traditional heartlands clubs including Oldham and Keighley, coupled with expansion projects like Midlands Hurricanes, North Wales and Cornwall. With that in mind, there is perhaps no surprise those involved with Cornwall are expecting some tough, formative afternoons in their debut season against the division’s established sides. “I’m a bit nervous for the boys,” Kelly says. “For some of them, this is going to be their first game of rugby league. We’ve been thrown together, recruitment is ongoing and we’ve only had about an eight-week pre-season. Most clubs have at least 12.” Kelly hopes Cornwall can be strong enough to finish above their expansion rivals in 2022, which in itself would be a huge achievement. But with the club promising a sustainable approach, this project is perhaps more geared towards long-term benefits for rugby league, with development programmes already being put in place to attract future rugby league players in Cornwall. “I’d ask all rugby league fans to be patient and look at the long-term vision we have here,” Kelly says. “If we can get this right as a game, we’re tapping into a region of 500,000 people for the first time.” Butland agrees. “It’s probably bigger than any other expansion plan that we’ve ever seen,” he declares. “If we get Cornwall right, we’re suddenly way beyond rugby league’s heartlands. The problem rugby league has had in this country for years is that the best rugby league player in the world may never actually play the game because of where he was born. It’s projects like Cornwall that will change that.”",Sport/Sport,‘This is a big moment’: Cornwall opens up new frontier for rugby league | Aaron Bower,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/if-we-get-cornwall-right-were-way-beyond-rugby-leagues-heartlands
3/31/2022,"The UK will pay an economic price for failing to consider long Covid when lifting restrictions and recommending vaccinations for children, a doctor has warned. The decision to drop all Covid rules in England was largely based on whether the NHS could handle the number of sick patients, but far more people are expected to develop long-term medical problems after fighting off the virus. Speaking at a Royal Society conference on the Science of Covid on Thursday, Dr Nathalie MacDermott, a specialist in paediatric infectious disease at King’s College London, said high levels of infection would result in more long Covid that would blight people’s lives, harm children’s education and undermine the economy. “We talk about hospitalisations and we talk about deaths, but I don’t hear people saying long Covid is an issue. We need to consider that when we adjust our public health measures, when we introduce different measures to try and contain this pandemic, or we decide to not have any measures whatsoever,” she said. “Economically, that is going to be to our downfall in the coming years.” The Office for National Statistics estimates that 1.5 million people in UK households are living with long Covid, where symptoms from fatigue and brain fog to loss of smell and taste persist for more than four weeks after infection. Nearly half of those surveyed by the ONS reported ailments lasting at least a year. Older people, women, and obese people are most at risk of long Covid. MacDermott caught Covid two years ago and now has to take cabs to work and use a mobility scooter after developing long Covid, also known as post-Covid syndrome. Beyond the impact it has on individuals’ lives, she said, the condition would have a substantial impact on people’s ability to work, their earning potential, and costs to government and businesses. “That’s going to be a significant hit to our economy, not just to people’s lives.” It is unclear how well Covid vaccines reduce the risk of long Covid, but MacDermott said decisions on who to vaccinate should have taken long Covid into account. The government’s vaccine adviser, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, was cautious about recommending Covid vaccines for children, partly because of rare side effects, but about one in 50 infected children are expected to develop long Covid. While that is a small percentage, high infection rates mean many will miss school and not fulfil their academic potential, MacDermott said. “Why was that not considered when we were considering vaccinating children?” she asked the meeting. Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said he “couldn’t agree more strongly” with MacDermott. “There seems a binary difference between the urgent policy immediacy of dealing with fatalities from an acute pandemic, and a willingness, globally, to kick the can down the road in relation to a massive, persistent disease pandemic that we’ll be grappling with messily for years to come,” he said.",News/Society,"Failure to consider long Covid impact will hit UK economy, says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/failure-to-consider-long-covid-impact-will-hit-uk-economy-says-expert
3/31/2022,"The death of Donald “Tabby Diamond” Shaw aged 67 in a drive-by shooting brings a terribly tragic end to one of reggae’s most enduring and revered harmony trios. No word has yet emerged about who was behind the attack that killed Shaw and another man on the night of 29 March on McKinley Crescent, Waterhouse, an area of Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, long riven by factional violence. Equally adept at songs of social commentary and odes of broken-hearted romance, the Mighty Diamonds’ exceptional command of vocal harmony made their sound stand out during the mid-1970s, yielding a contract with Virgin Records and numerous international tours. Tabby’s powerful tenor was always given pride of place, a guiding beacon answered by the choruses of Fitzroy “Bunny” Simpson and Lloyd “Judge” Ferguson, the latter the group’s chief lyricist. On a visit to London in 1997, Shaw said the group came together when its members were working as welders and carpenters; Simpson was running a sound system called Soul Pack, having previously sung in the Meditators with Jah Lloyd. “We start out late 1969, come together in a full force trinity in mid-December,” said Shaw. “Bunny Diamond used to sing with Jah Lloyd’s group named Meditators, and he used to check me, cause we used to live in the same street. We say we want a next man, and it takes about two years; we buck up on some different youths, but they weren’t ready yet, until we buck up on Judge and the vibes start.” Under the name the Dymonds, the group cut their debut single for producer Rupie Edwards, a languorous, bittersweet romance titled Girl You Are Too Young, and although it made only a fleeting impact, the emotive power of Shaw’s tenor was already in evidence. Then, after recording a reggae cover of the Stylistics’ Betcha By Golly Wow, they landed at Lee “Scratch” Perry’s recently-opened Black Ark in 1974, where they recorded the ballad Talk About It. The following year, their riveting harmony on Susan Cadogan’s Hurt So Good helped it reach the UK Top Five. The Rastafari-oriented Jah Jah Bless the Dreadlocks and broken-hearted Carefree Girl followed for hitmaking producer, Bunny “Striker” Lee, but the true breakthrough came through their ongoing affiliation with Jah Lloyd. Lloyd first independently released their hit Shame and Pride on his Teem label; “the song that give them the go,” he told me shortly before his death from a lung condition in 1999. He couldn’t achieve the sales the single deserved because he lacked a proper distribution network, so “this is when I have to carry them to Jo Jo Hoo-Kim, who tell them it’s time fi do them album.” Jo Jo Hoo-Kim and his brother Ernest ran the Channel One studio on Maxfield Avenue in west Kingston, where Jamaica’s most noteworthy hits were recorded in the mid-to-late 70s, thanks in part to the complex rhythms that drummer Sly Dunbar was crafting at the premises, as leader of the Revolutionaries house band. Now renamed the Mighty Diamonds, the group led a pack of artists at Channel One who included Dillinger, the Wailing Souls, John Holt and Leroy Smart, all of whom made a strong impact on both sides of the Atlantic atop the studio’s forward-facing rhythms. “My best experience was Channel One, because it’s the first cut, the foundation,” said Shaw. “Channel One have a time when it used to run things.” The Stylistics cover Country Living was the first of their songs to do well in Britain; the local popularity of Back Weh, I Need A Roof and Have Mercy ultimately brought them on to Virgin, who issued the acclaimed Right Time LP in a gatefold sleeve. The title track was a sizeable hit that related Marcus Garvey’s prophetic vision of Black retribution, becoming a favourite of Black audiences in Britain, as well as sympathetic punks. A Mighty Diamonds concert held at London’s Lyceum in August 1976 is said to be the first to feature a live dub mix, but the bland Ice on Fire, recorded in 1977 with New Orleans-based producer Allen Toussaint, did not live up to its dynamic potential, and the crossover format of Planet Earth similarly missed the mark. During the 1980s, the Mighty Diamonds cut a series of competent albums for producer Gussie Clarke, followed by albums of various quality for myriad others; their acoustic 2008 release for the Inna De Yard project helped keep them in demand on the festival circuit. Throughout, it was Shaw’s voice that kept the Diamonds shining: an unbeatable frontman in live performance who maintained the tone of his tenor right to the end, he will be greatly missed on the Kingston music scene, and among reggae fans worldwide.",Arts/Music,‘A full-force trinity’: the glory and tragedy of reggae group the Mighty Diamonds,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/31/a-full-force-trinity-the-glory-and-tragedy-of-reggae-group-the-mighty-diamonds
3/31/2022,"‘I’ve high hopes of dying young,” announces Joe Orton cheerfully in Diary of a Somebody. He got his wish: the author of barbed, subversive comedies such as Entertaining Mr Sloane and Loot was murdered in 1967 at the age of 34 by his lover Kenneth Halliwell. This play, pieced together by John Lahr from Orton’s journal as well as from correspondence and interviews, has often been overshadowed by the diaries themselves and by Stephen Frears’ 1987 film Prick Up Your Ears, adapted by Alan Bennett from Lahr’s biography of the same name. Seen here in Nico Rao Pimparé’s punchy new staging, its own merits and insights are inarguable. Distance helps: with Aids dominating gay life in the 1980s, and Clause 28 on the horizon, Orton’s priapic endeavours made him seem then like a purely heroic sexual swashbuckler. Now his callousness, along with Halliwell’s suffering, emerge with greater clarity and force. Breakneck action involving nearly 50 minor characters (shared among four supporting cast members: Jemma Churchill, Sorcha Kennedy, Ryan Rajan Mal and Jamie Zubairi) is squeezed on to the cramped stage like glad rags in an overstuffed suitcase. The floor of Valentine Gigandet’s set is tiled with pink-and-yellow squares which visually underscore the tension between the cocksure Orton (George Kemp) and the saturnine, self-loathing Halliwell (Toby Osmond), who keeps adding to the monochrome collage that spreads like damp across the walls of their flat. A black sheet placed on the couple’s bed during a funeral scene provides a chilling harbinger of doom. Kemp is all groin and grins in the hilarious first act before showing how the playwright’s ravenous eye becomes simply cruel – his flashes of misogyny and racism, his poisonous self-regard. Administered to sexually by “boys” in Tangiers, he can only muse boastfully on his status as a celebrated playwright. Meanwhile, Osmond brings revelatory nuances to Halliwell. His penetrating stare may be fearsome but his pain is always intensely human, so that we never forget the cost to him of each laugh. Halliwell insisted in his suicide note that his partner’s diaries would explain all. They didn’t. This production, however, comes that bit closer.

3/31/2022,"SoundState, the Southbank Centre’s five-day celebration of contemporary composers, is the nearest thing London now has to a new-music festival. Stylistically, its programme is a broad church, and that was reflected in the opening concert, which was given by the London Philharmonic, conducted by Edward Gardner. All four works were being heard for the first time in Britain, though only one of them could really be described as new. That was Rebecca Saunders’ To An Utterance, the piano concerto she composed in 2020 for Nicolas Hodges, who played it here too. Saunders gives the soloist only a few bars rest in the entire 28-minute score, as they are taken on a compelling musical journey. She describes the piano part as an “incessant, compulsive soliloquy”; it’s a barrage of glissandos and clusters played with palms and forearms but one that, despite its insistence, is condemned to end in failure, as the orchestra (which includes an accordion, a second piano and an array of exotic percussion) only adds commentary rather than support. Saunders’ concerto, which Hodges played with fierce concentration and sometimes astonishing virtuosity, was by a distance the most impressive work in the concert, though that was no reflection on the involvement and application that Gardner and his orchestra devoted to everything they played. Missy Mazzoli’s 2013 River Rouge Transfiguration, inspired by old photographs of Detroit, inconsequentially unfolds a series of spindly melodic lines and writhing chorales over John Adams-like pulsations. And Adams also appeared to be the model for much of the orchestral writing in Mason Bates’ four-movement symphony Liquid Interface for orchestra and electronica from 2007, in which the pre-recorded sound track only occasionally interacts meaningfully with the live instruments, and seems mostly cosmetic. The concert ended with George Walker’s Sinfonia No 5, Visions, which was written in 2016, just two years before the composer’s death at the age of 96. It was composed as a reaction to the white suprematist shooting of black worshippers at a church in South Carolina the previous year; the anger in the tangled instrumental lines is palpable, but the portentous gestures never resolve, so that the whole piece seems like an extended introduction to an argument that never quite gets under way.

3/31/2022,"The first US rugby union competition to offer professional contracts to women will hold tournaments in July in San Jose, Washington DC and Austin. Premier Rugby Sevens staged a pilot tournament in Memphis, Tennessee last October. This year, as in that event, women’s and men’s squads will compete for equal pay in one-day showcases of the Olympic form of the game. In a new feature, only one champion will be named, based on combined points totals earned by four women’s and four men’s squads. Owen Scannell, chief executive of Premier Rugby Sevens, said: “We are extremely excited to scale PR7s across America, bringing rugby sevens to major venues that will act as regional hubs for the rugby community. “We believe the Bay Area, central Texas and the DMV [DC and parts of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia] will give our league a footprint for fans to easily witness the spectacle that is a PR7s live event. “Each city brings entertainment options that will complement the festival and party environment that is synonymous with the sport of sevens around the world.” Three Major League Soccer venues will host: PayPal Park (home of the San Jose Earthquakes, holding 18,000, on 9 July), Audi Field (DC United, 20,000, 16 July) and Q2 Stadium (Austin FC, 21,000, 30 July). Men and women will compete in 14-minute games under squad names unique to PR7s: Experts, Headliners, Loonies and Loggerheads. In Memphis last year, Perry Baker, an Olympian and two-time men’s world sevens player of the year, led the Experts to victory. Alev Kelter, an Olympian now playing in England with Saracens, led the Loonies to the women’s title. PR7s said a “cumulative audience” of 472,000 watched on Fox Sports and TSN. Ross Young, chief executive of sanctioning body USA Rugby, offered “a sincere congratulation to everyone at PR7s as they exponentially build on an impressive debut in 2021. “The line of events in 2022 truly amplifies the sevens season this summer and in three of the best rugby cities the United States has to offer. “With three-times the opportunity for current and aspiring Olympians to compete at a professional level, PR7s continues to present an invaluable platform for USA Rugby high-performance development and scouting.” Three players who played in Memphis subsequently made US Eagles debuts: Logan Tago, Aaron Cummings and Sarah Levy. The US sevens calendar is crowded, and PR7s will this year take place at a busy time in the amateur club calendar. In professional play, though, PR7s has set its stall out first. Its new events will follow the fifth season of Major League Rugby, the 15-a-side men’s pro competition. Sources within MLR said the league had no plan to launch its own sevens competition this year but could do so in future. Last December, another USA Rugby-sanctioned sevens venture said it would hold an event in Las Vegas in October 2022. An announcement said US Rugby Sevens Major League would see “the world’s best international men’s rugby sevens players compete against the best US players for record-breaking prize money of $1m”. The group behind the project, Rugby Football League (separate from the governing body of British rugby league, of the same name) also said that in 2023 it would stage 17 tournaments, featuring “up to 16 US team franchises playing with top international teams”. Little else has emerged. The US market remains a tantalising prize, coveted across the rugby world. In sevens, the US hosted the last World Cup, in San Francisco in 2018. In 15s, it is on track to be announced in May as the host of the 2031 men’s Rugby World Cup and the women’s event two years later.",Sport/Sport,"Premier Rugby Sevens announces events in California, DC and Texas",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/premier-rugby-sevens-california-washington-dc-texas-perry-baker-alev-kelter
3/31/2022,"Pakistan’s embattled prime minister Imran Khan is set to speak to the nation as he faces a no-confidence vote in parliament that could mean the end of his premiership. Khan was expected to make the address on Wednesday but was forced to postpone until Thursday after a vital coalition party joined the opposition, bringing an end to his majority in the parliament. The move from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement – Pakistan (MQM-P) puts the expected number of opposition votes against Khan at 177 – five more than the 172 that is needed in the 342-member national assembly to oust him. The vote of no confidence is expected to take place on Sunday or Monday, after a debate in parliament beginning on Thursday. The main opposition leaders, Shahbaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, asked Khan to resign before the vote since he had lost the majority, but as the political temperature is rising in Islamabad, the chances of him doing so are considered slim. The information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, on Wednesday tweeted: “Prime minister Imran Khan is a player who fights till the last ball. He will not resign.” Khan has been holding rallies of his supporters before the confidence vote. Speaking to thousands of his supporters in Pakistan’s capital on Sunday, Khan pulled a note from his waistcoat pocket and raised it in the air as “evidence” that a foreign conspiracy was under way in the country to oust him, saying local leaders were acting at the behest of foreign powers. Abdul Basit, a former diplomat, told local media the so-called threatening letter was a diplomatic assessment from Pakistan’s former US ambassador Asad Majeed Khan and not a threat from the US government. Khan has also threatened MPs with the wrath of the masses if they vote against him. Kanwar Naveed Jamil, the deputy convener of MQM-P, was harassed and called a traitor by Khan’s supporters in Islamabad international airport on Wednesday after his party parted its ways with the prime minister. Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar of the opposition Pakistan Peoples party (PPP), the third largest in parliament, said populist politicians around the globe had polarised societies and Khan was no exception. “Khan over the years has painted the opposition leaders and their parties as corrupt, traitors and labelled them as public enemies. He and his ministers have publicly threatened the dissidents within his own party of severe consequences for not choosing to side with his government in the vote of no confidence,” he said. “Now they have taken it a step further by harassing and assaulting a member of the former coalition partner who recently decided to part ways with Imran Khan’s government … We wish to see him booted out through democratic and parliamentary procedure of a no-confidence vote. Perhaps Imran Khan should sit back and reflect on his own performance in office rather than whipping up more hatred.”",News/World news,Imran Khan to address Pakistan as he faces no-confidence vote,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/imran-khan-address-pakistan-faces-no-confidence-vote
