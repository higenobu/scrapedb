4/12/2022,"A prominent Russian opposition activist and outspoken critic of the invasion of Ukraine has been detained in Moscow, his lawyer has told the independent news outlet Sota on Monday evening. Vladimir Kara-Murza, 40, is a veteran Kremlin critic who says he was deliberately poisoned in Moscow in 2015 and 2017 as retaliation for his lobbying efforts to impose US and EU sanctions against Russian officials accused of human rights abuses. A close friend of the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed in 2015, Kara-Murza nearly died from kidney failure in the first incident. His longtime lawyer Vadim Prokhorov said Kara-Murza had been arrested late on Monday on charges of disobeying police orders, and faces up to 15 days in jail or a small fine. It was not immediately clear if Kara-Murza’s arrest was linked to his opposition to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but it comes amid an unprecedented crackdown on independent media and anti-war dissent. Last month, the Russian parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. Kara-Murza, who studied at Cambridge university, has been a vocal opponent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, launching an anti-war committee with other Russian leading opposition figures. He has also been one of the few prominent opposition figures still living in Russia, as many have fled the country out of safety concerns after the jailing last year of Alexei Navalny. Aleksandr Podrabinek, a former Soviet dissident who came to the Khamovniki police station on Monday to support Kara-Murza, told Sota that he believed he had been detained because the authorities were “angered by his courage.” Hours prior to his detainment, Kara-Murza appeared on CNN where he described the Kremlin as a “regime of murderers.” “I have absolutely no doubt that the Putin regime will end over this war in Ukraine, doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen tomorrow. The two main questions are time and price and by price, I do not mean monetary – I mean the price of human blood and human lives and it has already been horrendous, but the Putin regime will end over this and there will be a democratic Russia after Putin,” Kara-Murza said.",News/World news,Prominent Russian opposition activist detained in Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/prominent-russian-opposition-activist-detained-in-moscow
4/12/2022,"Always, when a terrorist atrocity takes place, the questions are the same: how could this have happened? Could it have been prevented? The fact that we rarely get satisfactory answers does not stop us wondering. Footage from the inquiry into the attack outside an Ariana Grande concert in 2017, which heard its final submissions in March, provides many of the most arresting moments in Worlds Collide: The Manchester Bombing (ITV), a new two-part investigation. The actual inquiry spent more than six months sifting evidence; now, we at home have a couple of hours to come to our own personal ruling on whether the police and security services ought to have stopped Salman Abedi detonating a shrapnel bomb that killed him and 22 others. Whether or not this is a worthwhile pursuit is debatable, because even a well-made and intentioned documentary like this ends up feeling like a confusing spray of partial information. The opening episode’s effort to enlighten begins with the Abedi family’s arrival in Manchester in the late 1990s, as Libyan refugees. We are told how Salman was uninterested in school and then drawn, as too many disaffected British youths are, to gang crime, leaving his “little Tripoli” neighbourhood in Fallowfield behind to hang out on the streets of Moss Side. This criminal bent melded with Abedi’s religious beliefs to create a truly dangerous young man, we are told by a contributor – perhaps with not enough emphasis on how rare this behaviour is, and how starkly contradictory to the teachings of mainstream Islam. The turning point in the Abedi story is the Libyan civil war of 2011, which prompted many British Libyans to travel to Libya to join Islamist militias fighting against the Gaddafi dictatorship. Such groups were assisted by a Nato bombing campaign that Britain joined, a policy later criticised by the foreign affairs select committee as having led to “the growth of [Islamic State] in North Africa”. To what extent Abedi was one of our guys who turned on us is covered by the programme, but a single line from an interviewee about the dangers of British citizens going abroad, enlisting with extremist groups, then coming home again – the security services saw this risk but, well, that was the side we were on in the war – doesn’t feel like an adequate analysis of what is surely a key issue. There is a stronger examination of what came next, as British intelligence’s relationship with Abedi becomes what in hindsight is an agonising string of missed opportunities. Files were opened, then closed; interactions with possible terrorists were noted, but not acted on; intelligence that came in before the attack can now be seen as pointing to it, but was not identified as serious at the time. On the last point, Worlds Collide runs into a common problem for civilians trying to critique anti-terror measures: the content of that intelligence remains classified. But we are told that a meeting was scheduled for 31 May 2017 to discuss Abedi. He detonated his bomb on the concourse outside Manchester Arena on 22 May. Abedi committed his crime in an age of close surveillance, giving Worlds Collide a startlingly complete picture of his movements. It is deeply eerie to see CCTV film of him struggling into his block of flats with a heavy suitcase full of explosives, or conducting a reconnaissance trip at the site of the attack a few hours before the Grande gig. If the programme perhaps hunts for some painful ironies that aren’t there – of course nobody noticed a young man walking normally around a public space in the afternoon – it does identify people who must now live with what they didn’t do on that evening, when they saw Abedi on his return, weighed down by a heavy rucksack. They range from the apparently blameless, such as the suspicious event security worker who perhaps lacked enough relevant training, to the more culpable British Transport Police officers who were absent from their patrol for more than two hours because they had popped out to get a kebab. At times, Worlds Collide feels as if it trades on the frisson generated by near misses, tempted as it is by techniques that intensify our emotions. An on-screen clock ticks ominously towards zero, and the camera lingers on interviewees for two seconds after they’ve finished speaking, so we can see them reflect on the gravity of what they have said, or, in the case of grieving relatives offering a happy memory of the dead, wait for their smiles to fade. The gently sketched portraits of some of those who were murdered, their loved ones celebrating short lives so ordinary and so precious, do however constitute the best moments of Worlds Collide. They remind us of what was so shockingly lost, why we can’t help seeking a full explanation and why the programme should probably be forgiven for failing to provide one.",Arts/Television & radio,Worlds Collide: The Manchester Bombing review – an agonising string of missed opportunities,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/11/worlds-collide-the-manchester-bombing-review-an-agonising-string-of-missed-opportunities
4/12/2022,"Good morning. Putin meets Austria’s chancellor in his first face-to-face visit with a western leader since the invasion of Ukraine. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will be out campaigning in marginal seats, with jobs and healthcare on the election agenda. And Lonely Planet selects Australia’s top travel experiences. The last Ukrainian soldiers defending Mariupol said they were “running out of ammunition” on Monday and expected to be killed or taken prisoner very soon by Russian forces surrounding the city. Writing on Facebook, the 36th brigade said its 47-day defence of Mariupol was coming to a tragic conclusion. “We were bombed from airplanes and shot at by artillery and tanks. We have been doing everything possible and impossible,” it said. Meanwhile, Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said he told Vladimir Putin that “all those responsible” for war crimes must be brought to justice and warned that western sanctions would intensify as long as people kept dying in Ukraine. After becoming the first western leader to hold face-to-face talks with the Russian president since the invasion, Nehammer said his trip to Moscow was not “a visit of friendship” and that the two had had a “direct, open and hard” conversation. Scammers have allegedly fleeced at least $50,000 through cons related to devastating flooding across Australia’s east coast, with criminals impersonating charities, emergency services and government departments in dozens of frauds. New South Wales police have received multiple reports about scams they said were “unthinkable”, but no arrests have yet been made. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said at least 45 scam reports related to flooding had been lodged with its Scamwatch project in NSW and Queensland since 1 February. On the first official day of the 2022 election campaign, Labor leader Anthony Albanese stumbled over Australia’s jobless rate and the cash rate. There are other numbers politicians – and voters – should know and care about besides the price of a litre of milk or petrol, or a loaf of bread. Meanwhile, Liberal moderates have expressed concern that Scott Morrison has flagged committing during the election campaign to a ban on transgender women playing women’s sport. Peak legal organisations and trade unions have joined calls to reform aspects of Queensland’s anti-discrimination laws, including scrapping a clause used by some religious groups to justify contracts that suggest they could sack LGBTQ+ staff. Compared with most other countries, Australia was relatively unscathed by the pandemic, although its health results were achieved by severe measures. Scott Morrison said 40,000 lives had been saved. But how is this figure calculated, is it the whole story and who gets the credit for this boast? Councils across Sydney’s west say some parents are forced to send their children to private schools due to the New South Wales government’s failure to plan for population growth, warning that it is exacerbating educational disadvantage. Australia’s coming flu season is likely to be worse than in previous pandemic years, with experts warning against complacency around influenza vaccines. Choosing Australia’s top travel experiences is not easy, and while many usual suspects appear in Lonely Planet’s list, some may even surprise locals. Sweden’s ruling party has begun debating whether the country should join Nato, and neighbouring Finland expects to reach a decision within weeks, as Moscow warned that the Nordic nations’ accession would “not bring stability” to Europe. A prominent New Caledonian indigenous party has said that if France wants to have an economic and political stake in the Pacific – given China’s “omnipresence” in the region – it needs to grant New Caledonia a fourth referendum on independence and treat the Pacific island nation as a partner, rather than a colony. Six new alpine species of New Zealand’s most unusual and beloved insect – the wētā – have been discovered, but it is a bittersweet victory, with another piece of research describing the threat global heating poses for their snowy mountain habitat. The first all-women media house in Somalia has been launched, creating a rare opportunity for female journalists in the country to research and publish stories they want to tell. Johnny Depp has lost one high-profile defamation case involving his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in a London court. On Monday, the 58-year-old actor launched a sequel in Fairfax, Virginia, as part of an effort to refute career-damaging allegations that he abused Heard during their three-year marriage. Jodie Sharp’s days were all broken up the same way. “I smoked to go to work, smoked to do the washing-up, smoked for chill time.” Sharp used a little metal pipe, and she often ran her tongue over the hard skin on her lip where the pipe sat. Her lungs hurt, her gums bled. “I thought, ‘This is crazy. Why am I doing this at this time of my life?’” She was 60 years old and had been smoking marijuana for most of her adult life. But one day, waiting on the corner for her weekly £60 bag of weed, she saw herself from the outside, and felt “sick and tired” of what she saw. So she quit, and in time, began to dream again. The Australian government has been releasing refugees from its onshore detention over the past month, ending several years of detention for many, in a move shrouded in secrecy. Mehdi, an Iranian refugee who was detained on Nauru and in Australia from 2013 until last month, asks: how is it that some refugees have been detained long enough, while others even more vulnerable remain prisoners offshore? As Sydney’s “last, best” video shop closes, what’s the future for physical media in Australia, and for the communities who collect them? From the cancellation of performances of Tchaikovsky to the exit of Ikea and McDonald’s from Moscow, there has been a rush to boycott all things Russian. But what impact do these official and unofficial economic protests have?

4/12/2022,"Freddy Rincón, the former Colombia captain, is in a critical condition with severe head injuries after being involved in a car crash in the city of Cali. Four other people who were in the vehicle that Rincon was driving were also injured following the collision with a bus at around 4.30am. The bus driver was also hurt, according to local authorities who are reviewing CCTV footage of the accident. “Freddy Eusebio Rincón arrived in hospital this morning with a traumatic brain injury,” the Imbanaco Clinic said in a statement. “His condition is very critical.” Colombia’s football federation, the FCF, and his former club Real Madrid sent messages of support to the 55-year-old Rincón on social media. “The Colombian football federation send all their strength and support to former player Freddy Rincón,” a statement said. “We wish you a speedy recovery and that with God’s help you overcome this difficult situation.” “From Real Madrid, all of our strength and affection for Freddy Rincón following the accident he was involved in today,” read a statement from the Spanish club. “We send our encouragement and we hope that he overcomes this difficult moment as soon as possible.” Rincón was a key part of Colombia’s golden generation, who led the national side to three consecutive men’s World Cups in 1990, 1994 and 1998 alongside the likes of Carlos Valderrama and Faustino Asprilla. Rincón won 84 caps for his country, scoring 17 goals during his international career. The midfielder joined Real Madrid from Napoli in 1995 and spent two seasons at the Bernabéu before returning to South America with Palmeiras. He captained the Brazilian side Corinthians to the first club world championship title in 2000, and won national titles with both Brazilian sides, as well as América de Cali in Colombia. Rincón was involved in a serious car accident in 2013, when a truck he was driving overturned on a wet road between Cali and the city of Andalusia. He required surgery for multiple fractures and sustained a head wound in the accident.",Sport/Football,Former Colombia player Freddy Rincón in critical condition after car crash,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/freddy-rincon-colombia-real-madrid-player-car-crash
4/12/2022,"Since Florida passed its controversial “don’t say gay” bill, conservative states across America have been advancing similar bills as they attempt to ban the discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms. Last month, Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, signed into law the Parental Rights in Education bill. The law prohibits all discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, a move that advocates say will “erase” LGBTQ+ students and history. Since the bill’s introduction and passage, various Republican-run states have filed similar legislation that mimics Florida’s, reflecting a chilling wave of speech and identity restrictions across the country. Over 156 gag-order bills targeting issues of identity have been introduced or refiled in 39 states since January 2021, according to a February report by PEN America, a non-profit that seeks to protect freedom of expression in the US. At least 105 of those target K-12 schools, 49 target higher education and 62 include mandatory punishments for those found in violation. “Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill is just the tip of the iceberg. While race, sex and American history remain the most common targets of censorship, bills silencing speech about LGBTQ+ identities have also surged to the fore,” the organization said. In March, Georgia legislators introduced the Common Humanity in Private Education Act. According to the act, “No private or nonpublic school or program … shall promote, compel, or encourage classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not appropriate for the age and developmental stage of the student.” The act, which is sponsored by 10 Republican state senators, says “a focus on racial and gender identity and its resulting discrimination on the basis of color, race, ethnicity and national origin is destructive to the fabric of American society.” LGBTQ+ advocates in Georgia have pushed back heavily against the bill, arguing that it is not about parental rights but rather “restricting the activities, participation and learning” of children in schools. In Louisiana, a Republican state representative introduced a bill last month that seeks to ban discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in certain public school classrooms. The bill, proposed by representative Dodie Horton, seeks to prohibit “teachers and others from discussing their sexual orientation or gender identity with students” from kindergarten through 12th grade. It also seeks to also ban teachers and other presenters from discussing topics of sexual orientation and gender identity with students in kindergarten through eighth grade. In February, Republicans in Kansas introduced a state House bill that would make the depiction of homosexuality in classroom materials a class B misdemeanor. In Indiana, state legislators proposed a bill that would require schools to “obtain prior informed written consent from the parent of a student who is less than eighteen years of age … before the student may participate in any instruction on human sexuality.” The listed topics in the bill that would require parental consent includes abortion, birth control or contraceptives, sexual activity, sexual orientation, transgenderism and gender identity. Before obtaining written consent from parents, the bill would require schools to provide parents with “informed written notice which shall accurately describe in detail the contents and nature of the instruction on human sexuality, including the purpose of the instruction on human sexuality”. A bill introduced by Tennessee state Republicans in February seeks to prohibit any instructional materials that “promote, normalize, support, or address lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, or transgender issues or lifestyles”. In Arizona, proposed bills by Republican state senators include those that would block gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth, as well as force teachers, nurses and other school staff to disclose a minor’s gender identity to their parents. Oklahoma state legislators recently passed a bill that prevents students enrolled in colleges from being “required to engage in any form of mandatory gender or sexual diversity training or counseling; provided, voluntary counseling shall not be prohibited”. The law also states, “Any orientation or requirement that presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or a bias on the basis of race or sex shall be prohibited.” Earlier this week, Ohio Republican representatives Jean Schmidt and Mike Loychik introduced a bill that would ban kindergarten through third-grade classrooms from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity. Additionally, classrooms with older students would be disallowed from featuring those topics in ways that are “not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate”. In response to the bill’s introduction, Democratic representative Brigid Kelly called it a “huge problem} and said: “We’re not giving people access to the tools, the materials, the lessons they need to prepare children for the diverse world that exists.” Similarly, South Carolina state lawmakers introduced a bill that would ban state entities, including schools from subjecting students to “instruction, presentations, discussions, counseling, or materials in any medium” that involves topics including “sexual lifestyles, acts, or practices”, as well as “gender identity or lifestyles”. Additionally, like the Oklahoma law, another South Carolina bill seeks to prevent teachers, staff members and district employees from engaging in gender and sexual diversity training. In states such as Wisconsin and Rhode Island, personal pronouns have also become a contentious subject for conservative lawmakers. Both chambers of the Wisconsin legislature have approved a bill which has yet to be signed into law that includes a parent’s right to choose pronouns for their children. In Rhode Island, a proposed bill would require children to “be addressed by their common names and the pronouns associated with their biological gender” unless their parents grant permission to change them. “Florida’s cruel ‘don’t say gay’ bill is one of hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills moving through state legislatures, most of which primarily attack trans youth,” the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted in February. “Censoring classroom discussions won’t keep kids from being LGBTQ. It just piles on to the national pattern of attacks,” it added. This article was amended on 11 April 2022. An earlier version of the standfirst suggested all 156 bills in question related to LGBTQ+ issues.",News/US news,Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill inspired a chilling wave of Republican legislation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/11/republican-states-mimic-florida-dont-say-gay-bill
