4/26/2022,"The first body arrived in late February, a few days after the Russian invasion began. The next day, two more. By the beginning of March, the morgue, on the outskirts of Kyiv, had no more space for the dead who, every day, arrived by the dozen from the cities of Bucha and Borodyanka – at the time occupied by the Russian forces. When Moscow’s withdrawal from the areas north of the capital early in April unveiled the brutality of mass graves, with hundreds of civilian corpses buried in residential districts, every morgue in the Kyiv region was already at breaking point. Today, more than two months after the war began, bodies are being piled in refrigerated trucks in front of the morgues, as authorities struggle to handle the number of dead. “We weren’t prepared for this,” said a coroner from a village a few kilometres from the capital. “No one would ever have imagined that it would come to this.” Survivors of Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin and Hostomel, where Russians are accused of war crimes against civilians, did not stop to celebrate their liberation, starting immediately instead to count and identify their dead. Each day dozens of people now approach the refrigerated trucks to put the names of their loved ones to the bodies closed in black bags and piled one on top of the other. “Up to Sunday, 1,123 bodies were recovered in the Kyiv region alone, with 35 children among them,” said Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region. “These are the bodies that we have dug out from mass graves or that we have found on the streets. We have found brutalised people. All 1,123 cases are being documented and examined by detectives. And, every day, we continue to uncover more bodies. I can’t give any more precise information because there are thousands of reports being written.” Vladyslav Perovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who, with a team of coroners, has carried out dozens of autopsies on people from Bucha, Irpin and Borodyanka who died during Russia’s month-long occupation of the area, explains that the process of identifying corpses is very complex, given the state of decomposition of the bodies found in the mass graves and the high level of brutalisation perpetrated on the victims, even after they were killed. He tells of people killed and then crushed by tanks. “There are many burnt and disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify,” he said. “The face could be smashed into pieces. You can’t put it back together. Sometimes, there’s no head at all.” His team, which operates in a morgue that cannot be identified for security reasons, has been examining about 15 bodies a day, many of them mutilated. An elderly couple approaches the rear doors of the vehicle. Through tears, they communicate the identity of the victim to the men standing inside the trailer, in the midst of no less than 30 bodies. He was their son, who was serving in the civil resistance. The couple say he was allegedly betrayed by a woman when Russian soldiers occupied their town on the outskirts of the capital and were hunting down Ukrainian fighters and former soldiers who had taken part in the war in Donbas. Their son was one of them. The Russians captured him, tortured him, broke his arms and legs and put a plastic bag over his head. Then they shot him dead in the head and threw his body on the side of the road. His corpse remained there, for days, until it was found by volunteers. When the men inside the vehicle show her the slain body of her son, the woman bursts into inconsolable cries and screams, as she curses the Russian soldiers, wishing them the same fate. A tattoo on his shoulder is the only identifying sign on an almost completely unrecognisable body, marked by decomposition and brutalisation. When the woman sees it, she nods and is accompanied to the car, in tears. Before his body can be buried, however, it will first have to be examined by Perovskyi’s team, who, alongside 18 experts from the forensic department of France’s national gendarmerie, have started documenting the terror inflicted on civilians, during the month-long occupation. “We are seeing a lot of mutilated bodies,” said Perovskyi. “A lot of them had their hands tied behind their backs and shots in the back of their heads. There were also cases with automatic gunfire, like six to eight holes on the back of victims. And we have several cases of cluster bombs’ elements embedded in the bodies of the victims.” Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and western allegations of war crimes are concocted. Evidence of death and destruction in the areas occupied by Moscow’s troops seems to suggest otherwise.",News/World news, ‘We weren’t prepared for this’: Kyiv area morgues at breaking point,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/kyiv-area-morgues-ukrainian-coroners-war-casualties
4/26/2022,"A 72-year-old Italian woman has embarked on an epic journey between Venice and Beijing by foot, following the path of the legendary merchant Marco Polo along the ancient Silk Road trade route. Vienna Cammarota left Venice, birthplace of Polo, on Tuesday, and will cover a distance of about 13,670 miles (22,000km) as she walks through 15 countries, with the aim of arriving in Beijing in December 2025. Cammarota has been an avid walker for more than 30 years and previously ventured across Tibet, Palestine, Israel, Patagonia and Madagascar by foot. Her most recent adventure took her on a journey through medieval towns in the southern Italian regions of Campania, Calabria and Basilicata. Speaking before setting off, Cammarota said she was ready for her latest challenge, during which she will experience vastly contrasting terrain and climate on the route across countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. However, she is also a little nervous. “It’s always the same feeling at the beginning of a trip,” she said. Aside from her backpack, Cammarota is equipped with a GoPro camera to record footage of her travels and a phone that includes an app through which her doctor can check on her health remotely. “There will be really challenging moments, such as facing the cold in Mongolia, but I’m ready,” she added. Cammarota will cross into Slovenia from northern Italy, before heading to Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and, finally, China. By the time she reaches Beijing she will be 75. She hopes to be hosted by people she meets along the way. “Not because I’m trying to save money, but because I want to have direct contact and be able to tell the story of the countries through the people hosting me,” she said, adding that her family might join her if she stays in a place for longer than a day or two. Cammarota, who is an ambassador of Archeoclub Italia, an association for the preservation of cultural heritage, has been inspired to explore by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the German author who published diaries of his travels in Italy between 1786 and 1788 in his book, Italian Journey, and of course, by Marco Polo. Polo set off from Venice in 1271 at the age of 17 and spent more than two decades travelling through Asia on a route that later became known as the Silk Road. Probably the most famous European to travel the route, he wrote a book about his adventures that went on to become one of the world’s first bestsellers. “After Von Goethe, I became fascinated by Marco Polo,” said Cammarota. “I love history, culture and archaeology, and I walk in order to see and recount, but above all to listen.” Cammarota will be travelling with Italian and Ukrainian flags, describing the trip as “a walk for peace” as she endeavours to “unite populations”. “In all likelihood, the journey will cover a distance of about 22,000km, but I don’t exclude deviations to take into account the changes that may have occurred along the Silk Road.”",News/World news,72-year-old woman to walk Marco Polo’s path from Venice to Beijing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/72-year-old-woman-to-walk-marco-polos-path-from-venice-to-beijing
4/26/2022,"Viola Davis has responded to widespread criticism of her latest performance by stating that critics “serve no purpose”. The Oscar-winning actor has received negative feedback from both critics and on social media for playing Michelle Obama in Showtime series The First Lady. In an interview with the BBC, Davis called the response “incredibly hurtful”. “Critics absolutely serve no purpose,” she said. “And I’m not saying that to be nasty, either. They always feel like they’re telling you something that you don’t know. Somehow that you’re living a life that you’re surrounded by people who lie to you and ‘I’m going to be the person that leans in and tells you the truth’. So it gives them an opportunity to be cruel to you.” She said that playing someone as widely familiar as the former first lady was “almost impossible” and that “you’re doing too much or not enough”. The First Lady, which also stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Gillian Anderson, was seen by many as an awards play, released in the last period of Emmy contention, with the Washington Post’s Inkoo Kang criticising “Emmy-baiting performances”. Davis previously won an Emmy for her performance in ABC thriller series How to Get Away with Murder. The First Lady has received a 42% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the Guardian’s Adrian Horton noting “cringeworthy dialogue, scrambled pacing and parody-level performances” and Variety’s Caroline Framke writing that the actors “struggle to bring their characters to believable life”. “How do you move on from the hurt, from failure?” she said of the bad reviews. “But you have to. Not everything is going to be an awards-worthy performance.” Davis won a best supporting actor Oscar for her performance in August Wilson adaptation Fences and was nominated for roles in Doubt, The Help and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. She will next be seen in action biopic The Woman King, a film she has referred to as her “magnum opus”. “Ultimately I feel like it is my job as a leader to make bold choices,” she said. “Win or fail, it is my duty to do that.”",Arts/Film,Viola Davis says ‘critics absolutely serve no purpose’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/26/viola-davis-michelle-obama-showtime-the-first-lady
4/26/2022,"Life for LGBT+ young people in Scotland is “worse now than it has been for a long time”, according to a report which highlights growing concerns about homophobia in public spaces, bullying in schools and transphobic media coverage. The five-yearly report from the campaigning and advocacy group LGBT Youth Scotland found a sharp decrease in respondents who believe that Scotland is a good place for LGBTI young people to live, falling from 81% in 2017 to 65% in 2022 and the first drop in the figure for 15 years. There was also a significant increase in those who believe that homophobia and transphobia is a “big problem” in Scotland since the last survey was undertaken in 2017 – rising from 11% to 25% and 49% to 69% respectively. The Life in Scotland report, first developed in 2007 and funded by the Scottish government, offers a snapshot of how young LGBT+ Scots experience a range of issues and services, and this year showed an especially strong representation of participants who identify as transgender. Advertised via social media, with information packs distributed to schools, colleges and universities, the survey generating 1,279 full responses. The ages of respondents ranged from 13 to 25 and of the total, 35% identified as gay or lesbian, 31% as bisexual and 19% queer. In addition, 49% of total respondents identified as transgender, with 30% who identified as non-binary included in this figure. The majority (82%) were in secondary or further education, with a quarter living in rural areas, a quarter in cities and half in suburban areas. According to the report, LGBT-related bullying is also on the rise, especially in schools, while the number of participants who said they had left education as a result had increased from 9% in 2017 to 13%. Although nearly half of transgender participants reported that they had experienced a hate crime or incident, along with a quarter of cisgender participants, only 11% alerted police, and there was steep decline in those who said they would feel confident reporting hate crime: from 54% of all participants in 2012 to 17% in 2022. For the first time this year, the survey included a question on trans healthcare, with 63% who have accessed a gender identity clinic reporting that they felt supported and respected by the service. Respondents were also highly critical of mainstream media and suspicious of “pink-washing”, the tokenistic use of the rainbow flag to boost a company’s sales or reputation. But political engagement remained extremely high: 94% of those eligible to vote said they did so. Presenting the results, Dr Kathleen Cronie, research officer for LGBT Youth Scotland, said: “Responses indicate that homophobia and transphobia are on the rise and that biphobia remains a problem, for example with couples holding hands in public attracting stares and comments, feeling unsafe in public areas like public transport, and the difficulty faced in navigating a complex online environment. “Participants said this was made worse by media outlets that failed to reflect accurately the lives of queer people and in some cases spread misinformation, in particular around transgender identity.” The report comes as the Holyrood parliament considers draft legislation to streamline the Gender Recognition Act and diverges from Westminster in plans to introduce a full ban on conversion practices that includes transgender people.",News/World news,"Life in Scotland is getting worse, say young LGBT+ people",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/young-lgbt-people-scotland-bullying-worse-homophobia
4/26/2022,"What are the best spring vegetarian pasta dishes? Please don’t say pesto!David, Bristol Happily for you, David, vegetarian pastas really come into their own at this time of year. “All the beautiful greens, like asparagus and peas, are coming out,” enthuses Simona Di Dio, chef/co-owner at Bottega Caruso in Margate, who suggests giving peas a chance with her favourite dish from childhood: “It’s super-simple, but very comforting,” she says – which is good news for when the weather misses the spring memo. Fry sliced onion in an abundance of good extra-virgin olive oil (“I’m quite generous when there aren’t many ingredients”) and, once they’re sizzling, add fresh mint and a handful of peas per person. “Add about a finger of boiling water [from the kettle], a little tomato sauce, and salt and pepper, then put on the lid and cook until the peas are tender.” The dish hinges on a flavoursome broth, so make sure you season it well, adding a little dried chilli, too, if you fancy. Meanwhile, get the pasta (“ideally ditalini, the small rounds”) on to boil, then transfer to the pea pan with a slotted spoon. “Let it all come together, and serve with lots of fresh mint and parmesan or pecorino [if you eat them].” This plateful, however, is equally good without cheese. Chris Leach, chef/co-owner of Manteca in London, meanwhile, rounds up a menagerie of spring veg for his ragù-style pasta. “Gently cook a couple of crushed cloves of garlic in olive oil, then throw in peas, broad beans, chopped courgettes and asparagus, and cook quite quickly, maybe adding a splash of water.” Toss through long pasta such as spaghetti or tonnarelli (“a square spaghetti traditional to Lazio”), if you can get your hands on some, and finish with lemon juice and mint. “Some chopped wild garlic would be delicious in there, too,” Leach says, though if you go down that route, maybe omit or reduce the amount of garlic at the start. “Courgette and egg is a lovely one for spring,” says Guardian columnist Rachel Roddy, who recommends making the courgette mimic the pasta. “So, if you’re doing short tubes, dice or cut it into little quarter-moons; and for spaghetti, slice the courgette really thinly.” Veg prepped, Roddy warms olive oil in a pan then cooks thinly sliced onion and the courgette until very soft. Get your chosen pasta into salted boiling water, then, in a bowl whisk a couple of eggs and egg yolks, parmesan, a little salt and lots of black pepper. Transfer the cooked pasta to the courgette pan and, very quickly, add the egg mixture and a little of the pasta cooking water to loosen, then stir and toss so everything gets coated in the creamy, emulsified sauce (add more pasta water if it feels a bit stiff). “I also make a lot of spring bakes,” Roddy adds. “Braise some vegetables – courgettes or peas, say – par-cook big pasta shells, and maybe make some bechamel or use lengthened ricotta. Layer it all up, put it in the oven and finish off there.” Minestrone is another Roddy go-to at this time of year. She often adds a handful of pasta for the last 10 minutes of cooking, while cubes of bread fried in butter make a fine topping. A dollop or two of, ahem, pesto would be even better *ducks*.

4/26/2022,"Welcome back Donald Trump, Katie Hopkins, David Icke and Alex Jones? These are just some of the Twitter accounts that could be reinstated if the platform’s new owner-in-waiting, “free speech absolutist” Elon Musk, practices what he preaches. All of those accounts have been permanently suspended from the platform for infractions that include, most notoriously, the former US president’s alleged support for the Capitol riot on 6 January last year. Their reinstatement now appears to be back in play given that the world’s richest man has agreed a $44bn (£35bn) takeover of the platform that banned them and has stated that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy”. Trump said on Monday he has no intention of rejoining Twitter and is sticking with his rival TRUTH Social network, but Musk may give him an opportunity to recover his more than 88 million followers. Speaking at a TED conference this month, Musk said he was was “very cautious with permanent bans” and would prefer a timeout system for account holders who break Twitter’s conduct guidelines. Given that Hopkins, a British rightwing commentator, was permanently suspended for breaching the site’s “hateful conduct” policy, her readmission would immediately lessen the stringency of rules in place to prevent threats against people on the basis of “race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease”. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a US and UK-based non-profit organisation, says reinstating accounts banned for serious breaches would be a mistake. “If they have been banned for serial breaches the only way Musk can reinstate them is to say the rules don’t exist any more, which would show an appalling lack of judgment.” At the same conference, Musk also said people should be able to speak freely “within the bounds of the law” and Twitter should follow the laws of the countries in which it operates. Regardless of changes to the site’s suspension guidelines, it is hard to imagine historic tweets by Hopkins, whose posts have included comparing migrants to cockroaches, sailing past legislation like the UK’s upcoming online safety bill, which will require social media platforms to protect their users from harmful content. William Perrin, a policy expert whose work has influenced the regulatory framework behind the British bill, says Musk needs to adjust his approach. “A lot of American executives have thought the world operates like America and it does not,” he says. “Western Europe has the European convention on human rights which focuses on a balance between rights and is very different to the first amendment … The UK regime is designed to protect people from harm online and that’s something Musk will have to comply with.” However, Silkie Carlo, the director of UK privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, says the online safety bill is a censor’s charter because it will give the government the power to set boundaries of acceptable speech online by regulating posts deemed “legal but harmful”. “Billionaires’ ownership of the online public square is not a new development but it does bring into focus the need to empower citizens and ensure that rights are protected online,” she says. “Unfortunately, the UK government is taking us in the opposite direction with the online safety bill, which will place more power in the hands of a small number of people to police our online conversations.” In the European Union, the 27 member countries are implementing the Digital Services Act, which requires the likes of Twitter and Facebook to do more to tackle illegal content or face multibillion-euro fines. Progress in the US is slower, in part due to the first amendment protecting free speech, although there are attempts within Congress to introduce internet safety legislation. Rebecca Allensworth, the professor of law at Vanderbilt University in the US, says the first amendment will protect Twitter and Musk against any pressure on moderation policies. “American free speech law is essentially just the first amendment, which only constrains government actors, not a company like Twitter or a person like Elon Musk. In fact, Twitter itself (and Musk) probably enjoy at least some first amendment rights against the government meddling in moderation and deplatforming choices.” Nonetheless, perhaps the most consequential recent comment by Musk will be the reference to operating within the bounds of the law. Commercial interests could also represent a constraint for Musk. He has broached removing advertising on Twitter’s premium service, Blue, but ads account for 90% of Twitter’s $5bn in annual revenue. He will need cashflow to service the debt on a $46.5bn funding package and if advertisers are going to help out, they will want a positive platform. “For our client brands, it is extremely important to maintain a positive sentiment. No brand wants to be associated with hate, bullying or negative sentiments,” says Farhad Divecha, managing director of UK digital marketing agency Accuracast. “It is worrying that Twitter could become a free for all … If we find that user content moderation on the platform gets worse, there’s a very good chance we’d advise our clients not to advertise on Twitter.”",News/Business,Could Elon Musk’s Twitter welcome back Donald Trump and Katie Hopkins?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/elon-musk-twitter-donald-trump-katie-hopkins
4/26/2022,"Heating bill increases of up to 150% will lead to the widespread closures of UK swimming pools without an emergency government bailout, ministers have been told. Campaigners say that even if financial help is provided, swimmers will have to accept colder pools and higher prices. The sport governing body Swim England and ukactive, which represents gym and pool operators, met the sports minister Nigel Huddleston on Tuesday to make an urgent plea for emergency funds to keep pools open. Speaking before the meeting, the Swim England chief executive, Jane Nickerson, said: “We need some acute support now. At the moment swimming is not viable unless it’s supported. Our real worry is that doors will just shut because operators will find they can’t afford to run their pools. We need a bailout now because you can’t suddenly make a pool energy efficient.” The chief executive of ukactive, Huw Edwards, agreed. He said: “Fitness and leisure operators are reaching tipping point as rising energy costs bite, forcing them to consider price rises, service restrictions or permanent closure. Pool operators, in particular, are facing huge bills, with hundreds of facilities across the country just months away from closures and service restrictions.” The fear of widespread closures comes after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who is building a private pool in his North Yorkshire mansion, rejected calls for a long-term strategy to keep pools open as part of his spring statement. Nickerson said public pools were struggling to cope with a total energy bill of £1.25bn this year compared with £500m in 2019, at a time when the sector was still reeling from forced pool closures during lockdown. “Providers have run their reserves down to cope with the pandemic,” she said. One of the biggest public pool operators, GLL, which trades under the name Better, says its energy bills have increased by at least 150% since April 2019. Its chief executive, Mark Sesnan, who attended Tuesday’s meeting, said: “We are heading for a crisis and it needs urgent action. The minister went away with a clear message that we need something to be done. Although he was clear that he would struggle to make a special case to the Treasury.” Sesnan added: “People need to realise that this is a real and present danger to swimming in the UK. And it will be very difficult to maintain the current stock of pools. The business model has been completely disrupted. Just to meet the energy price increase we need an extra £1 for every person who uses a pool.” He said the public would also need to accept “more realistic” prices of about £7 or £8 a swim, as well as reduced opening hours and more stringent temperature controls to save on heating bills. Nickerson said: “Letting people swim in wetsuits is fine for someone like me doing lengths, because I can swim fast to keep warm. But you can’t teach children to swim in cold water – parents won’t take their kids if they see their teeth chattering.” She added: “If you shut the doors on these pools now you are losing out on kids learning to swim. You won’t die if you don’t learn to kick a football, but you can certainly drown if you don’t learn to swim.” She is also worried that price rises could make swimming unaffordable for many families. Nickerson said: “We don’t want public pools to become like private health clubs. It should be an activity for everyone, not just for those who can afford it.” Edwards pointed out the wider health benefits of swimming. He said: “More than 1 million children missed out on swimming lessons during the pandemic and many people’s physical and mental health deteriorated without access to pools and gyms. We need the government to act with urgency to support pools and gyms so that our nation’s health inequalities do not widen any further.” Pool closures, or threatened closures, have already been reported, including in Halifax, Newport, Shropshire, Falmouth, Croydon and Keswick. Even before the increase in fuel prices, a report by Swim England last September estimated that 40%, or 1,868, of the 4,336 public pools in England could be forced to close by 2030. Nickerson said: “There was a massive building programme in the 1960s and 70s but those pools have come to the end of their lifespan.” She said the energy crisis had increased the urgency of replacing those inefficient buildings. “The sector is looking at what it can do to save energy and retrofit buildings. But that won’t happen overnight. And they will also need grants to do it because the payback period is so long,” she said. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been approached for comment.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Swimming pools in UK will close without energy bailout, ministers told",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/26/swimming-pools-in-uk-will-close-without-energy-bailout-ministers-told
4/26/2022,"At 88, with almost seven decades of character comedy behind him, “the one character I’ve never fully explored is myself,” says Barry Humphries. With his new touring show, he makes a “stumbling attempt” to do so. The Man Behind the Mask doesn’t dig deeply under the skin of the creator of Dame Edna Everage and the sozzled Les Patterson, both of whom cameo in the show. Nor does it greatly deviate from the template for national-treasure celebs cosily recounting their life stories on stage. One might have wished for more iconoclasm from this great professional gadfly. But at the tail end of an extraordinary career, which spanned several eras and co-starred everyone who’s anyone in 20th century entertainment, who would deny Humphries a bask in nostalgia’s fireside glow? The impish spirit is still in evidence: Humphries is ever-ready to send up his self-indulgence with a cutting quip, as when he promises us another farewell show next year. In the meantime, this one offers us a slideshow of Humphries’ colonial youth: the architectural styles of 1930s Melbourne; his experiences of bullying and being bullied; and his early stage roles in Shakespeare and Noël Coward. The anecdotes feel arbitrary and are sometimes underpowered. But Humphries is jolly about the meandering nature of proceedings, reassuring his audience with a twinkle that “I wouldn’t insult you with a rehearsed show!” By the interval, we’ve reached the birth of Dame Edna, formerly Mrs Norm Everage, inspired partly by Humphries’ mum (“a mistress of the vocabulary of discouragement”), and partly by the provincial mayoresses he encounters on a theatre tour. Edna comes to dominate by act two, with screened footage of her starry career, including a prophetic interview with the insufferable young Boris Johnson. These clips are more electrifying than anything that’s happening on stage, but the live show remains gently compelling, as Humphries recounts his decade lost to alcoholism and pays touching tribute to Edna’s silent sidekick Emily Perry, AKA Madge Allsop. It’s an elegiac evening, finally, offset – occasionally, and to droll effect – by the incorrigible instincts of a career provocateur.

4/26/2022,"Three members of Insulate Britain have disrupted a magistrates court trial, gluing their hands to court furniture and paying tribute to the environmental activist who died after setting himself on fire outside the US supreme court. Dr Diana Warner, a retired GP from Bristol, had been due to face trial at Stratford magistrates court on a charge of causing a public nuisance by obstructing junction 14 of the M25 on 27 September last year. But when she entered the dock, fellow Insulate Britain members Liam Norton and Ana Heyatawin followed her into the court, began filming and broadcasting with their phones, and glued themselves to the furniture. Warner said: “Just a few days ago someone called Wynn Bruce self-immolated. He set fire to himself because the power that be are not paying attention to the climate.” Supergluing her hand to the glass of the dock, and ignoring orders from the judge to identify herself, Warner went on: “I just want to say this first and pay tribute to Wynn Bruce and to Angus Rose, who was on hunger strike for 37 days outside our parliament. “We are in dire straits. We are fighting for our children’s lives, for our grandchildren’s future and we should not be here. We need the courts to properly take charge of the law and human rights law, even the human right to life is at risk.” Norton attempted to reach the judge’s bench at the front of the court, but was wrestled to the floor when he tried to superglue his hand there. Heyatawin was able to glue herself to a solicitors bench close to the dock and held her phone aloft. She said: “We are not criminals. We have been brought here because we asked for insulation for our damp flats. We are not criminals … We are here being charged for asking for insulation for Britain’s social housing. I have been in prison for three months, I have been fined £5,000, I have now had to come back to court. “This is not protest, this is civil resistance.” Five police officers were brought into the court and the room was cleared. Last autumn, Insulate Britain made nationwide headlines for a series of road blockade protests on the M25 and other major roads in London and the south-east of England. They vowed to continue their protests until the government agreed to a national programme for insulating all Britain’s homes by 2030, beginning with social housing. Heyatawin and Norton had been due to appear later in the same court facing the same charges. A number of other Insulate Britain members’ cases had been heard earlier. They had elected for their cases to be heard at crown court, where a verdict would be reached by a jury but the potential penalties on conviction can be much higher. Before entering court on Tuesday, Warner, who has been to jail four times since 2020, had told the Guardian: “It’s just felt like a yo-yo, being inside and outside of prison. I’ve been much less at home than I have been in court or on the road.

4/26/2022,"The Brooklyn Nets began this season as many experts’ favorites to reach the NBA finals from the Eastern Conference. Instead, they were swept by the Boston Celtics in the first-round of the playoffs. All that’s left now is to try to figure out what went wrong in Brooklyn. The Nets began this season with a Big Three: a theoretically healthy Kevin Durant, a theoretically on-the-court Kyrie Irving and a one-time NBA MVP in James Harden, who was acquired the previous January in a trade with the Houston Rockets. It was a high-risk move to bring these talented veterans together, given that they had all fallen out with their previous franchises. To nobody’s shock, the trio didn’t last, and it was Harden who left. With their options limited in getting a potential impact All-Star in a Harden deal, they arranged a malcontent swap with the Philadelphia 76ers, which brought them back tremendously gifted, defense-first big man Ben Simmons. The Nets’ gamble was based upon the idea that Simmons was only holding out from playing because his relationship with the Sixers had disintegrated after his infamous offensive collapse during last year’s playoffs. As it turns out, it was more than that: Simmons’s absence was due to both physical and mental health issues that ultimately prevented him from playing a single minute in Brooklyn this season. Yes, in the long run, the Nets may have something in the Simmons acquisition. With that said, being forced to make the Harden deal and settling with this particular return hurt Brooklyn’s chances of success this year. The main reason Harden was fed up with his situation in Brooklyn? Well, it couldn’t help that he was dealing with the endless circus that was Irving’s battle with the City of New York. It turns out that New York’s Covid-19 restrictions meant that unvaccinated players couldn’t play home games at Barclays Center, making it impossible for Irving to play in Brooklyn for much of the regular season. During many crucial games, Irving was a spectator. Kyrie Irving: ""I feel like I was letting the team down when I wasn't able to play... It became a distraction at times."" Plenty of other players – despite their personal beliefs – would have simply gotten the vaccine, especially when it was hurting their team’s chances of winning a championship. After all, an engaged Irving is one of the most dangerous players in the entire league. Irving, for his own reasons, refused to make any such sacrifice for his teammates. If you’re wondering if this could have been the reason that Harden eventually forced his way out of town, well that’s the conventional wisdom although there’s never been on-the-record confirmation from Harden himself. One man who does think the issue affected the season though is, well, Kyrie Irving. “I think [my vaccine status] became a distraction at times,” said the point guard after Monday’s loss to the Celtics. “And as you see we just had some drastic changes.” So the Nets were without Irving for many games, Harden was in Philadelphia and Simmons was on the bench. It was all up to Durant to help shoulder a large share of the team’s burdens. Unfortunately, Durant suffered an MCL injury on 15 January and was missing for over a month and a half (KD was not the only Nets player to miss time, Joe Harris’s season was ruined by an ankle injury). When Durant returned, he was pressed into service to drag the Nets into a seventh-place finish that required them to win a play-in game just to make the playoffs. By the time the playoffs started, Durant was starting to feel the effects of the heavy minutes he was playing near the end of the regular season. That’s not a complete excuse for his early struggles against Boston – especially since the Celtics were missing starting center Robert Williams for the first two games of the series – but it couldn’t have helped. He managed 39 points, nine assists and seven rebounds in Game 4, but by that point he was running on empty. Steve Nash Sunday was talking about fatigue, and specifically Kevin Durant's workload since coming back.Made me wonder about the NBA leaders in minutes played over the last month (Regular Season/Play-in/Playoff).Go figure.(Durant's gone over 40 minutes in 9 of his last 10.) pic.twitter.com/281qCP3xeo The Nets have a habit of hiring mascots rather than head coaches: let’s not forget that they brought in Jason Kidd just the season after he retired as a player. So, it wasn’t shocking that they handed Hall of Famer Steve Nash the keys to the team in September 2020 even though he had never even been an NBA assistant coach before. Nets players were supportive of Nash on Monday night after their season ended but at times during this sweep, Nash looked more like a babysitter than a coach. With his team down 2-0 and facing a crucial Game 3, Nash seemed allergic to calling timeouts and designing plays, hoping that his vets would stumble into the right course of action on their own. They mostly did not. Upon Nash’s hiring, Irving famously responded to the news with a blithe, “I don’t really see us having a ‘head’ coach.” Maybe not the most polite statement in the world, but Nash did little to prove his point guard wrong during this postseason. Still, it’s hard to know what Nash could have done given how thoroughly the Celtics outplayed his team. While the dysfunction in Brooklyn has captured the headlines, Boston should have been favored from the start. After stumbling through the first half of the season with first-time head coach Ime Udoka still learning on the job after an impressive internship under Gregg Popovich at the San Antonio Spurs and Nash himself with the Nets, the team got healthy, Udoka came into his own and the Celtics finally found their identity. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown learned to play with each other again. Upon being elevated to the starting point guard position, Marcus Smart emerged as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year … and the rest of his team weren’t far behind. The Celtics were the best defensive team in the league in the regular season’s second half, and no slouches on the offensive end either. Given the chance to tank in the final game of the season and avoid facing Durant and Irving in the first round of the playoffs, the Celtics played at full strength against a Memphis Grizzlies B-squad to grab the East’s second seed. They took on the challenge because they knew that they could beat the Nets on their own terms. By betting on themselves, the Celtics not only avenged their loss to the Nets in last year’s playoffs, but they may also have sent Brooklyn’s entire organization back to the drawing board.",Sport/Sport,From superteam to superflops: who is to blame for the Nets’ playoff humbling?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/brooklyn-nets-loss-boston-celtics-nba-playoffs-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving
