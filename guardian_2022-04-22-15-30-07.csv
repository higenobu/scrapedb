4/22/2022,"Transparency experts have criticised as “absolute rubbish” Scott Morrison’s claims that the resignations of New South Wales Liberal premiers Nick Greiner and Barry O’Farrell show the Independent Commission Against Corruption is a “kangaroo court”. On the defensive after effectively ditching his commitment to create a federal anti-corruption body, Morrison complained on Friday that the NSW Icac had resulted in politicians quitting “too many times”. Morrison is a longstanding critic of Icac’s investigation into the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian’s secret relationship with MP Daryl Maguire and her alleged failure to declare a conflict while involved in grants for his electorate of Wagga Wagga. Berejiklian has denied any wrongdoing and Icac is yet to hand down its findings. On Friday Morrison said the Coalition’s proposed commonwealth integrity commission “isn’t a process of trying people … in the media that we’ve seen through the Icac process”. “It doesn’t get into salacious public hearings about who’s people’s boyfriends are and runs people out of jobs, runs people out of jobs before the commission has even finalised their review,” he told Sky News. Morrison accused the Icac of “quite disgracefully” airing Berejiklian’s relationship in public, prompting her resignation. “I mean, the same thing happened with Barry O’Farrell … The same thing happened to Nick Greiner. We’ve seen it too many times. These matters should be done in a proper legal process. “Where people’s, all rights are respected … And that’s the sort of serious model that I want. I don’t want a show trial. I don’t want a kangaroo court.” Greiner, who set up the NSW Icac, resigned in 1992 over an adverse finding from an investigation into allegations that he had misused his position to secure an independent MP’s resignation for political advantage. Icac’s adverse finding against Greiner was later overturned on appeal, and he has since publicly defended the Icac from its detractors. O’Farrell was not the subject of Icac investigation, but resigned in 2014 after he told the Icac, while appearing as a witness into an investigation into Australian Water Holdings’ efforts to secure a lucrative government deal, that he did not receive a bottle of 1959 Penfolds Grange. The next day O’Farrell revealed he had been made aware of a thank you note for the wine, acknowledging the error in his evidence although insisting he had no recollection of receiving it. O’Farrell appeared again before Icac to correct his evidence and apologise. Icac cleared him of any wrongdoing, finding that “that there was no intention on Mr O’Farrell’s part to mislead”. Stephen Charles, a former judge of the Victorian court of appeal and board member of the Centre for Public Integrity, told Guardian Australia Morrison’s comments about NSW Icac were “ridiculous”. Charles said O’Farrell “would still be premier” if he hadn’t resigned, as “nobody was making any allegation of corruption” against him. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It has had no effect on his reputation, he is now Australia’s high commissioner to India. His embarrassment was understandable, but he should have apologised, and that would’ve been the end of it.” Charles said Greiner had also resigned “voluntarily” and could also have “saved” his position by waiting for the court of appeal decision. He said it was ludicrous of Morrison to refuse to introduce his integrity commission bill unless Labor supports it. “Never before have I heard someone in government say they would not carry out an election commitment because the opposition opposed it. It’s fatuous nonsense.” Barrister Geoffrey Watson, counsel assisting the NSW Icac at the time of O’Farrell’s resignation, said Morrison’s comments were “absolute rubbish”. “Mr O’Farrell gave evidence to Icac that was wrong. He wasn’t asked to resign, he did it of his own accord,” Watson said. “I was there that day – I still have no idea why, if it was an innocent error, he resigned. Icac didn’t do that to him, he did that to himself.” Berejiklian has consistently denied she acted improperly during her relationship with Maguire, but resigned in October claiming she had “no choice” after the Icac revealed it was investigating whether she had been involved in “a breach of public trust” between 2012 and 2018 because of her relationship with Maguire. Watson said people were “entitled to have some misgivings” about Berejiklian’s failure to declare the relationship at cabinet level, citing former premier Mike Baird’s evidence that he was “incredulous” after learning about the relationship. “Morrison is starting to sound desperate with these childish attacks, which are not based in fact,” he said. Labor has committed to introducing a national anti-corruption commission by the end of 2022, if elected.",News/Australia news,"Scott Morrison’s Icac claims are ‘absolute rubbish’, say transparency experts",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/scott-morrisons-icac-claims-are-absolute-rubbish-say-transparency-experts
4/22/2022,"Westpac has been fined $40m for charging fees to more than 11,800 dead people, bringing the total the federal court has ordered the bank to pay in a string of misconduct cases brought by the corporate regulator to $130m. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission launched the six cases against Westpac in November, accusing the bank of charging financial advice service fees to the dead, double-charging for insurance, collecting and paying illegal commissions, failing to properly disclose fees, allowing company accounts that should have been closed to stay open and selling personal debts to collectors at an interest rate higher than allowed. Westpac admitted to the allegations, which affected 70,000 customers, and agreed to pay more than $80m in remediation. The cases have been heard over the past month by a federal court justice, Jonathan Beach. On Friday, he handed down judgment in the case of the fees from dead people – the last case to be heard – and ordered Westpac to pay Asic $40m. Westpac “utterly failed to address the issues systematically”, the judge said. He has previously ordered Westpac to pay $15m for double charging 7,000 customers for insurance; $6m for failing to disclose financial service fees to 25,000 customers; $20m for allowing 21,000 accounts belonging to deregistered companies and holding $120m to remain open and charging fees on them; $12m for selling the debt of 16,000 customers, including some who were financially vulnerable, to collectors at a higher rate than allowed; and $20m for charging commissions to more than 9,900 customers of subsidiary BT, even though such payments were banned in 2012. “The breaches found by the court in these six cases demonstrate a profound failure by Westpac over many years and across many areas of its business to implement appropriate systems and processes to ensure its customers were treated fairly,” Asic’s deputy chair, Sarah Court, said. “Westpac, like all licensees, has an obligation to be honest and fair in its provision of financial services. Despite this, Westpac failed to prioritise and fund the systems upgrades necessary to help fulfil this obligation. “The sheer scale of this impact suggests that, at the time, Westpac had a culture that did not prioritise compliance.” Court said many of Westpac’s breaches of the law – including charging fees to the dead – continued even after the financial services royal commission in 2018 “gave prominence to many of these issues across the banking industry and saw law reforms introduced to prevent harm”. “Consumer harm caused by systems failures is unacceptable,” she said. “Financial institutions must invest in systems that allow them to meet their obligations to customers. Asic expects the industry to do this work quickly and efficiently.”",News/Australia news,Westpac fined $40m for charging fees to the dead,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/westpac-fined-40m-for-charging-fees-to-the-dead
4/22/2022,"“This is the west sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” The famous line uttered by a newspaperman in John Ford’s masterpiece The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance symbolizes the mythological west that he and his most famous collaborator, John Wayne popularized. At 60 years old, it is the greatest western of Hollywood’s Golden Age, even usurping Ford’s own The Searchers that has always clambered its way near the top of greatest film lists. The story focuses on Ransome Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart), an American senator arriving at the town of Shinbone with his wife, Hailey (Vera Miles), to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (Wayne). Through flashback, Stoddard tells his story to the press of first coming to the town as a young law graduate. The townsfolk are terrorised by gang leader Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin in a career-best role). Valance works for the local cattle barons, who are fighting the territory’s right to statehood. Doniphon is the only one who can stand up to Valance, but Stoddard believes that legal justice can prevail against him. In between that, there is a love triangle between Stoddard, Hailey and Doniphon. And then there is the question: who was the man who would eventually shoot Liberty Valance? Ford’s vision of the west has become synonymous with how audiences perceive it. It’s almost impossible not to think of the American frontier without John Wayne framed against Monument Valley’s harsh terrain. Scorsese called the director the “essence of classic American cinema”. Orson Welles watched Ford’s Stagecoach 40 times to understand how to direct his first movie (that film being Citizen Kane). But much of Ford’s influence has been lost on contemporary moviegoers. Though he created the romantic notion of the west, aspects of his work have come under scrutiny. In particular, his depiction of Native Americans as often faceless cannon fodder for Wayne’s rifle. Even The Searchers has been endlessly debated by critics whether the director endorsed or condemned the protagonist’s racist actions. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is not a film about American heroes but about the country itself. Ford brilliantly captures this through the personas of its two leading actors that were cultivated over the preceding decades. He’s self-critical of both his own legacy as a film-maker and the country that he helped mythologize. If The Great Gatsby is the great American novel, then this is the great American film. Since the 1930s, Stewart always represented the good-natured raconteur who stood up against corporations and bullies. He was not an intimidating figure but always prevailed against injustice and rarely relied on violence as his key method to victory. “No one fights my battles,” Stoddard exclaims angrily to Doniphon. He never wants to use violence as the method to take down Valance (“I don’t want to kill him; I want to put him in jail”). Even when he played darker roles like in Vertigo, Stewart was always intensely likable. However, Ford is critical about whether such a law-abiding citizen can really succeed in America. By the end, Stoddard still detests violence, but to achieve liberty, he must shoot Liberty. In America, violence will always take precedence over language. “What’s reading and writing ever done you,” Hailey exclaims to Stoddard. Conversely, Wayne’s persona consisted of action, often involving the draw of a pistol to solve his problems. Though he spoke with a long drawl, his words were as violent as the bullets he fired. Ultimately, America is a country built on violence, and thus to preserve its ideology, a bullet will always change more than words. But violence comes at a cost. And Doniphon, who once favoured brute ferocity is condemned to the consequences of using it. Melancholic and downbeat, there is nothing glamorised about the west here. Ford’s breakthrough western Stagecoach showcased the chaotically brutal but equally adventurous side of the west. In Liberty Valance, the older Stoddard sees the stagecoach that first brought him to Shinbone, now reduced to a dusty, broken-down relic of the past. Like Stoddard, Ford’s own Stagecoach brought him to the forefront as America’s premier film-maker. With the New Hollywood movement a few years away, it is as if Ford foresees himself as an obsolete artefact. Despite the polarizing racial politics of his filmography, one of the most poignant moments features Stewart teaching the illiterate townsfolk how to read and write. Wayne’s African American sidekick, Pompey (Woody Strode), is asked to recite the American constitution from memory but forgets the sentence that “all men are created equal”. Stewart replies: “That’s quite all right Pompey, a lot of people forget that part of it.” Sixty years on, people still seem to forget that part. As always, Ford brings his signature visual poetry to every frame. Doniphon is often framed in shadow to reflect his own personal, violent philosophy creeping into Stoddard’s psyche. And a shot of a cactus rose placed on a coffin is the greatest representation of unfulfilled love in film history. It’s a movie not driven by heroism but by regret at the choices and lies that were made in making America’s foundation. Wayne’s last scene is not a triumphant, gallant ride into the sunset, but bitterness and sadness at losing the woman he loved to Stewart. American masculinity never looked more defeated. And Stoddard is no Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Though he has brought statehood to Shinbone, he has done it through a method that goes against his personal convictions (“Isn’t it enough to kill a man without trying to build a life on it?”). Though not Ford’s last western, it serves as his own eulogy to the genre he helped shape. Wayne’s own legacy as an icon of radical conservative politics meant the director’s work was frequently interpreted as being intertwined with them. By burying his famous leading man, Ford has put an end to the mythic John Wayne character that was introduced in Stagecoach. After 50 years of making westerns, maybe he felt the legend was no longer worth printing.",Arts/Film,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance at 60: the great American western,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/the-man-who-shot-liberty-valance-great-american-western

4/22/2022,"Acheeky-faced boy of seven or eight is asked what he would wish for. “A big bike and a balloon that never bursts!” he replies with a huge grin, tickled with his answer. Another boy around the same age, more shabbily dressed and serious looking, is asked what life is about. He chews his bottom lip: “Life is something that is filled with difficulty.” This often heartbreaking, painful documentary from Ashkan Nejati and Mehran Nematollahi has a simple premise: interviewing Iranian schoolkids to camera about their lives, school, homework and hopes for the future. It’s a sequel of sorts to godfather of modern Iranian cinema Abbas Kiarostami’s 1989 documentary Homework, which put the same questions to children growing up in the shadow of the Iran-Iraq war. The new film features plenty of kids-say-the-funniest-things moments. A boy is asked which countries he’d like to visit? “Europe, America … Neptune!” And there’s some commentary on the Iranian education system. But what lingers is the film’s devastating snapshot of the gap between rich and poor. One of the rich kids, a placid round-faced boy, brags about how well-off his dad is and how many cars they’ve got. The interviewer gently probes him: do you know what wealth is? “Yes, someone who has a lot of cash like my dad.” Do you know what poverty is? “No.” If he ever watches the film he’ll find out. You can spot the poor kids instantly, and not just from their faded, many-times-washed sweaters and DIY haircuts. It’s their clenched body language and lined-before-their-time serious faces – a reminder that for them there’s no time for silliness or play. The headteacher of these boys explains that in calendar years, they are eight to 10, but maturity wise, more like 17 or 18. Most work afternoons and evenings, selling goods on the street or busking. One boy explains how he burns newspaper and rubs the soot on his face to look dirtier, more pitiable. Another pays his family’s rent and food. “I don’t buy toys. When you need to fill your belly, you don’t buy toys.” It’s not an easy watch, but these kids are invisible enough without the world shutting its eyes.

4/22/2022,"Sadiea Mustafa-Awan, an Oxford solicitor, spent years as a Labour member, including a decade working for one of the party’s MPs. But on 5 May she will stand for election with the express intention of removing a Labour councillor. Why? It’s all about traffic. “I just felt that Labour are not listening to residents,” Mustafa-Awan says. “Someone needs to tell them to think again. That’s what I’m trying to do.” There will be many subplots in next month’s local elections, held in various forms across the UK, not least whether a bad Conservative result could spell trouble for Boris Johnson. But few will be as bitterly argued over as low-traffic neighbourhoods, or LTNs. Mustafa-Awan is standing as an independent in her home ward of Littlemore, a couple of miles south-east of Oxford’s centre, hoping to persuade the ruling Labour group to remove an LTN put in place a year ago. LTNs, which use either fixed obstacles such as planters and bollards, or cameras to limit through-traffic along smaller residential streets, with cyclists and pedestrians passing as normal, have been used intermittently in the UK for decades, and are widely seen in some other countries. But a more widespread rollout amid efforts to boost bike and pedestrian travel during Covid has prompted an anguished and sometimes bitter debate about their fairness and effectiveness, or otherwise, coupled with some complaints about a perceived lack of consultation. It will particularly be a local election issue in London, where a series of LTNs have sprung up, and in some cases been removed. But as well as Oxford, LTNs and associated rows over bike lanes are factors in places including Edinburgh, Birmingham and Bath. Mustafa-Awan argues that her LTN was installed with minimal consultation, is unpopular locally, and funnels vehicle traffic towards busy main roads while bus services remain poor and local cycle routes unsafe, making alternative transport choices tricky. The Labour-run Oxfordshire county council says it has made some changes after consultation, and a final decision on the scheme will come next year. Mustafa-Awan is standing for the city council, which is not responsible for the LTN. But she says if she succeeds in ousting a Labour city councillor it will put wider pressure on the party. “I’m not against all LTNs as a matter of principle,” she says. “I’m against the ones in Littlemore because I don’t believe they work for the residents.” The rise of such single-issue politics is notable for a series of reasons. The first is how it reflects wider dissatisfaction about dominant ruling groups, especially in inner London, where many councils are de facto one-party Labour states. Another is how, in the heat of a local election battle, national policy platforms can be jettisoned. All three main English parties notionally support efforts to boost cycling, while the LTN policy is led by Downing Street. But a significant number of Conservative candidates, plus quite a few Liberal Democrats and even some Labour groups are standing on anti-LTN platforms. Jordan Redshaw, a Tory activist and a member of the Conservative Friends of Cycling, has produced a guide for the party’s candidates explaining why they should support LTNs and cycle lanes, but concedes it is an uphill battle. “We have no complaints about the central policy, but at a local level there is a pretty big disconnect,” he says. “I’m not even sure that some Conservative councillors are aware of the government’s pro-cycling stance.” Finally, the debate demonstrates a long-known fact about local politics: whether LTNs, or earlier rows about bike lanes and parking zones, some voters take policies that affect their driving very, very personally. Tony Travers, professor of politics at LSE, recounts how a London council held an ambitious, months-long consultation on the future of the borough and was delighted to get 2,200 responses. He adds: “Just afterwards there was a minor change to the parking rules in one area. It produced 3,500 public contacts, unsolicited.” Travers explains: “There’s this embedded issue, connected to traffic engineers and many councillors, who believe in getting away from cars and congestion and pollution. “They want cycling and pedestrians given priority. And people say, yes, of course we do want all this, but we don’t want it to affect our capacity to get about. It’s a perfectly respectable position to hold in a democracy. Politicians volunteer to square off these conflicts. That’s what they are there for.” It can, nonetheless, be an uncomfortable experience for some councillors, not least in gauging how unpopular, or not, an LTN scheme might be. “A lot of the debate about LTNs gets amplified by social media, meaning the siren voices go a long way,” said one north London councillor whose borough has introduced such schemes. “All this means it can be hard to know what people believe, unless you actually ask them. I was canvassing the other day inside an LTN, and a woman told me: ‘I assume I’m in a minority, but I actually like it.’ The people in the next five houses then said the same thing.” Some proof will come on 5 May, albeit with caveats. An independent like Mustafa-Awan has an inbuilt campaigning disadvantage battling an incumbent councillor from a big party. She is nonetheless bullish about her chances of removing the sitting Labour councillor: “This is a car-dependent area, and effectively we are cut off from the rest of the city. We need to send a message.”",News/Politics,Will local elections put the brakes on low-traffic neighbourhood schemes?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/will-local-elections-put-the-brakes-on-low-traffic-neighbourhood-schemes
4/22/2022,"While many pubs have adapted and modernised to stay afloat, Bath’s old Star Inn stays gloriously unchanged. There’s no food here except crisps and baps, no contemporary decor or fancy wine list; just local beers and jugs of draught Bass from barrels behind the bar, served in a series of little wood-panelled rooms and snugs where a fire burns in winter. The pub is built into one of Bath’s characteristic Georgian terraces, less than half a mile from the city centre’s sights, but just far enough to avoid crowds of visitors. The smooth limestone facade, hung with flowering baskets and carriage lamps, is the glowing goal at the end of a spectacular afternoon’s walk along the Cotswold Way. This acorn-waymarked National Trail runs for 102 miles between Bath and Chipping Campden, through wooded wolds and caramel-stone villages. My plan is to get a bus up into the hills and walk the last few miles of the Cotswold Way back down into the city. The countryside around Bath is far more peaceful than the touristy centre, and peppered with vantage points for admiring Bath’s panoramic cityscapes of honey-golden limestone. The 620 bus sets off north from Bath bus station towards a little village called Old Sodbury every three hours until 4.45pm, Monday to Saturday. You need to plan ahead. Get off after about 15 minutes at the bus stop called Battlefields, named after the Battle of Lansdown of 1643, a pyrrhic Royalist victory during the English civil war. The well-signed Cotswold Way soon leads to spectacular views from a ridge called Hanging Hill – across Bristol, to the distant Severn bridges. The route heads southwards through a gateway by a standing stone, into which Bristol-based artist Barbara Ash has carved a strange figure and the inscription: World Turned Upside Down. The words are the title of a 1640s ballad about parliament banning Christmas festivities and the image is of a man with his arms and legs reversed. It appeared on the woodcut-printed frontispiece of the original ballad and the cover of Christopher Hill’s 1972 history of radical ideas during the English revolution, also called The World Turned Upside Down. Near Lansdown golf course, about a mile further on, there’s another relatively recent installation, by David Michael Morse: in a field beside the path, a grinning, rusted grim reaper stands with a hellhound on a leash, facing two flying horses. Butterflies dance through the undergrowth nearby, disappearing into the mossy shadows of Pipley Wood, and long-tailed tits hop from branch to branch in the ash and hazel trees beside the path. The Cotswold Way zigzags across a big iron age hill fort, running along the edge of an ancient rampart to reach Bath racecourse, which opened in 1811. Soon after, there’s a semi-circular plaque next to the viewpoint known as Prospect Stile (although it’s now a gate) that points out dozens of landmarks ranged across the countryside. The nearest is Kelston Roundhill, a distinctive green knoll with a clump of trees on top, which you can detour to climb as the path heads down towards Bath. The main route meanders through the suburb of Weston, the Georgian streets of Sion Hill and the grassy slopes of High Common. In Royal Victoria Park there are ducks on the pond and squirrels chasing one another round the chestnut trunks. A young Princess Victoria officially opened the park in 1830, seven years before she became queen, and a tall obelisk in her honour rises above cedars and beeches. And then I’m at the Royal Crescent, the Grade I-listed curve of 30 terraced houses that epitomises Bath’s graceful limestone architecture. The Cotswold Way winds down from here towards the city’s busy centre, but you can walk instead through quieter lanes towards the Star and order a pint of Bellringer, a mellow golden bitter made at the Abbey Ales brewery just across the terraced gardens nearby. There are carved stone hops over the fireplace and built-in benches around the walls. Food here is back to basics (a small fridge full of soft rolls, well filled with cheese and onion or ham and chutney), but there’s an impressive collection of gins and single malts. I resist working through them and head back to my B&B to find a sofa-filled lounge and an honesty bar. The following day, nursing a slight hangover, I tackle the nearby Skyline Walk, a six-mile circuit of wooded hills and grassy downs to the east of the city, with plenty more jaw-dropping views across the spires and terraces below. It’s a pretty energetic route, with lots of ups and downs, despite its relatively short mileage on paper, and you’ll definitely have earned a sugared Bath bun with cream and jam by the end of it. I stroll a pleasant mile into the city centre and sit outside the Bath Bun Tea Shoppe under the shade of a big old plane tree on Abbey Green. I end the second day outside Bath Abbey, where the Cotswold Way officially finishes (or starts – you can walk it in either direction). The abbey itself, nicknamed the Lantern of the West, with its fan-vaulted ceiling and 52 glass windows, has just had a £20m refurbishment to shore up the sinking floor. Some of the dark Victorian wooden pews are gone, so the inside looks even lighter and airier.

4/22/2022,"Inflation is rampant, and supermarket prices are no exception. Shoppers are returning to stores to find old favourites have leapt in price from one week to the next. The cost of consumer goods is spiralling at such a rate that retail analysts have coined a new term, shelf shock. Nestlé, the owner of KitKat, Häagen-Dazs and Felix cat food, became the latest consumer goods group to warn of more pain to come on Thursday, saying it had raised prices by 5.2% in the first three months of this year and that rising production costs would force another increase soon. Retailers and manufacturers are passing on increases from energy and fuel bills, packaging and raw materials to shoppers. Across the board, the cost of a basket of basic commodities in the UK has risen by more than 11% compared with last March, according to research from the market analysts Assosia. Basic pasta, milk and instant coffee have all had double-digit increases. When we asked our readers where inflation was hitting them, they presented a long shopping list of items. The price of a tin of Sainsbury’s own-label dog food has risen from 40p to 70p. One reader said the 75% rise meant the cost of feeding her pet had soared to more than £250 a year. “It’s only a small item, but everything in my basket seems to have increased at the same rate, and wages have stagnated,” she said. The average price of a standard tin of supermarkets’ own-label dog food is up almost 42% in the past year to an average of 63p, according to analysis by the research firm Assosia for the Guardian. The price of tin, used for the packaging, has tripled in the past two years while soaring energy and transport costs and increasing meat prices are all pushing up the cost of pet food. Pret’s filter coffee rose to £1.40 a cup in February after an earlier rise from £1.25 in May 2021 from just 99p. The 41.4% rise in less than a year is due to a mix of factors, from ingredients to staffing and energy bills. The wholesale price of Arabica beans surged 70% last year, according to analysts at Rabobank, after one of the biggest producers, Brazil, suffered from a mix of droughts and the worst frost in more than two decades. Global shipping costs have also forced up the price while Pret’s staff bill has increased, partly because of Brexit. The owner of Lucozade changed the size of all its bottles from 1 litre to 900ml last year saying it had done so to keep the price of the bottle at £1 “as we know it’s an important price for our customers”. But late last year it put up the price of those smaller bottles so that most retailers are now selling them at £1.25 – a 38% rise in cost per ml from a year ago. Prices on Lucozade and many other fizzy drinks have risen as the cost of packaging, transport and raw ingredients have all risen sharply. The food-grade CO2, the gas that makes the bubbles, has more than tripled in price as it is closely linked to the production of fertiliser, which is under pressure from rising energy costs. The price of producing plastic bottles, meanwhile, has jumped about 15% in the last six months alone, according to industry insiders. It’s crunch time for peanuts with inflation sneaking in. In October last year it emerged that a bag of KP peanuts had shrunk to 225g, replacing 250g for £2.50. Now that same bag costs £2.65 in leading supermarkets – or a price rise of 17% a gram in less than a year. Assosia found that own-label dry roasted peanuts had not changed price in the past year. However, industry insiders said savoury snacks in general have faced inflation due to the rising price of cooking oil, packaging and energy. The war in Ukraine has added to those pressures. The price of an Always Ultra sanitary pad has increased just over 7.5% in recent weeks. But you may not have noticed: the packs have stayed the same price – an average £1.63 across the big supermarkets according to Assosia – but now contain 13 not 14 pads. Tesco, Bodyform and Sainsbury’s have all marked up sanitary towels too in recent weeks, according to the Grocer trade journal, amid rising energy and fuel costs. The journal said Tesco had doubled the price of its cheapest Essentials pads to 4p each. Charity Freedom4Girls said the issue meant that some women were having to choose between feeding their family or buying sanitary products and it had seen incidences of women staying away from work as they could not afford the items they needed to manage their periods. One reader said the price of a Tesco toilet roll had not altered but the rolls appeared to have shrunk considerably – perhaps to half the size. The average price of a nine-pack of own-label toilet roll at a British supermarket has risen nearly 1% in the past year, according to analysis by Assosia. However, Tesco apparently has found a new way of winding its toilet paper more tightly on to cardboard tubes, which reduces the size of its large multipacks – without changing the number of sheets on a roll. It says the innovation will save 67 tonnes of plastic packaging each year and cut down on the lorries needed for transportation.",News/Business,Shelf shock: soaring supermarket prices shoppers find hard to swallow,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/shelf-shock-soaring-supermarket-prices-shoppers-find-hard-to-swallow

4/22/2022,"Scott Morrison says China is exerting “enormous pressure” on Pacific island countries, as the Australian prime minister fends off questions about whether his government was caught off-guard by the security deal with Solomon Islands. Morrison said it was not “just as easy as picking up the phone or sending a foreign minister”, after Labor characterised the signing of the deal as the biggest Australian foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war. Questions are being asked about when Australia knew about the security agreement being negotiated between Solomon Islands and China, amid conflicting accounts about whether ministers were blindsided. Morrison said he had spoken with the prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, “on several occasions this year” including “within the last month or so”, although he did not provide specific dates. But it would be counterproductive for Australia to be seen as “throwing its weight around in the region”, Morrison told reporters on Friday. “We can’t kid ourselves,” Morrison said during an election campaign media conference in Brisbane. “There’s enormous pressure and influence which is placed on Pacific island leaders across the region, which the Chinese government have been engaged in for some time.” Morrison told the Seven Network earlier on Friday that Australia had “a very good understanding” about China’s activities in the Pacific, when asked by a television host whether bribery could have played a role in the deal being inked. Morrison did not repudiate that suggestion, but said Beijing did not “play by the same rules as transparent liberal democracies”. Several Australian ministers have previously indicated they were caught off-guard after a draft of the agreement was leaked online on 24 March. The draft raised the possibility China could “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”, while Chinese forces could be used “to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, was asked in a Senate estimates hearing on 1 April when she had first became aware of the proposed deal, and said: “When it became public – I think it was a social media post on 24 March.” New Zealand’s defence minister, Peeni Henare, said both he and the Australian defence minister, Peter Dutton, had been caught “off-guard” by the draft deal. “We were both surprised, because the intelligence we were getting didn’t exactly match that,” Henare told Stuff in the days after the deal. “We knew that there were some challenges there, with respect to China, but the leaked draft agreement … it did catch me as a surprise, and even minister Dutton.” Dutton’s office declined to comment. But behind the scenes, officials have been briefing that the government was aware of what was going on in Honiara ahead of the leak. Morrison refused on Friday to confirm reports from the Nine newspapers that Australian intelligence may also have played a role in the leak of the draft agreement, saying he would “never comment on intelligence matters of that nature” and they were “highly sensitive matters”. In the days following the leak, the opposition leader of Solomon Islands, Matthew Wale, said he had warned Australia about the draft agreement last year. Wale told Guardian Australia that he had warned Australia’s high commissioner to Solomon Islands, Dr Lachlan Strahan, about the deal in August or September 2021. He said Strahan “took note of it and that’s the last I heard”. Labor used this allegation from Wale to criticise the government for not acting sooner or more concertedly to head off the deal. Wale’s claims are disputed by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which claims that a meeting between Wale and Strahan took place in May 2021, not August 2021. “Opposition leader Wale and officials did not discuss a possible security agreement with China during this meeting or any other,” a Dfat spokesperson said. Labor has criticised the government for sending a junior minister, Zed Seselja, to Honiara last week, rather than the foreign minister or the prime minister. The signing of the deal was announced on Tuesday this week. Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said Morrison had not been upfront with Australians about the security deal, noting some ministers had said “they were all over this” and other ministers were “saying they didn’t know”. “We know Mr Morrison doesn’t hold a hose – apparently he doesn’t pick up the phone either,” she told reporters in Perth on Friday. Wong said the government should have sprung into action “when they were first advised about this prospect”, but instead had failed to act upon “warning after warning, signpost after signpost”. She said China was “much more assertive and much more aggressive”, and Australia needed to ensure it remained a partner of choice for the Pacific. A Labor government would bring more energy, focus and resources to diplomacy with the Pacific, she added. But Morrison said the Australian government had followed “a very careful process” based on “informed advice that we get from our intelligence and security agencies”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition attempted to discredit Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, focusing on his comments from last year that “basing our actions in the Pacific on an attempt to strategically deny China would be a historic mistake’’. “Australia has no right to expect a set of exclusive relationships with the Pacific nations,” Marles wrote in the book The Tides That Bind: Australia in the Pacific, according to a front-page report in News Corp’s The Australian. “They are perfectly free to engage on whatever terms they choose with China or, for that matter, any other country. Disputing this would be resented, as the recent past has shown.” Dutton said it was “quite startling” that Marles could have made such statements, which were “remarkably similar” to the position of the Greens. Wong said Marles had been attempting to make the point that “we live in a world where there’s a competition for influence” and “in that world, you can’t sit back”.",News/Australia news,"China is exerting ‘enormous pressure’ on Pacific island nations, Scott Morrison says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/china-is-exerting-enormous-pressure-on-pacific-island-nations-scott-morrison-says
4/22/2022,"The UK’s national parks should not be considered “protected areas” unless the way they look after wildlife radically improves, according to a new report. Internationally, the UK is leading calls to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030 (the “30x30” target), but is failing to protect its own wildlife, says a report by the British Ecological Society (BES). Protected areas such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs) make up 28% of UK land, but only about 5% is effectively protected. The report recommends that they should not be included in the UK’s total in their current state. Such areas can support higher species richness but “very often the report finds that those benefits are negligible”, said Prof Jane Hill, an ecologist from the University of York and one of the report’s authors. “The evidence is that most protected landscapes are not delivering for nature and only a low percentage are in good ecological condition. However, because there is existing governance in place managing these landscapes, they have great potential to be adapted to improve how they deliver for nature.” The BES Protected Areas and Nature Recovery report argues that landscapes should be designated a protected area only if it is proved that wildlife is recovering in the long term. Key reasons for poor ecological condition include unsustainable farming and fishing practices, pollution and the spread of non-native species. Governments around the world are negotiating the next decade of UN targets to protect nature, with dozens of countries pledging to protect 30x30, as area-based conservation is key to tackling the climate and ecological crises. Yet many are failing to have a positive effect on wildlife, according to a separate report on 1,500 protected sites worldwide, published this week in Nature. “Protected landscapes – such as national parks and AONBs etc – were not designated primarily for biodiversity. A repurposing is required for them to be included in 30x30,” said Dr Joseph Bailey of York St John University, lead author of the BES report. “This is no small task and will require substantial and sustained resourcing to ensure they deliver for nature in the long term. Such a reform could in fact be one of the most positive outcomes for 30x30.” Protected areas are underfunded and as a result have been forced to make compromises, the BES report finds. Within national parks there is also limited data on how well wildlife areas are being looked after. Better enforcement, monitoring and long-term protection are needed, and adequate money and resources should be made available for this to happen, researchers said. On their own, protected areas are not enough to stem the country’s catastrophic loss of biodiversity. Landscapes surrounding them also need to be better managed to support nature, which is increasingly important as species shift their range in response to climate change. However, researchers say a lot of positive work is starting to happen, including more nature-friendly farming, peatland restoration and wetland management. Thirty-eight per cent of UK seas are marine protected areas (MPAs), but in practice many have no management measures in place and are threatened by damaging and unregulated bottom trawling. Fishing is banned in only 0.0024% of UK waters, currently covering three MPAs. Rick Stafford, of Bournemouth University and an author of the BES report, said: “The proposal to protect 30% of UK seas is very welcome, but we need effective management measures in place in MPAs which will protect wildlife and benefit local coastal communities. “The lack of comprehensive management or enforcement means that the majority are failing to deliver for nature and bring the full range of biodiversity benefits they otherwise could.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Most UK national parks deliver ‘negligible benefits’ for wildlife,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/uk-national-parks-deliver-negligible-benefits-for-wildlife-aoe
