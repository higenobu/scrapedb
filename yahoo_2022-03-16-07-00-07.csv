3/16/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea had its deadliest day yet of the pandemic on Tuesday, with 293 deaths reported in the latest 24 hours, as the country grapples with a record surge in coronavirus infections driven by the fast-moving omicron variant. The 1,196 virus patients in serious or critical conditions were also a new high. Health officials said the country’s medical response remains stable following efforts to expand resources, with more than 30% of intensive care units designated for COVID-19 treatment still available. But the strain on the hospital system is expected to increase in coming weeks, considering the time lags between infections, hospitalizations and deaths. “We anticipate the number of (serious or critical cases) to grow to around 2,000. We are preparing our medical response for that,” senior Health Ministry official Park Hyang said during a briefing. South Korea has reported a daily average of around 337,000 new cases in the past seven days, including 362,283 on Tuesday, representing more than an 80-fold increase from levels seen in mid-January, when omicron emerged as the dominant strain. The country’s caseload is now over 7.2 million, with 6.4 million added since February. Park said because of high vaccination rates, the country has so far weathered the omicron surge with lower levels of fatalities than what was seen in the United States and Europe, which was hit by the variant earlier. More than 62% of South Koreans have received booster shots. The country so far has 17.6 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people, compared to 285.5 deaths in the U.S. and 237.5 in Britain, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The omicron variant has forced South Korea to abandon a stringent COVID-19 response based on mass laboratory tests, aggressive contact tracing and quarantines to focus limited medical resources on priority groups, including people 60 and older and those with preexisting medical conditions. The omicron surge and its growing economic toll will pose an immediate major challenge for conservative South Korean president-elect Yoon Suk Yeol, who will take office in May after narrowly winning last week’s election. Yoon has been critical of the COVID-19 response under current liberal President Moon Jae-in, which was seen as a relative success before a devastating delta-driven spread in the winter, accusing officials of maintaining an unsustainable approach that squeezed medical workers and livelihoods before being broken by omicron. Yoon has promised relaxed social distancing rules and stronger financial support for small businesses, but has yet to issue clear-cut plans to cope with the expected increase in hospitalizations and deaths. Health officials have recently significantly eased quarantine restrictions and border controls and stopped requiring adults to show proof of vaccination or negative tests when entering potentially crowded spaces like restaurants so that more public and health workers could respond to rapidly expanding at-home treatments. The country has also reshaped its testing regime to be centered around rapid antigen tests, despite concerns over their accuracy, to save laboratory tests mostly for high-risk groups. Officials may take further steps to  ease social distancing  soon after extending the curfew at restaurants, bars, movie theaters and other businesses earlier this month to ease the pandemic’s shock on service sector businesses. More than 1.6 million virus carriers with mild or moderate symptoms have been asked to isolate at home to save hospital space, the KDCA said. The country will also begin a vaccine rollout for children between the ages of 5 and 11 later this month.",World/Associated Press,South Korea reports record deaths amid omicron surge,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-reports-record-deaths-035638289.html
3/16/2022,"If you love sipping cocktails while catching up with friends or enjoying a glass of wine for the health benefits, unfortunately it may cause you some digestive issues. Here's what dietitian Anthea Levi, MS, RD, says about alcohol and gut health, and how drinking can cause inflammation and affect your gut microbiome. Alcohol is pro-inflammatory, meaning it can promote inflammation throughout the body, including in the gut, Levi explains. That's a problem, since research shows that prolonged intestinal inflammation can increase our risk of conditions like liver disease, gastrointestinal cancers, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). She adds that alcohol can also lead to adverse changes in the makeup of the gut microbiome, which is the all-important ecosystem that lives within our gastrointestinal tract. The science tells us that booze can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the gut, driving down the number of beneficial bugs (like lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) and increasing the number of bad bugs. Some studies suggest that chronic alcohol use can interfere with the integrity of the gut lining, Levi says, ""resulting in intestinal permeability or leaky gut."" This can cause food sensitivities and inflammation throughout the body. In the short term, changes in bowel habits may indicate that alcohol is having a negative impact on your gut. Ever had the runs the morning after a night of drinking? Levi says that's because heavy alcohol consumption can speed up motility through the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, the body may have less time to absorb fluids from gastrointestinal contents, so the stool remains loose. This can also cause smelly gas and bloating. On the flip side, Levi adds that some people may experience constipation after drinking due to alcohol's dehydrating qualities. Long-term signs that alcohol consumption is messing with the gut may include abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and bloating, which are symptoms of conditions like gastritis or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, Levi says. She adds that significant damage to the intestines due to excessive alcohol consumption can also compromise the body's ability to absorb nutrients from food, leading to malnutrition and unintended weight loss. When it comes to how beer, wine, or hard liquor affect your gut, there may not be a huge difference. Alcohol percentage may alter how different types of drinks affect digestion, but there are conflicting findings out there. You want to focus more on the sugar content in alcohol, Levi says. Since high amounts of sugar can affect digestion, avoid super-sugary cocktails and those made with artificial sweeteners or soda. The gluten in beer could also affect those with celiac or those with nonceliac gluten sensitivity. Drinking on an empty stomach isn't recommended either, and Levi says to sip on water or seltzer in between alcoholic drinks to prevent the dehydration that can cause digestive issues. On the plus side, some research suggests that the polyphenols in red wine may boost beneficial bacteria in the gut while driving down bad bacteria, Levi says. Since larger amounts of bad bacteria in the gut have been linked to a greater risk of colon cancer and IBD, red wine may be a better choice compared to alternatives like hard liquor. But should drinking red wine be your go-to gut-healthy habit? No chance. Emphasize fiber-rich whole foods and probiotics like yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut before booze. Related: 10 Dietitian-Approved Tips to Prevent Uncomfortable Bloating ""The negative effects of alcohol on gut health are compounded by the fact that our food choices often shift when we're feeling tipsy,"" Levi says. If you're opting for cake and fries when the late-night munchies hit every Saturday night, the sugar and fried foods won't do your gut any favors. You don't need to nix alcohol entirely, but the less you drink, the better from a gut-health perspective. If you do choose to drink, the real key is drinking in moderation. Women should aim for a max of one drink per day, while men should aim for a max of two.",Health/POPSUGAR,How Drinking Alcohol Affects Your Gut Health,https://news.yahoo.com/drinking-alcohol-affects-gut-health-151053186.html
3/16/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Monday that the Russian invasion of Ukraine may have ushered in a new era after the post-Cold War period, and the way the world responds will likely shape that new era. Japan, keeping pace with its Group of Seven peers, has frozen assets of major Russian banks, President Vladimir Putin and other leaders, while joining the West in blocking certain Russian banks' access to international payments system SWIFT. ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine is greatly changing the appearance of the international community. A new era that comes after the post-Cold War period may already be starting,"" Kishida said in a video message during an online seminar. ""Whether the world can respond resolutely to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and protect the core of the international order is a litmus test to foresee the era that follows the post-Cold War period."" More than two weeks after the Feb. 24 invasion, Ukraine has said it is in talks with Russia on a ceasefire and immediate withdrawal of troops. Truces designed to get aid to Ukrainian cities besieged by Russian forces and to evacuate civilians have frequently failed.

3/16/2022,"By Krisztina Than BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will not send any weapons to Ukraine and will stay out of the war, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a rally of his supporters on Tuesday, accusing the opposition of trying to drag Hungary into the conflict on its eastern border. The conservative nationalist leader has a tight race for election to a fourth consecutive term on April 3 because for the first time since 2010 his right-wing Fidesz party will face a united front of six opposition parties. Orban's path to re-election is complicated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has put his decade-long close relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a new light, drawing sharp criticism from the opposition. Addressing a rally of tens of thousands of supporters who waved the Hungarian national flag in front of parliament, Orban said Central Europe was only a ""chess board"" for big powers and if Hungary did not stand up for its interests, it could easily fall victim of the crisis. ""Russia looks at Russian interests, while Ukraine looks at Ukrainian interests. Neither the United States, nor Brussels would think with Hungarians' mind and feel with Hungarians' hearts. We must stand up for our own interests,"" Orban said. ""We must stay out of this war ... therefore we will not send any troops or weapons to the battlegrounds."" Orban said the choice for voters on April 3 will be between his party that wants peace and the leftist opposition ""which would stagger into a ruthless, protracted and bloody war."" The six-party opposition, led by Peter Marki-Zay, a small-town mayor and father of seven, has sharply criticised Orban's relations with Russia, saying Orban had built an illiberal state along Putin's model, with rampant corruption and curbs on media freedoms. The government denies the allegations. Speaking to an opposition rally by the Danube river, Marki-Zay, who has campaigned on a strongly pro-European platform, said Hungarians' choice has never been this easy in elections. ""We only have one choice: we must choose Europe instead of the east ... and freedom instead of authoritarianism,"" he said, with supporters chanting ""Europa, Europa."" Referring to European Union concerns about a decline in democratic standards in Hungary, Marki-Zay has said Orban's ""unlimited power has resulted in unlimited corruption"" while millions of Hungarians struggle to make ends meet. Fidesz slightly widened its lead in a late February opinion poll by Median to 39% compared with 32% for the opposition bloc. Orban has condemned the Russian invasion and has said Budapest would not veto EU sanctions agreed against Russia but that these must not affect Hungary's energy supplies.

3/16/2022,"A Ukrainian police officer at the gruesome scene where an American journalist was shot and killed and at least two others were wounded by Russian forces Sunday had a gut-wrenching message. ""Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist,"" the outraged officer told PBS correspondent Jane Ferguson from the roadside scene near Irpin, outside of Kyiv, where the body of American journalist and former The New York Times contributor Brent Renaud was lying beneath a blanket. AMERICAN JOURNALIST KILLED AT CHECKPOINT, RUSSIAN AIRSTRIKE KILLS 35, WOUNDS 135: LIVE UPDATES Renaud was not on assignment for The Times in Ukraine but contributed to the newspaper in the past, most recently in 2015, a NYT spokeswoman told Fox News Digital. He and another journalist were reportedly headed to Irpin to take photos of refugees fleeing the area and were offered a ride. Initial reports said Russian forces fired upon their car, but Fox News has not independently confirmed who fired. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Pravda Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, shared a video on Telegram purportedly showing the wounded American journalist lying on a hospital bed in the capital, telling a spokeswoman for the Okhmatdyt Hospital recording him that he was separated from his colleague, Renaud, who was left behind. Ukrainian Parliament also shared the video on Twitter. The man, who said his name was Juan and he was from the U.S., described how both he and Renaud approached a second bridge in the car and crossed a checkpoint near Irpin when they were fired upon. Speaking while medical staff attended to his wound, he said he was brought to the hospital by an ambulance and did not know the status of his colleague. Initial reports identified him as Juan Arredondo, and an Instagram account with the same name said he was a journalist for National Geographic and an adjunct professor at Columbia University. Fox News has not independently identified him or his employment status, and requests for comment to NatGeo and Columbia went unanswered Sunday. In an appearance on CNN Sunday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said he just heard reports about an American journalist killed before coming on air and still needed to confirm information. ""If in fact an American journalist was killed, it is a shocking and horrifying event,"" Sullivan told CNN host Dana Bash. ""It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces. They’ve targeted schools and mosques and hospitals and journalists. And it is why we are working so hard to impose severe consequences on him and to try to help the Ukrainians with every form of military assistance we can muster to be able to push back against the onslaught of these Russian forces."" The Main Directorate of the National Police in Kyiv Region first tweeted photos purportedly showing a bloodied Renaud, his U.S. passport and his photo ID badge for The New York Times enclosed in a holder labeled U.S. peacemaker. In another video from the scene of the shooting, Ukrainian police officer Alexander Bugai said that in addition to 51-year-old Renaud being killed, two others were wounded. It wasn’t immediately clear if a third journalist was shot or if it was the driver of the car injured. A graphic photo included in the post appeared to show a gunshot wound that pierced Renaud’s skull. According to his bio on IMBD, Renaud was a Peabody and DuPont Award winning filmmaker and spent the past two decades producing films and television programs with his brother Craig. ""The Renaud Brothers are best known for telling humanistic stories from the World's hot spots and their projects have covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the earthquake in Haiti, political turmoil in Egypt and Libya, the fight for Mosul, extremism in Africa, cartel violence in Mexico, and the youth refugee crisis in Central America,"" according to the biography. Their work has won many of the top awards in television and journalism, including a Peabody Award, two Columbia DuPont Awards, two Overseas Press Club Awards, an Edward R. Murrow Award, an IDA Award, a DGA nomination for Best Directors and multiple Emmy nominations, the bio said.",World/Fox News,Ukrainian police officer implores correspondent to 'tell America' what Russians did to 'a journalist',https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-police-officer-implores-correspondent-104224765.html
3/16/2022,"Ukrainian soldiers shouted ""God save the Queen!"" when using UK-made weapons, The Sunday Times said. As of March 9, the UK had sent Ukraine 3,615 NLAW anti-tank missiles, the UK defense secretary said. The Sunday Times said Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the weapons in calls with Boris Johnson. Ukrainian soldiers shouted ""God save the Queen!"" when they fired weaponry given to the country by the UK, The Sunday Times of London reported, citing an anecdote that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told. It's one of several lighthearted details described in the paper's report on the calls between Zelenskyy and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in which they discussed the UK sending weapons to Ukraine to defend against Russia. As of March 9 the UK had sent 3,615 anti-tank weapons known as NLAWs — next-generation light anti-tank weapons — to assist Ukraine, Sky News reported, citing UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Journalists from MailOnline — a British publication — were also greeted with ""God save the Queen!"" during a reporting trip to a base where Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to use NLAWs, the MailOnline reported. The Sunday Times reported that in a recent call, Zelenskyy serenaded the UK prime minister with two songs adapted to play on the similar sound of NLAW and ""in love"" when pronounced in Ukrainian, which sometimes voices a W sound as a V. They were ""All You Need Is N-Love,"" based on The Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love,"" and ""When You're Young and in Love"" by The Marvelettes, the paper said. NLAWs are shoulder-mounted weapons capable of firing a single 150 mm high-explosive anti-tank missile up to 2,600 feet. They are built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by the French company Thales, and they have been highly praised in Ukraine's defense. They've enabled many of the tank ambushes that have slowed Russia's invasion. A video published by Sky News on February 26 showed the aftermath of a Ukrainian attack, where a soldier carried an NLAW not far from the smoldering ruins of tanks on a highway. —Sky News (@SkyNews) February 26, 2022 James Cleverly, a minister in the UK foreign office and a former soldier, was among many in the UK to celebrate the contributions of the weapons, alongside other UK military donations. ""British desert uniform, British DPM waterproofs, British NLWs, Ukrainian spirit.
