3/4/2022,"Labour activists may have been beset by last-minute nerves on a rainy polling day in Birmingham Erdington but, in the end, Paulette Hamilton’s victory was a comfortable one. Her 55% of the vote beat Labour’s 50.3% the last time it was contested, in the December 2019 general election, by the much-loved veteran MP Jack Dromey. The Conservatives, meanwhile, had aimed to maintain their 2019 vote share of 40% – but were beaten back to 36.3%, after Labour poured MPs and campaigners into the seat to get out the vote on Thursday. Keir Starmer’s team feel they have come a very long way since the humiliating loss of the Hartlepool byelection to the Tories last May. Erdington never appeared likely to go the same way as Hartlepool. Despite being a constituency that voted to leave the EU, with 63% in favour, there was no significant Brexit party vote from 2019 for the Conservatives to squeeze – and more importantly, Labour is in a much stronger position. Starmer has carried out a painful restructuring of the party’s internal machinery, and carried out a major reshuffle of his frontbench – and since the Partygate revelations, Labour have consistently led the Tories in the polls. Most importantly, though, they feel the public are beginning to give them a hearing on day-to-day, bread-and-butter issues including the cost-of-living crisis, which repeatedly came up on the doorstep in Erdington. That has been all but impossible for much of Starmer’s two years as leader, as the pandemic dominated people’s lives and captured the headlines. Despite its relatively comfortable victory, there is little for Labour to be complacent about, however, and there are two particular worries. First, there is no sign yet either in the Erdington result or national polling that Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, and Boris Johnson’s approach to it, have caused voters to rally to the government’s side. But it may make it harder for Labour to raise the issues on which Starmer and his team feel they have a strong offer to make to the public. And, like the early days of the pandemic, it demands staunch support for the government’s position, as seen in the cross-party ovation given to the Ukrainian ambassador in the Commons on Wednesday. Starmer has pushed the government to go further, in sanctioning Russian oligarchs, for example, but there is a tacit acceptance that this is not a time for politicking – which is hard for any opposition party. Second, while his personal popularity is rising steadily, there are still qualms among some in Starmer’s party about whether he has the star quality to lead them to a general election victory, and the 27% turnout in Thursday’s poll has done nothing to assuage that view. Erdginton is traditionally a low turnout seat, and Labour activists pointed to the grotty March weather as another explanation, But they had poured activists into the seat for weeks, including much of the frontbench. Byelections do tend to attract a lower turnout, without the weeks of national fanfare that precede a nationwide poll. But the total vote on Thursday, of 17,016 voters, was lower than Dromey’s individual vote in 2019. That may suggest that, as yet, Labour is not generating great enthusiasm among the voters in heartland seats it needs to hang on to – or in Tory-held seats win back to its side – if it is to win the next general election.",News/Politics,Erdginton result shows there might not yet be enough enthusiasm for Labour,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/04/erdginton-result-enthusiasm-labour-victory
3/4/2022,"Of all the superheroes, DC Comics’ Batman is now endowed with the most Dostoyevskian seriousness. It wasn’t always like this. And, in my heart, my favourite Batman is the first movie version, from 1966, which grew out of the wacky TV show in the era of Get Smart and I Dream Of Jeannie and Mad magazine. As kids, we watched the program religiously on TV, which is where I caught up with the film about Batman and Robin taking on Joker, Penguin, Catwoman and Riddler – never dreaming that it was anything other than deadly serious. I watched it in the same spirit as I now watch Michael Mann films. I was thrilled by the (genuinely) propulsive and exciting “dinner-dinner-dinner-dinner” theme tune (how I resented the vulgar playground joke about what Batman’s mum shouts out of the window to get him in at mealtimes) and quivered at the brilliant, psychedelically conceived title-cards for fights: BAM! I also fanatically pored over the novelisation tie-in – Batman vs The Fearsome Foursome.The show-stopper was the famous, entertainingly tense sequence where Batman can’t find anywhere to dispose of a smoking bomb, something that surely inspired the later Zucker/Abrahams comedies. Adam West played the sonorous Bruce Wayne and Batman and Burt Ward was Robin (confusingly, his alter ego Dick Grayson was often described as Wayne’s “ward”). Their costumes, with luxuriant silk capes, were gorgeous. Brilliant acting talent lined up for the villains: Latin lover Cesar Romero was the Joker; veteran Hollywood character turn Burgess Meredith was Penguin, Lee Meriwether fused glamour and comedy as Catwoman (replacing TV’s Julie Newmar) and impressionist and night-club comic Frank Gorshin was Riddler. Much is said about the campiness of this show – and yes, there is a case for retrospectively re-interpreting this Batman and Robin as a covert queer statement. (In fact, it was Cesar Romero who kept the press guessing about his sexuality.) But in a way, it was more about goofiness as part of the Sixties Zeitgeist: being silly, even at this level, was countercultural seriousness. I suspect that every single Batman director, from Joel Schumacher to Christopher Nolan, measures their work against the addictive Day-Glo potency of the ’66 Batman. Pow! Peter Bradshaw In the flood of frowningly serious superhero films that have emerged since, the true brilliance of Tim Burton’s then-revolutionary two Batfilms has become somewhat obscured, largely because of the silly Joel Schumacher follow-ups that demonstrated that the wrath of fanship was something Hollywood had to be careful of. But it’s totally worth another look: drinking deep of the gothic/deco vibe beloved of comic-book rebooter Frank Miller, Burton adds that distinctive combination of beautiful detailing and lurid trashiness that has marked out all his best work. When I saw it back in the day, I remember thinking Michael Keaton was bit of a waste of space, but in retrospect his straight-arrow blandness works superbly off Jack Nicholson’s gurning and Kim Basinger’s sultriness. It’s worth remembering too, that this was the first major Batman feature since the Adam West one in 1966 – hilarious, but one Burton clearly wanted to put some distance from. Tonally, the whole thing is just great, it hits that sweet spot between flippant self-parody and unironic spectacle – most superhero films since have veered too close to either. No Batman film, in this writer’s opinion, has come close since. Andrew Pulver I yearn for the day that comic book movies can be sexy again, when a new Caped Crusader and Catwoman can exude just a fraction of the pheromones fogging up the screen in Batman Returns. The moonlight tussles between those iconic characters played by Michael Keaton and Michelle Pfieffer are an alluring and thorny mix of acrobatic choreography and S&M violence that simply would not fly today. Batman Returns belongs to Pfeiffer, whose purrr-fect take on Catwoman, AKA Selina Kyle, as a feral woman scorned is unparalleled. And it’s not just because she makes people weak in the knees with her throaty delivery of “hear me roar.” Her origin story involves being demeaned at the office and then shoved out a window by her Trump-like boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), a bully with sexual menace in his eyes. Pfieffer absorbs that trauma into her performance as a Catwoman who is at once vulnerable and dangerous, seductive and afraid, craving affection but brimming with anger. That complicated push-pull is even there in a steamy and thrilling fireside canoodle with Bruce Wayne, where she’s torn between giving her all and hiding her scars before the sex is interrupted. Radheyan Simonpillai Even as a cartoon, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm’s got it all – gangster thrills, municipal corruption and the residual anguish of long lost love. Set in the 1940s, it follows our hero’s pursuit of the Phantasm, a seemingly supernatural angel of death who appears in Gotham equipped with a voice modulator and menacing scythe. As they snuff out the city’s mob bosses one by one, they frame Batman for the murders. The Caped Crusader, meanwhile, is haunted by his own memories from a decade earlier, when his broken engagement to the wealthy and beautiful Andrea Beaumont drove him to his current life of darkness. As a spinoff of Batman: The Animated Series, arguably the greatest iteration of the franchise there ever was, Phantasm offers the same intricate plotlines that cemented the TV show’s greatness – Bruce Wayne was not just brooding, he was emotionally complex. Plus, the film’s got style; having emerged after the Day-Glo camp of the 1960s Batman and just before Joel Schumacher’s similarly kitschy universe, Phantasm marked a pendulum swing into a darker iteration, of an art deco Gotham filled with film noir shadows, and a cinematic score with the sweeping love scenes of a second world war epic. Phantasm is one of those rare childhood favorites that holds up into adulthood. Janelle Zara Gaudy, kaleidoscopic and winkingly homoerotic, the 90s-saturated Batman Forever is a growing addiction that I can’t deny, the light on the dark side of the Batman film franchise. Consider the blockbuster’s cast: Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey and Chris O’Donnell, all at the height of their powers, with appearances by Drew Barrymore, George Wallace and members of En Vogue. Each embodies Forever’s more-is-more ethos: an orange-haired, jumpsuit-clad Carrey air-thrusts, mimics pitching a baseball, twirls a question-mark-shaped cane, and screams “Joygasm!” all while destroying the Batmobile; Kilmer rasps, “Chicks love the car,” as an oversexed Kidman caresses his infamous nippled Batsuit; and just about everything about Jones’s grunting and cackling Two-Face, from his fuchsia-colored scars to his puffing of two cigarettes, one lit via flamethrower, from each side of his mouth. Not to mention the chart-topping soundtrack featuring songs by ’90s mega acts U2, Method Man, Brandy, Massive Attack, the Offspring and the Flaming Lips – and led by Seal’s unforgettable Grammy-winning karaoke classic, Kiss From a Rose. More than 26 years later, it’s safe to say Joel Schumacher’s first foray to Gotham will never be the cinematic classic that Tim Burton’s or Christopher Nolan’s takes on the tale have become. But in dark times, Batman Forever’s light hits the gloom on the gray. Lisa Wong Macabasco Consider, for a moment, that a film beginning with snap zooms on its main characters’ taut tushes, proud codpieces and pert nipples may be in on its own joke. Those erroneously defaming Joel Schumacher’s camp classic as “bad” most likely subscribe to the confused notion that superhero movies are serious business, a belief estranged from the color, humor and roiling homoeroticism of old-school comics revived here. Even if the Adam West TV show hadn’t provided us with a clear precedent for a sillier Batman, there’s still too much deliberate artistry at play to write off Schumacher’s choices as invalid: the stunning soundstage sets under exploded-rainbow lighting, the magnificent costume design splitting the difference between the Met Ball and a drag ball, the Marlene Dietrich gorilla-costume striptease that explains what Uma Thurman’s doing with her voice as Poison Ivy. Schumacher seized on the oft-denied truth that there’s a fundamental absurdity to encasing one’s self in spandex and fighting crime, his direction suggesting that donning the bat-suit still counts as playing dress-up. You don’t like Mr. Freeze’s unlimited supply of cold-themed puns delivered in the blunt-force howl of Arnold Schwarzenegger? Fine, just have the decency to admit that that’s a you-issue, a matter of tastes rather than garden-variety incompetence. Charles Bramesco The surprisingly rich 2000 animated adventure Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker stands apart thanks to its dark, character-driven mystery plot. Return of the Joker should, in that sense, work just as well with Bat-fans who are unfamiliar with Batman Beyond, a sci-fi spinoff of the acclaimed Batman: The Animated Series that takes place in the Gotham City of the future (2019!) and follows angsty teenager Terry McGinnis (Will Friedle) as he takes over the role of Batman from old man Bruce Wayne (Batman: The Animated Series’s Kevin Conroy). In Return of the Joker, Terry takes on the Joker (Mark Hamill), whose reappearance, after decades of being presumed dead, reminds Bruce of a traumatic memory involving his kid sidekick Tim “Robin” Drake (Matthew Valencia) and Barbara “Batgirl” Gordon (Tara Strong), who replaced her father as Gotham’s police commissioner. Fan-favorite screenwriter Paul Dini focuses on Terry and Bruce’s frustrated mentor/pupil relationship, as when Bruce confesses to Terry: “I had no right to force this life on you or anyone else.” And the great character actor Dean Stockwell complements the typically sharp ensemble voice cast as an adult Tim, now retired and seemingly happier for having escaped Bruce’s influence. Simon Abrams Joel Schumacher’s lysergic, almost enjoyably appalling Batman & Robin – the Bat-movie least likely to appear elsewhere in this article – was both a blessing and a curse for Christopher Nolan. On the one hand, when the then-hotshot writer-director of sleeper hits Memento and Insomnia signed on to resurrect the franchise, Schumacher had set the bar so low that all Nolan had to do was make a film without Bat-nipples in it and it would be an improvement. On the other, Schumacher had taken any goodwill that somehow remained after Batman Forever, said “Ice to meet you,” and then flushed it down the toilet. An origin story for a superhero no one cared about any more? Why bother? Nolan’s pitch to Warner Bros executives only lasted 15 minutes, which is indicative of the focused, brilliantly singular film it produced. Batman Begins did the impossible: answering the question “how does a billionaire playboy become a face-pummelling, chiroptera-stanning martial-artist vigilante” in a manner that’s logical, even believable, grounding Gotham City in general and Bruce Wayne in particular like no Bat-film before, shorn of the funereally frilly, wink-wink indulgences of Tim Burton or Schumacher’s neon plasticity. Christian Bale was perfectly cast (yes, even with the silly voice), the action was robust and moody, the story twisted and yawed until the final epic showdown, and it isn’t an overstuffed, three-hour delusion of grandeur like the two films that followed it. Everything about Batman Begins just works. This, more than any other, is the film R-Patz has to beat. Luke Holland It’s impossible to look back on Christopher Nolan’s glum 2008 sequel without an exhausted eye-roll, it being the superhero film that unfortunately inspired an unending glut of unbearably self-serious emo imitators. But it’s also impossible not to rewatch it without seeing exactly why it became so wildly influential, a sleek but punishing upgrade of what we had come to expect from a Batman movie. Sure, Batman Begins had already introduced Nolan’s new, straight-faced universe, a world away from the codpiece camp of Joel Schumacher’s fun and flashy fripperies, but it was a flawed introduction, hemmed in by some slightly laborious world-building, an aggressively underwhelming lead villain and … Katie Holmes. The Dark Knight was freer, if still tightly controlled, and gave us both a better bad guy (in Heath Ledger’s terrifying Joker, an unpredictable and unbridled agent of pure chaos) and love interest (Maggie Gyllenhaal adding some texture to Bruce’s doomed childhood sweetheart Rachel). It was a shocking jolt at the time, and still remains so, staggering for how far Nolan was willing and able to take a film of this scale (without seemingly being micromanaged by studio execs), an unusually nihilistic PG-13 provocation that wrestled with weighty, unresolved issues but, unlike those that came after, did it without a heavy hand. Because importantly, nestled alongside the dour grisliness, was a string of dazzling, seat-clenching action set pieces, Nolan smartly playing to all seats. The poorly calibrated murk of the Snyderverse wouldn’t exist without it but The Dark Knight proves that it’s a price worth paying. Benjamin Lee The Dark Knight Rises may well be the ugly sister of Nolan’s Batman trilogy – but for all its flaws it is hard to resist the ludicrous bombast on display, all accompanied by Hans Zimmer’s honking score. In truth it shares more in common with Adam West’s iteration of the Caped Crusader than the supposed “grounded” take that Christian Bale was embodying. From the nonsensical plot of the villain – a neutron bomb used to hold Gotham island hostage for … reasons – to the absurdity of Tom Hardy’s Bane, with his barely audible mumbling behind his mask endlessly amusing; and the Scooby Doo reveal of the real big bad, Rises ditches the realism in favour of spectacle. And isn’t that what we want from our superhero films? Sure, the treatment of Catwoman isn’t ideal (goggles that flip up to look like cat ears, really?) and the ease with which Alfred abandons his charge is entirely out of character, but for every misstep there’s something to enjoy. The Broken Bat finally translated to the silver screen; Cillian Murphy’s Scarecrow sending the rich to their deathly exile on the icy river from his kangaroo court; we even got Robin (sort of). And the coup de grace, in what was surely a tribute to the first Batman big screen outing in 1966, we have the world’s greatest detective scrabbling to dispose of a nuke over the water that surrounds Gotham – and apparently dying in the process. Indeed, some days you just can’t get rid of a bomb. Toby Moses For geeks of a certain age, the definitive Batman graphic novel will always be The Dark Knight Returns, written and drawn by Frank Miller in 1986. And the closest thing we will ever get to a big-budget Hollywood adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns is not Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, or even The Dark Knight Rises. No, that honour goes to Zack Snyder’s dystopian Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Admittedly, you have to do a little mental editing. You have to imagine that Jesse Eisenberg is playing the Joker rather than Lex Luthor, and that the alien zombie has been cut out altogether. But a good proportion of the film is pinched from Miller’s tale: the hefty, short-eared Batsuit design, the vicious Bats-versus-Supes punch-up, Alfred’s waspish wit and, most importantly, the obsessive, ruthless central character. For once, Batman actually resembles the towering tough guy in the comics. Well over six feet tall, Ben Affleck looks as if a) he could beat all of the other Bat-actors to a pulp, and b) he might even enjoy it. Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy may have borrowed Miller’s title, but Batman v Superman is the only film to have a properly dark Dark Knight. Nicholas Barber",Arts/Culture,Kapow!

3/4/2022,"After four vicious storms in as many weeks and the worst drought in 40 years, there are fears that the hunger crisis facing 2 million people in southern Madagascar could become a famine. With record low rainfalls in the Grand Sud region, USAid’s Famine Early Warning Network is warning that large-scale humanitarian support will be needed until next year. Food shortages have been compounded by three cyclones and one tropical storm that have ravaged parts of the south and east of the country since late January. The most recent hit the south-east coast on 22 February, affecting thousands of people. Among them is Vokasoa Origin, 24, who walked 11 miles (17km) overnight to reach a mobile clinic in Elomaka village in Amboasary Sud district, to collect emergency supplements for her seven-year-old daughter, Bakoly. At home, her husband and their two other children forage for food – mostly cactus fruits. Their last two harvests have been destroyed by drought. “Our situation is tough, especially when our crop fails,” says Origin. “I wanted to give another life to my children.” The mobile clinic, run by Médecins Sans Frontières, visits Elomaka twice a month to distribute food supplements to children. The UN children’s agency, Unicef, estimates that 500,000 children under five will be acutely malnourished this year and about 110,000 will be severely malnourished. On a sweltering day last week, about 100 children lined up with their parents waiting to be seen by medical staff. Against the odds, Bakoly is the only one of Origin’s children who meets the threshold for food relief. “At least now she does not have to be hungry,” says Origin. In Ambovombe district, Dr Higor Rodrigues Machado oversees a packed clinic and feeding centre. “In many villages, one child out of 10 dies due to lack of food and respiratory diseases. Infants coming here don’t know how to eat. They lack the reflexes and have to be taught,” says Machado, the head doctor at the clinic, run by the NGO Fraternity Without Borders. Toendrazae Emiliene brought her one-month-old son, Mahasolo Philibert, to the clinic three weeks ago because she was unable to produce milk to feed him. “In the beginning, when we were here, I thought my son would die,” says Emiliene. Emiliene’s mother, Claudine, sitting next to her daughter in the clinic, praises God that Mahasolo is getting better now he has been given baby formula. Claudine says their problems began about five years ago. “We got less rain and sandstorms came more often. Then I was a rich woman. “Today it is difficult. If there was no help with food, we would have died,” she says. Unpredictable rain has been a problem for as long as people can remember. But now deforestation – 80% of Madagascar’s original rainforest has been cut down – and soil degradation are leading to a problem that some consider worse than drought: dust and sandstorms known as Tiomena (red wind) that are exacerbating the crisis in the far south by smothering crops, forests, buildings and roads. The wind “destroys everything”, says Dominique Raherinidamy, a leader of Zambey Abkilidonga village, in Amboasary Sud. “We prefer the drought instead of the red wind. “People have left the village to go east in order to survive, although this is ancestral land where we have always stayed,” he says. These violent sandstorms can arrive three or four times a month, burying fields under a thick layer of sand and ruining crops, he says. Once the sand has covered the farms, it is difficult to use the land again for further planting as all the sand has to be removed manually. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is attempting to address the crisis with projects to protect farmland in the Grand Sud region. “A part of the solution to this situation is access to water, higher-quality seeds and protection of the farmlands,” says Mattias Ravelondralambo, a regional environmental manager for FAO. In three years, Ambondro village in Ambovombe district has been transformed from a barren, dusty landscape, weathered by sandstorms, into a green oasis, thanks to a new well and drought-resistant crops planted behind rows of bushes and trees that form a natural barrier of protection. “Some years ago, we starved here, especially 2006, but now we can survive, even with little and no rain. And the sandstorms don’t affect our lives as much as before,” says Mamonjeazye, leader of a co-operative farm in the village. But for Origin and Bakoly, there is little to do but hope the March rains come and the family can harvest the last of their cassava crop. “It is terrible as a mother to not be able to feed your children,” says Origin, before starting the long walk back home from Elomaka in the scorching sun.

3/4/2022,"Setting daily meat reduction goals and keeping an online diary of intake helped frequent meat eaters to halve their consumption in just over nine weeks, a trial has found. The trial, by researchers at the University of Oxford’s Livestock, Environment and People (Leap) programme, also found the routine was popular with participants, who felt it supported them to change their diet. Many people wish to reduce their meat consumption, whether for health or environmental reasons, or animal welfare concerns. Leap researchers wondered whether tapping into psychological principles employed by weight-loss apps, such as Noom, could help boost participants’ resolve. They developed an online platform called the Optimise meat tracker (standing for online programme to tackle individuals’ meat intake through self-regulation). Users log on and pick one meat reduction strategy from a list to focus on for that day, such as “try a new vegetarian recipe”, or “eat no processed meat”. The next morning they report whether they achieved this and record how much fish, poultry, red and processed meat they consumed. They receive weekly feedback on how they have done. The approach is based on self-regulation theory: the idea that people monitor and contextualise their own behaviour, reflect on it in relation to their goals, and try to modify it in response to feedback. “We know that people tend to underestimate the amount of meat they eat, the health and environmental impacts of their meat consumption; we also know that our meat-eating habits are strongly engrained. This process of self-regulation tries to tap into all of that,” said Dr Cristina Stewart at the University of Oxford, who led the research. To test the theory, researchers recruited 151 British adults who ate meat at least five times a week but wanted to reduce their consumption. The participants tracked their daily meat intake during a baseline week, and received feedback on the health and environmental impact. Half of them were then instructed to use the app for four weeks, followed by a second month when they were asked to carry on trying to reduce their meat consumption on their own. The other group was given no further guidance on how to reduce their meat consumption, although everyone completed further food diaries during weeks five and nine.  1. Make at least one of your main meals vegetarian 2. Double the veg, halve the meat 3. Eat no red meat 4. Set yourself a maximum number of animal products to consume today 5. Eat no processed meat 6. Try a new vegetarian recipe Both groups reduced their meat consumption substantially. The intervention group reduced their daily intake from 221g a day (the equivalent of two average sized burgers or three to four sausages) to 96g after the first month (a 57% reduction), and to 107g after the second month (a 52% reduction). Stewart said: “There were really small, manageable strategies, which showed us that reducing your meat intake doesn’t have to be really daunting or happen overnight: small reductions add up.” Surprisingly, the control group also reduced their daily intake from 231g to 122g after two months, a 47% reduction. “It looks like the requirement for them to track their meat intake during the baseline and follow-up weeks, combined with the information we gave them at the start of the study, acted as an intervention itself,” said Stewart, whose results were published in the European Journal of Nutrition. “Many participants mentioned in their feedback that the self-monitoring aspect was an eye-opener and made them realise they ate much more meat than they realised, and that they found this particularly motivating.” Stewart’s team has since finished a second study involving meat eaters of all levels, which produced similar results. The Optimise website is available for people to use, and Leap researchers are discussing its future development.",Lifestyle/Food,"Weight-loss techniques can halve meat consumption, Oxford trial finds",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/04/weight-loss-techniques-can-halve-meat-consumption-oxford-trial-finds
3/4/2022,"When David Fisman tweets, he often receives a deluge of hate within moments of posting. Fisman, an epidemiologist and physician, has been outspoken about Covid and public health. Even when he tweets something innocuous – once, to test his theory, he wrote the banal statement “kids are remarkable” – he still receives a flood of angry pushback. But in recent days, Fisman noticed an “astounding” trend, he said. He posted about topics like requiring vaccination and improving ventilation to prevent the spread of Covid – and the nasty responses never came. No support for the trucker convoy, no calls to try the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for treason. Others have observed the same phenomenon; those who frequently encounter bots or angry responses are now seeing a significant drop-off. Covid misinformation, which has often trended on social media over the past two years, seems to be taking a nosedive. The reasons for this “bot holiday”, as Fisman calls it, are probably varied – but many of them point to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s information war with western nations seems to be pivoting to new fronts, from vaccines to geopolitics. And while social media has proven a powerful tool for Ukraine – with images of Zelenskiy striding through the streets of Kyiv and tractors pulling abandoned Russian tanks – growing campaigns of misinformation around the world could change the conflict’s narrative, and the ways the world reacts. The likely reasons for the shift in online chatter are many. Russia began limiting access to Twitter on Saturday, sanctions have been levied against those who could be financing disinformation sites and bot farms, and social media companies are more attuned to banning bots and accounts spreading misinformation during the conflict. But something more coordinated may also be at play. Conspiracy theories around the so-called “New World Order” – loosely defined conspiracies about shadowy global elites that run the world – have converged narrowly on Ukraine, according to emerging research. “There’s actually been a doubling of New World Order conspiracies on Twitter since the invasion,” said Joel Finkelstein, the chief science officer and co-founder of the National Contagion Research Institute, which maps online campaigns around public health, economic issues and geopolitics. At the same time, “whereas before the topics were very diverse – it was Ukraine and Canada and the virus and the global economy – now the entire conversation is about Ukraine,” he said. “We’re seeing a seismic shift in the disinformation sphere towards Ukraine entirely.” Online activity has surged overall by 20% since the invasion, and new hashtags have cropped up around Ukraine that seem to be coordinated with bot-like activity, Finkelstein said. Users pushing new campaigns frequently tweet hundreds of times a day and can catch the eye of prominent authentic accounts. “We can’t say for certain that Russia is behind this or that it contributes directly to the propagation of these messages. But it’s pretty difficult to believe that it’s not involved,” Finkelstein said, with topics strikingly similar to Russian talking points about the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, being controlled by the west and the need to dissolve Nato. A Russian bot farm reportedly produced 7,000 accounts to post fake information about Ukraine on social media, including Telegram, WhatsApp and Viber, according to the security service of Ukraine. And influencers who previously demonstrated against vaccines are now turning their support to Russia. Social media users may see a topic trending and not realize its connection to conspiracy theories or disinformation campaigns, said Esther Chan, Australia bureau editor for First Draft, an organization that researches misinformation. “A lot of social media users may just use these terms because they’re trending, they sound good,” she said. “It’s a very clever sort of astroturfing strategy that we’ve seen in the past few years.” The topics pushed by troll farms and Russian state media are often dictated by Russian officials, said Mitchell Orenstein, a professor of Russian and east European studies at University of Pennsylvania and a senior fellow of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. In this case, it seems “their orders got changed because priorities shifted”, he said. Russia has coordinated significant misinformation campaigns to destabilize western countries, including topics like the 2016 election and the pandemic, according to several reports. Inauthentic accounts are not fully responsible for real hesitations and beliefs. But they amplify harmful messages and make pushback seem more widespread than it is. “They’ve had tremendous success with social media platforms,” Orenstein said. “They play a pretty substantial role and they do shift people’s perception about what opinion is.” Fake accounts will frequently link to “pink slime” or low-credibility sites that once carried false stories about the pandemic and are now shifting focus to Ukraine, said Kathleen Carley, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “The bots themselves don’t create news – they’re more used for amplification,” she said. These sites frequently sow division on controversial issues, research finds, and they make it more difficult to spot disinformation online. The escalation of narratives like these could have wide-ranging consequences for policy. “Right now, we’re in the beginning of a war that has a consensus, right? It’s clear that what Russia’s doing is against the moral order of the modern world. But as the war becomes prolonged, and people become exhausted, that may change,” Finkelstein said. As “we enter into more unknown territory, these narratives will have a chance to grow … it gives us a window into what these themes are going to be like.” The research around these changing campaigns is limited, looking at thousands of tweets in the early days of an invasion, Carley cautioned. It’s very early to understand what direction the misinformation is going and who is behind it – and conspiracies tend to follow current events even when there aren’t coordinated campaigns. And “that does not mean that all the disinformation, all the conspiracy theories about Covid are not still there,” she said. “I would not say the bots are on holiday. They have been re-targeted at different stories now, but they’ll be back.” Misinformation campaigns around the New World Order can quickly morph depending on the target, giving them more longevity than some other conspiracy theories. “They probably will still exist for a long time,” Chan said. “The question for us is whether they would have an impact on people – on real life and also on policymaking.” It may be too soon to say what’s emerging during the invasion of Ukraine, but leaders should understand what terms are emerging in conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns so they don’t inadvertently signal support for the theories in their public statements, she said. “They need to take note of what terms are commonly used and try to avoid them,” Chan said. A global agreement on how to address misinformation or disinformation would be key, Carley said. “Each country does it separately. And the thing is, because we’re all connected very tightly throughout the world in social media, it doesn’t matter that one country has some strong reactions because it’ll still go from another country’s machines on to your machines,” she said. Such rules would also need to have teeth to prevent further campaigns, she said. And educating the public about how to parse misinformation and disinformation is also important. “We need to start investing better in critical thinking and digital media literacy.”",News/Media,‘Bot holiday’: Covid disinformation down as social media pivot to Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/bot-holiday-covid-misinformation-ukraine-social-media
3/4/2022,"More than a billion people around the world will be obese by 2030 – double the number there was in 2010, according to new global estimates. No country is on track to meet the World Health Organization’s (WHO) target to halt obesity by 2025, with one in five women and one in seven men predicted to have the condition by 2030. Obesity has been rising fastest in low- and middle-income countries. Over the next eight years, the number of people with obesity is predicted to triple in low-income countries, compared with 2010. The new figures come from the fourth World Obesity Atlas, published on Friday, and produced by the World Obesity Federation. Its chief executive, Johanna Ralston, said political and health leaders needed to recognise the gravity of the situation and act. “The numbers in our report are shocking, but what is even more shocking is how inadequate our response has been. Everyone has a basic right to prevention, treatment and management access which works for them. Now is the time for joined-up, decisive and people-centred action to turn the tide on obesity,” she said. The highest rates of obesity are found in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean. Almost half of people (47%) in the US are likely to be obese by 2030. However, while obesity rates in the region are predicted to increase by 50% between 2010 and 2030, numbers in Africa are expected to triple, with more women affected than men. Obesity – when a person’s body mass index (BMI) is more than 30 – was found to be a major contributor to Covid-19 deaths. An estimated 74 million women in Africa will be living with obesity in 2030, compared with 26 million in 2010, and 27 million men in 2030, up from 8 million in 2010. In South Africa, half of women are predicted to be obese by 2030, according to the report, and in Algeria almost a third of men (30%). Almost a quarter (22%) of preventable deaths from non-communicable diseases in Africa are attributed to being overweight. The region is still dealing with high rates of malnutrition. Last month, the World Food Programme warned an estimated 13 million people are waking up severely hungry every day in the Horn of Africa, as the region grapples with a major drought. Dr Adelheid Onyango, at the WHO’s regional office for Africa, said while the biggest problem across the continent is undernutrition, “we cannot close our eyes to [obesity] any more. It is already recognised as a public health problem”. “Our obesity rates have been low in the past, so the incremental growth will be dramatic because of that. “We are seeing a shift in the consumption of unhealthy diets,” she added. Policies and regulatory systems around processed, high fat and sugary foods are weak in many countries across the continent and drivers for obesity have a fertile ground compared to more developed regions, where there is more regulation and public awareness, she said. The World Obesity Atlas also ranks countries in terms of their preparedness for obesity, including their health systems. The most prepared are high-income countries, while the least prepared are all lower middle- and low-income countries, adding to concerns about the impact of obesity on already vulnerable populations. More than 150 health experts and advocates have written to health ministers calling for an international action plan to tackle obesity.",News/Global development,Obesity rates likely to double by 2030 with highest rises in lower-income countries,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/04/obesity-rates-likely-to-double-by-2030-with-highest-rises-in-lower-income-countries
3/4/2022,"As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, some hosts at the rightwing Fox News channel were passionately defending Vladimir Putin. Once Russian troops were in Ukraine, those same personalities, such as Tucker Carlson, swiftly began to blame Joe Biden for the invasion. That will not have surprised regular viewers of Fox, but what has raised eyebrows is the way that the views of hosts such as Carlson, the crew at the morning show Fox & Friends, and the opinions of multiple Fox News guests have been corrected often in real time, by one of Fox News’ own journalists Time and again over the past few days Jennifer Griffin, Fox News’ national security correspondent, has taken to the airwaves to directly contradict the messages of her colleagues and their guests. One former US brigadier general was dismissed on air by Griffin as “not a student of history”, after he agitated for American intervention in Ukraine. A former military adviser to Donald Trump was described as a Putin “apologist” after suggesting Russia should be allowed to get on with subsuming Ukraine. It has brought Griffin, a widely respected journalist who joined Fox News in 1996 and spent three years as a reporter in Moscow, to the fore in the US, as non-Fox News viewers have been buoyed by her blunt dismissals. Last week Griffin had already corrected Fox & Friends’ Steve Doocy and lectured the Fox News host Harris Faulkner about how Joe Biden stationing troops at Ukraine’s border would have given Putin “a pretext to go into Ukraine”, but the veteran journalist stepped it up in recent days as she apparently lost patience with the opinions of some of the Fox News punditocracy. Griffin’s first target was Don Bolduc, a retired army brigadier general who is running, for the second time, for the US Senate in New Hampshire. Bolduc, a vocal Trump supporter who has advanced the conspiracy theory that the former president won the 2020 election, appeared on Fox News on Saturday where he pushed for greater US military intervention in Ukraine. Enter Griffin. “I have to respond to something your previous guest, Brigadier General Bolduc, said, because he really was way off the mark in terms of talking about what the US could do on the ground,” she said. “Putin has nuclear weapons. That is why the US military and Nato do not have troops on the ground inside Ukraine.” Griffin continued: “Clearly, Brigadier General Bolduc is not a student of history – he’s a politician, he ran for Senate in New Hampshire and failed. He’s not a military strategist, and to suggest that the US would put indirect fire or special operations or CIA on the ground to give Putin any sort of excuse to broaden this conflict is extremely dangerous talk at a time like this.” The Bolduc burn came after Griffin had already stymied Sean Hannity’s efforts, two days before Russia’s invasion, to blame the crisis on Biden. “Sean, how we got to this point is a long story and it predates the Biden administration,” she said. “It goes back and includes mistakes made by every US president since the Soviet Union fell apart.” As Griffin’s reputation grew, she was asked about her fact-checking efforts on the Fox News show Media Buzz on Sunday. Howard Kurtz, the show’s host, referenced a Washington Post article headlined: “Jennifer Griffin keeps fact-checking her Fox News colleagues on Ukraine.” Kurtz said: “Now, I read that as you don’t want to get drawn into opinion debates. How do you see your role during this war?” Griffin, who joined Fox News in 1996, said: “I cover the news.” She added: “I’m here to fact-check facts because I report on facts. And my job is to try and figure out the truth as best as I know it. I share those facts internally so that our network can be more accurate. That’s what I’ve always done.” Hours after the Media Buzz appearance, Griffin was forced to return to the fact-checking, during an appearance on Trey Gowdy’s Fox News show. Gowdy, a former Republican congressman, had just been chatting with his guest, the former Trump military adviser Doug Macgregor, and Griffin had some thoughts. “I feel like I need to correct some of the things that Col Douglas Macgregor said, and I’m not sure that 10 minutes is enough time to do so, because there were so many distortions,” Griffin began. Macgregor, a former army colonel, had confidently told Gowdy that Putin had no intention of invading any other countries, and said the Russian president was merely “carrying through on something that he has been warning us about at least for the last 15 years”. Macgregor claimed that Russians and Ukrainians were “indistinguishable” from one another, and when asked whether Russia should be allowed to take as much of Ukraine as he likes, Macgregor said: “Yes, absolutely.” Griffin came on air and swiftly accused Macgregor of sounding like a Putin “apologist”: because “there were so many distortions in what he just said”. ​​“I don’t think anyone I’ve spoken to at the Pentagon or elsewhere in western intelligence believes they know how far Putin wants to go,” she said. Griffin said that Macgregor, when an adviser to the Trump administration, had supported pulling US troops out of Germany. “That kind of projection of withdrawal and weakness is what made Putin think that he could actually move into a sovereign country like Ukraine,” she said. With no end to the Russian invasion in sight, it seems like Griffin will continue to have her work cut out for her. That was illustrated on Tuesday night when Carlson, Fox News’ most-watched host, wheeled Macgregor back on to the network and appeared to take a veiled swipe at Griffin. Carlson, whose recent defense of Putin was played on Russia 1 as Putin made his case to the Russian public for war, gave Macgregor the red carpet treatment, lavishing praise on the recently humbled former military man. “Unlike so many of the TV generals you see all day long, Macgregor is not angling for a board seat at Raytheon,” the Daily Beast quoted Carlson as saying. “Unlike many of the so-called reporters you see on television, he is not acting secretly as a flack for Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon. No, Doug Macgregor is an honest man.” After a brief interview with Macgregor, where the under-fire guest criticized Nato and questioned the amount of money being spent on supporting Ukraine, Carlson turned to the camera. “Doug Macgregor. A man you can believe,” Carlson said, defying Griffin’s earlier analysis that suggested quite the opposite.",News/Media,The Fox News journalist fact-checking channel’s pundits on air over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/jennifer-griffin-fox-news-fact-checking-ukraine
3/4/2022,"As dementia invades Ptolemy Grey’s consciousness, the early stages of this series are a heartbreaking depiction of this cruel illness. His only lifeline is his patient carer Reggie – but when Reggie is killed, Ptolemy is left in the hands of orphaned teenager Robyn. What happened to Reggie? Using treatment that restores his memories to an almost absurd pin-sharpness, Ptolemy is able to scroll back through the events leading to Reggie’s death with unnerving certainty. Based on Walter Mosley’s novel, this drama is part detective story, part muse on memory and what it really means. Samuel L Jackson brings its frail but defiant hero to life with sensitivity.Apple TV+, from Friday 11 March The ludicrous and rakishly enjoyable time-travelling historical epic returns for a sixth season. Caitríona Balfe’s Claire – who, now reaching her 60s, should be enjoying a relaxed married life in 18th-century North Carolina with Jamie (Sam Heughan) – knows all too well about the impending revolutionary war (she is from the future). And a ghost from Jamie’s past returns to add to these anxieties. What lies ahead for the trouble-magnet pair? Certainly plenty of sex – this show is unapologetically libidinous – but also, tentative steps to establishing a society that may or may not be doomed to fail.Starzplay, from Sunday 6 March The smart, inventive and occasionally bewildering sci-fi cartoon – which feels, in its more psychedelic moments, like Futurama reimagined by George Saunders – returns with more space-time continuum-mangling action. Expect adventures in mind transference, journeys into parallel universes, the destruction of the US constitution and a ton of pop-culture references as our ill-matched but lovable heroes (Rick is a misanthropic alcoholic scientist, Morty is his awkward, anxious grandson) continue to traverse space.Netflix, from Sunday 6 March The cheering life transformation show gets its first ever international spin-off as a brand new Fab Five take the shy, the scruffy, the stuck and the forlorn and add some spice to their lives.

Get ready to meet work-life coach Leni Bolt, fashion expert Jan-Henrik Scheper-Stuke, beauty guru David Jakobs, nutrition and health don Aljosha Muttardi and design king Ayan Yuruk. The formula remains the same: tough love, heartfelt encouragement, a few tears and charm to burn.Netflix, from Wednesday 9 March This striking six-part series by Ryan Murphy is notable for using AI to render diary readings in an approximation of Warhol’s voice. Given his fascination with notions of authenticity and uniqueness – along with his notorious emotional distance – Warhol himself would surely have approved. The picture that emerges is enigmatic and none the worse for it. Warhol was clearly both a beloved figure and a troubled one. “I’m just a freak,” he says, disarmingly. “I wasn’t very close to anyone.” This might be the closest we ever manage to get to the man himself.Netflix, from Wednesday 9 March This reboot of the Charles M Schulz cartoon is both instantly recognisable and significantly tweaked. The animations are incredibly faithful to both the original strips and the first TV renderings. But the narratives foreground Snoopy and his avian pal Woodstock ahead of the human characters (the clue is in the title, really). This points the show more in the direction of children – the melancholic, gently philosophical edge of the originals is largely absent here. It’s nicely realised but slightly less than the sum of its parts.Apple TV+, from Friday 11 March Depending on your point of view, this show will either be a revelatory and moving journey through the afterlife, or an offensive and borderline dangerous exercise in manipulating the emotionally vulnerable. Henry is best known as the medium who gave a reading to one of the Kardashian sisters in Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

3/4/2022,"Former NRL player Sam Burgess has been hit with a $30,000 fine after a lengthy investigation conducted by the league found he had breached multiple rules during his time as a South Sydney player and official. Burgess, who retired at the end of 2019 due to a chronic shoulder problem but continued his involvement with the Rabbitohs in a coaching capacity, also received a suspension from any official club duty for 12 weeks. But the league said there was insufficient available evidence to support domestic violence allegations. An NRL statement on Friday said the 33-year-old had “breached its code of conduct by taking illicit drugs in 2018, threatening another rugby league player in 2018 and breaching NSW law in February 2021 by driving a motor vehicle with traces of an illicit drug in his system”. Burgess issued a statement saying he understood but did not agree with all of the breach notices issued by the NRL. In an Instagram post, he labelled his punishment “grossly unfair” but indicated he would not appeal out of a desire to “move on with my life”. The sanctions come following the conclusion of NSW Police Strike Force Irrabella which was launched to investigate allegations of domestic violence and drug abuse made against Burgess by his ex-wife Phoebe. Strike Force Irrabella concluded late last year that Burgess would not face charges over the allegations, and the NRL on Friday also said it did not have sufficient evidence to support the allegations of domestic violence. “A number of allegations concerning Burgess’ personal relationships did not relate to the NRL’s rules,” the NRL noted. In his statement on Friday evening, Burgess said he stood strongly against violence towards women. “It has no place in society, no place in sport and no place in my life,” he said. “I am thankful the NRL have finally cleared my name against all allegations of domestic violence. “I have now been cleared of three very public and defamatory investigations. This has been a long and damaging process, taking a toll on me both physically and mentally.” Burgess stood himself down voluntarily in October 2020 and his suspension from club duties will can count that as time served, leaving him free to resume his role at the club should there be agreement between him and the club. The Rabbitohs were fined $20,000 for failing to promptly advise the NRL Integrity Unit of the allegations made against Burgess. The club released a statement saying it responded to the breach notice at the time and now accepts the fine that has been imposed. “The Rabbitohs wish to reiterate that there is no place in our society for violence, harassment or abuse against women,” the statement read. “The club also takes issues of drug use very seriously and has established policies and procedures in place around the use of drugs. The club works closely with the playing group to support their wellbeing and educate them about drug use, and also works closely with Sport Integrity Australia and the NRL who administer testing of the players.”",Sport/Sport,Sam Burgess fined by NRL for multiple breaches of code of conduct,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/sam-burgess-fined-by-nrl-for-multiple-breaches-of-code-of-conduct
3/4/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray with this morning’s top stories. Fire broke out at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant overnight after shelling from Russian forces. “Europe must wake up now,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accusing Vladimir Putin of “nuclear terrorism”. “The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units.” Ukrainian authorities later said the fire was extinguished and the reactors safe, but it underlined the dangers of a nuclear plant being caught up in the conflict. Joe Biden called Zelenskiy and the White House said the two leaders urged “Russia to cease its military activities in the area”. Boris Johnson also spoke with Zelenskiy and said the “reckless actions of president Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe”. The PM’s office said he was seeking an emergency UN security council meeting. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, said Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported normal radiation levels. He appealed for a ceasefire and warned of “severe danger” if the reactors were hit. On day nine of Putin’s war against Ukraine, Luke Harding tells this morning how demoralised Russian soldiers captured by the Ukrainians have told of their anger at being “duped” into war. “Frankly speaking, they tricked us,” an officer says under questioning. “Everything we were told was a fake. I would tell my guys to leave Ukrainian territory. We’ve got families and children. I think 90% of us would agree to go home.” The BBC’s website may have been blocked in Russia and it has brought back its shortwave radio service in Ukraine and Russia to ensure civilians can access news from outside. The BBC’s shortwave radio broadcast can be found on 15735 kHz from 6pm to 8pm and on 5875 kHz from midnight to 2am, Ukraine time.

Economy to slump – Britain’s economic growth will halve this year as a result of inflation, tax rises and the war in Ukraine, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says. It expects an inflation rate of 8% to cut disposable incomes, putting the brakes on the pandemic recovery, and interest rates to increase to 1.5%. The BCC says the size of the economy will surpass its pre-pandemic level over the next few months but it is likely to struggle as consumer confidence drops further. Business investment is forecast to grow at 3.5% instead of the BCC’s previously forecast 5.1% and “materially lower than the Bank of England’s latest projection of 13.75%”. There could be a drop in household real incomes of 3.1% in 2022 compared with a year earlier. “Our latest forecast signals a significant deterioration in the UK’s economic outlook,” said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC. Schools scrimp while academies hoard – Children’s education is being eroded by financial pressures triggering staff cuts and scaled-back curriculums, despite what the Department for Education says, according to parliament’s spending watchdog, the PAC. It says one in four secondaries has been forced into such cuts while, in contrast, some academy trusts have built up large reserves with a cumulative surplus of £3.1bn – money that is therefore not being spent on pupils’ immediate education, the report points out. The PAC has called on the education department to investigate whether such reserves are justified. Colleges in England, meanwhile, are facing their worst staffing crisis for two decades with 6,000 job vacancies, according to a report by the Association of Colleges. Trauma history of female offenders – The vast majority of vulnerable young women and girls in the criminal justice system have previously suffered abuse and violence, says the Young Women’s Justice Project report, published today. It cites greater prevalence of poor mental health among young women in the system compared with young men and older women; girls in custody self-harming at much higher rates than boys; while Black, Asian and other minority women and those with experience of the care system are significantly overrepresented in the system. The report calls for recognising and responding to the needs of women in the system, including needs specific to women from minorities and from care. The Ministry of Justice says that since its female offender strategy was launched in 2018 there has been a 30% drop in the number of women entering the criminal justice system. ‘Patch those servers’ – Employees should report suspicious emails rather than delete them and firms must step up vigilance against cyber-attacks in the face of a heightened threat from Russian hackers, as well as the general threat of cybercrime, the UK’s information commissioner, John Edwards, has said. Outside the Ukraine conflict, there had been a “steady and significant” increase in cyber-attacks against UK businesses over the past two years, he said. “It is a time for vigilance, for checking security settings and making sure those servers are patched and up to date, reminding staff of basic email hygiene and of scepticism to phishing attacks. And of the need of not just to curl your lip and hit delete but to notify your IT department and get these things blocked so one of your colleagues doesn’t inadvertently open the organisation to a vulnerability.” Streamlined stegosaur – A dinosaur with spine-like plates along its back is one of the earliest stegosaurs yet discovered, fossil hunters have revealed. Bashanosaurus primitivus is thought to have lived about 168m years ago. It is named partly for the ancient name of a region in China where it was found in 2016. The discovery makes it an early cousin of stegosaurus, which lived about 150m years ago and had a stocky build, spiked tail and huge, kite-shaped plates down its back. Dr Susannah Maidment, of the Natural History Museum in London and a co-author of the study, said Bashanosaurus would have looked rather different. “Bashanosaurus doesn’t have these great big flashy, massive giant plates – very, very thin plates – that stegosaurus has, it has much smaller plates, and they’re quite spine-like really.” It is thought Bashanosaurus measured about 2.8 metres in length – a relatively small size, although the team note it is not clear if the fossils are from an adult or juvenile.

3/4/2022,"When Jenni Metcalfe returned to her Brisbane home to survey the damage as the nearby river peaked, water had already risen a metre up the back wall. There was nothing she could do. “I sat in the gutter and watched it and cried,” she said. The east coast of Australia has been battered by more than a week of torrential rain, as communities begin to survey the wreckage of fatal flash flooding that has left townships looking like war zones. South-east Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales have borne the brunt of the “one in-1,000 year” catastrophic weather conditions, which have claimed at least 17 lives. Residents in the regional city of Lismore in north-eastern NSW are still reeling from the worst flooding in its history, which sent huge areas of the regional city underwater with the cleanup likely to last months, if not years. More than 700mm of rain fell in just 30 hours during the worst of the floods on Monday, forcing 43,000 residents to scramble onto their rooftops and wait to be rescued by emergency services crews. Four of the dead were in Lismore, people who were trapped in flooded homes or swept away while trying to escape. A number of the city’s residents remained missing. Among the devastation have been stories of heroism and kinship. World championship surfers Mick Fanning and Joel Parkinson spent Tuesday ferrying stranded residents and distributing supplies on their jet skis at badly hit Tumbulgum on the north coast of NSW. Emergency services volunteers saved dozens of elderly trapped in their homes and facilities, using boogie boards and dinghies to pull residents through windows and ferry them to safety. Others spent hours locating and mustering hundreds of livestock that were swept away in flood waters causing devastating losses for farmers already hit by drought and past flooding events. If lucky, the occasional cow turned up on beaches or rooftops. As the cleanup in Lismore began on Thursday, a harsh sun strengthened the stench of mud and sewage on the main street as business owners returned to their ruined shops where flood waters had crept up to the ceiling. Mark Bailey was one of them, forced to wade through a pile of ruined goods and furniture he estimated was worth $5m amassed at the front of his collectibles store, The Penny Man. “Everything in there’s fucked,” he told Guardian Australia, holding an album of vintage East German stamps that were dripping brown and unsalvageable. “I’m not mad at anyone in particular, every shop has a different story along here,” he said. “We won’t be reopening here, and I would be surprised if half of the street ever does.” Many businesses that went underwater, including Bailey’s, were uninsurable given their proximity to riverbanks and flood-prone areas. The cleanup had barely begun in large parts of south-east Queensland when residents were again forced to take cover due to more storms. The “rain bomb” that battered the capital city of Brisbane and surrounds until Monday killed 10 people and damaged more than 17,000 homes and businesses. Some 739mm of rain fell in just four days – nearly 75% of the annual average. On Friday, all schools in south-east Queensland closed except for children of essential workers in anticipation of further “extremely unstable” storms. That the floods hit the same week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report on the climate crisis, warning extreme weather events including floods were wreaking increasing damage, did not go unnoticed. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, warned Queenslanders were living through “unprecedented times”, a sentiment echoed by the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet. “I’ve lived in Brisbane essentially all my life and I haven’t seen storms and floods like this all being thrown at us at once,” she said. While flood waters in some parts of the country begin to recede, many Australians brace for another wave of water as the storm regroups and moves south towards Sydney. A sense of frustration and fatigue has set in. Some, like property owners in the lowlands of Richmond, north-west of Sydney, are still rebuilding from the last catastrophic floods that struck in March 2021. Many have yet to received promised government assistance. Pharmacist Skye Swift, who made headlines when Fanning ferried her to her chemist shop to distribute essential medicines to her community, is exhausted reflecting on the road to come. Telecommunications outages were hampering the recovery effort, and supermarkets were grappling with potential weeks-long shortages of fresh produce amid a burgeoning supply crisis. Swift told Guardian Australia the good news stories, the solidarity, was “beautiful, but not enough at the end of the day”. “We’ve now got weeks and months of rebuilding,” she said. “And how do you rebuild when you don’t have any money, a job? “It’s the aftermath that gets missed, that’s the heartbreaking part … it’s going to be a long road.”",News/Australia news,‘Heartbreaking’: Australia’s east coast reels from worst floods in living memory,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/heartbreaking-australias-east-coast-reels-from-worst-floods-in-living-memory
