3/5/2022,"Isee that you’ve waded into the area of impartiality in teaching, and your reason for this seems to be that some students are not fans of your boss, Boris Johnson. As reported by the BBC: “The education secretary says schools must not tackle political issues in a ‘partisan’ way after pupils were asked to write a letter that criticised the prime minister during a lesson.” Less than a fortnight later, you published new guidelines on “political impartiality in schools”. I thought, wow, that is speedy working. This must be really urgent … there must be some kind of giant hole in the guidance over at gov.uk where this matter has never been tackled before. I imagined you striding into one of the DfE offices, grabbing a group of fresh-faced Oxbridge graduates, snapping your fingers and saying: “There are kids in a Nottingham school complaining about Boris and the No 10 parties – which were of course totally within the guidelines at the time. I want you, you and you to tackle this. It’s all part of our pushback against the woke agenda.” (Maybe you didn’t say that last bit and you just thought it.) Then, in my imagination, one of them, their head full of seminars on logic and ideology, pipes up with: “But won’t this document itself be partial because it’s coming as a response to something partial?” “Of course not,” you snort. “Get on with it.” For all the years I’ve been observing the behaviour and actions of education secretaries, I have to confess that I am still often bewildered by what your job is for. Are you really employed by us to commission guidelines like this? I only ask, because they seem to have been produced without reference to what schools have already been doing under guidelines produced by your predecessors for many years. I’m not suggesting that this is easy territory to navigate, and it never has been. When I was about 15 – that would be some 60 years ago – I remember my father, a secondary school teacher, was always keen to know what homework I had been set, and would look over my shoulder. One time, he spotted that I was beavering away trying to explain a heading that I had been set: “Why Chartism failed”. He couldn’t stop himself. He burst out: “Failed? Did Chartism fail? Haven’t we got elections and trade unions? Didn’t the Chartists want that?” If I had been asked to answer the question “Did Chartism fail?” there might have been room for the points that my father made but, no. This was my first lesson in discovering that the things we call “topics” or “‘subjects” can be contentious in how they are framed. We might say metaphorically, if something is not on the table, you can’t eat it. Even so, no matter how difficult this matter is, you thought your time would be well spent wading in there. Out of interest, did you glance at the legislation and guidelines already in place? Or were you more concerned to make a splash in the anti-woke press than to sit in your office Googling what was already in your own departmental files? If you had, you might have found, for example, that the Education Act of 1996 forbids the promotion of “partisan political views in the teaching of any subject in the school” (Section 406) and requires that when political issues are discussed, pupils are “offered a balanced presentation of opposing views” (Section 407). Then again, Teachers’ Standards (DfE, 2011) states that teachers must ensure that “personal beliefs are not expressed in ways which exploit pupils’ vulnerability or might lead them to break the law”. Meanwhile, young people of all ages are watching TV, listening to the radio and talking with their parents – just as I did all those years ago. Terrible scenes of death, destruction and mass flight are in their living rooms right now. And then there are issues that young people care deeply about and deserve to discuss. Last summer, the England football manager, in consultation with his players, made the decision that the players would “take the knee” to demonstrate support for the Black Lives Matter movement. The behaviour of the Metropolitan police towards women has come under immense scrutiny. Depending on the age of school student, you acknowledge that there are times in the school week when schools can provide a safe environment for these kinds of topics to be talked about. You said that “no subject is off-limits in the classroom”, as long as it is treated with “sensitivity” and without “promoting contested theories as fact”. I know this all gets very philosophical, but aren’t all facts contested by someone somewhere? I don’t think this matter can be solved with a document hastily bashed out in the wake of what you perceive to be the terrible business of children criticising our great leader. When you feel the itch to demand that schools do something, why don’t you try working with groups of teachers on it? Not just hand-picked ones, but teachers who offer a range of views, some of which you might disagree with. A bit like a classroom, debating a topic. Just an idea.

3/5/2022,"As the world turned dark this week, with that sudden, seasick sideways lurch into subs and silos and nuclear threat, it became necessary to stop listening to sports radio, watching sports news TV and following online sports feeds, mainly to avoid the very real prospect of accidentally hearing about the end of the world from Ray Parlour. This is by no means a criticism of Ray, who seems like a lovely bloke and who would probably be excellent company as the sky flashes white and fire storms consume the horizon. There’s never really a bad time for an anecdote about being dropped for calling Gareth Southgate “big nose” in a team meeting. Hold my hand, Ray. Now do the one about Robert Pires smoking. It is a common phenomenon these days to hear about major news events from the most random of digital sources. I mentioned this on social media a couple of days ago and the replies were predictably good. The Twitter user who heard about the shooting of Osama bin Laden from Phil Neville. The moment TalkSport radio broke the news of the death of Keith Flint (“they went to Danny Murphy for reaction”). Another person who discovered the result of the Brexit referendum from Greggs the baker admin. This is the way of things now. The end of world will arrive not with a bang or a whimper, but with a cat meme, a shocked face emoji and an argument about Nadine Dorries. The main problem, at this point, is that the end of the world is big. It feels like a genuine story, deserving of a proper buildup. I suppose I’d always imagined a Maitlis, an Alagiah, a final Dimbleby. As opposed to a segment where Danny Mills discusses pre-emptive multicity thermonuclear assault (“not for me”) or Alan Brazil tries to rationalise the detonation of a 100-megaton device over the North Sea (“what you ask for is consistency”). Although to be fair, I’d take a ruminative Tony Cascarino. Perhaps he could compare it to his experiences of playing in France. Is it OK to make jokes about this? Probably not. Although, I am old enough remember the last time there was a similar sense of instant apocalypse in the air, through the 1980s. In between the fear and paranoia, and aside from useful acts that can actually have an affect, it is quite useful to take your mind off this. Plus, it has been hard to avoid the absurdity of viewing these events though a sporting lens. We have grown so accustomed to this. The past three decades have seen sport expand across every surface. As David Goldblatt has pointed out, football is the popular culture now, a rolling global leisure industry that crowds out every other form of shared discourse. Hence when events in the real world intrude, sport will continue to interpret them through that prism, inserting its own loss of scale, the digressions into land war in Europe bookended with the words “and now on to golf”, the apparently unshakeable belief that what’s really happening here is a story about the venue for this season’s Champions League final. We have seen genuine confusion between the roles of Fifa and Nato, an assumption that what the wretched Gianni Infantino does now is of any consequence as death rains down on 40 million people, as though Vladimir Putin has spent his time pacing the Kremlin, checking his Twitter feed, saying things like: “We’re still in the Europa Conference. Activate the second battalion.” And yet things did feel a little different by the end of the week. There is always a fear of falling into empty-gesture politics, a need to resist shows of enabling faux-concern. Fair play on this front to Amanda Staveley, who didn’t insult her audience by pretending to be in the slightest bit concerned with soft power complicity in bloodshed and war when she spoke at the Financial Times’s sports conference, saving her sympathy instead for the trials of Roman Abramovich. The real sportswashing move here would have been to semaphore bogus and meaningless concern. Not to give a genuine glimpse of that hard and very chilly reality. But in between there was a feeling the sports media, while absurdly overblown and weirdly balanced, was doing a pretty good job with some of this. I heard Trevor Sinclair on TalkSport asking a Ukrainian politician how long the Kyiv resistance could hope to hang on before they were, in effect, annihilated – cutting straight to the point and drawing a heartfelt response that would probably not have otherwise reached its daytime audience. A bit later Sky Sports News had Andriy Shevchenko looking into the camera and broadcasting a message directly to the people of Russia, even as the scrolling text around his haunted, hollow-eyed visage spoke of Livingston versus Celtic and Katie Boulter retiring injured in the first round of the Lyon Open, a mind-boggling mashup of frivolous trimmings and deeply serious content. And yes, sport has spent the last two decades taking the money and asking no questions, lost in a dream of no consequences and no strings, from which we must all wake up – from sport to finance, politics, law and enthusiastic consumers. There may be a correction now as the edges are trimmed from this vivid fantasy world. But there is some worth in all this too. Putin has already shown us the power of messaging, reach and the ability to communicate simply. His power is based on projection, show, iconography, the sense that Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible. Nobody really knows the limits of these things, the way the digital networking of every single human on the planet can affect how events play out. If sport really is the culture for most people then, who knows, maybe flags and solidarity, not to mention expulsion and boycotts, really can have an effect. Big sport may have been played like a sucker. But there is no reason those same channels can’t carry another kind of message. There is still time to connect, and to repay a little of that debt.",Sport/Football, Sport can repay its debt and prove its worth at a time of gloom and fear | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/sport-can-repay-its-debt-and-prove-its-worth-at-a-time-of-gloom-and-fear
3/5/2022,"There is always something fascinating about seeing people a few notches below their usual standards, like watching Barcelona in the Europa League or Joe Biden’s cameo in the TV comedy Parks and Recreation. The Queen opened a motorway service station near Bolton in 1970, and it was essential viewing. And so, the chance to watch Roberto Carlos, one of the best left-backs football has had, play Sunday League in Shrewsbury was too good to miss. Unlike the Queen, Carlos is not wearing gloves, although he would have been forgiven if he were. Conditions in Shrewsbury are exactly as you would expect in early March, the sun negated by a freezing wind that blows across a terrible pitch, which one onlooker describes as “one of the best in Shropshire”. Roberto Carlos belongs at the Bernabéu, or at the very least in glossy adverts and electro-drenched YouTube compilations, not at the Hanwood Village Hall Recreation Centre. How did Roberto Carlos come to be in Shrewsbury? Bull in the Barne United, named after a local pub, won a Dream Transfer raffle in January, and Roberto Carlos was enlisted by eBay, with the raffle proceeds going to the charity Football Beyond Borders. And so, Roberto Carlos pulls into the car park and shuffles into an expectant dressing room. “You’re late, Bobby – it’s your turn to do the kit next week,” Bull in the Barne’s manager and goalkeeper, Ed Speller, doesn’t say, although he really should. Speller, instead, is delighted with his new recruit. “It’s amazing,” he says. “When I found out that I won, I just started screaming: ‘No way!’ around the office. I just couldn’t believe it. I sent a message to the lads, and they went crazy. We need a left-back but I think he might be in centre mid today. I guess he could play anywhere. I’m just looking forward to getting back to the pub with him later.” Roberto Carlos is not the only unfamiliar sight to the usual few who follow Bull in the Barne United. Namely there is a TV camera crew, with Chris Kamara in tow. The Shrewsbury town crier has turned up in all his garb with his wife to whip the 150-strong crowd into a frenzy before the game. A local farmer, presumably up from Hereford, nearly causes a health and safety issue by standing on top of his digger to get a better view over the fence. There are wonderfully reassuring Sunday League vibes, too. The pitch is, inevitably, sloped, with one corner so muddy it is almost unplayable. The referee lets every bad challenge go, and the officials running the line arrive midway through the first half. Bull in the Barne spend most of their warm-up peppering Speller in goal. Roberto Carlos takes two free-kicks; the first is shanked 10 yards wide, the second curls gently over a makeshift wall and nestles in he corner of the net. It is a wonderful glimpse of the old magic. “I started playing on pitches like this in Brazil,” he says. “But I feel like I’ve learned a lot being here. It’s great to meet the boys as well. When I first started in Garça when I was 12, I played in a team with my dad and it was just like this. This is nothing new to me.” That said, the Greenhous Shrewsbury and District Sunday League Division One remains something of an unknown quantity and the chance, however small, of being nutmegged by a Harlescott Rangers winger is not exactly great for the brand. The 48-year-old starts on the bench, and things go badly for Bull. Two-nil down after 35 minutes, they bring on the Brazilian and he promptly loses the ball twice. “Play it simple, Roberto,” comes a heckle from the sideline. Half-time comes, and Roberto Carlos does not emerge from the dressing room. There is concern. The Brazilian’s leg is playing up, caused by a motorbike accident in Madrid recently. “Talk quietly about that, please,” he says with a smile. Harlescott race to a 4-1 lead, before Roberto Carlos re-emerges on the sideline. Bull are seemingly buoyed by his presence in the dugout, as substitutes jostle for selfies, and roar back to 4-2 before earning a late penalty. There is only one man for it. Roberto Carlos comes on, tucks the ball into the corner for 4-3 and subs himself off again immediately, all in the space of 40 seconds. Bull can’t force an equaliser but the crowd got what they came for: a Roberto Carlos set piece. “Tactically, my teammates were not the same that I’m used to but they worked hard,” he insists afterwards. “I’m delighted to come and make debut for an English team. I nearly joined Chelsea in 2007 and Aston Villa in 1995, but it didn’t work out.” You might say it worked out OK. Rather than a move to Birmingham, Roberto Carlos would sign for Roy Hodgson at Internazionale, then Real Madrid where he would win numerous La Liga and Champions League titles, adding to his World Cup winner’s medal in 2002. Playing for Bull in the Barne United, he says, means he has now “completed football”. “My teammate Ronaldo Nazário would have been helpful today,” he jokes. “He started at a club called São Cristóvão, similar to this. When you are a king, you never lose your majesty.”",Sport/Football,A Shropshire lad: Roberto Carlos becomes a pub footballer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/a-shropshire-lad-roberto-carlos-becomes-a-pub-footballer
3/5/2022,"Trucks carrying large cylindrical containers sweep down a snowy road to a soundtrack of hollering and an alarming, if amateurish, caption: “RUSIA NUCLEAR BOMB”. The video was taken down, but not before it received 18m views. Welcome to the Russia-Ukraine conflict on TikTok. TikTok has 1 billion users worldwide and is an important news source for adults and particularly those under 25. A quarter of US adults say they always use TikTok to get the news, with nearly half of US millennial and Gen Z adults – under-41s and under-25s respectively – indicating the same, according to analysis firm Forrester Research. Mike Proulx, a research director at Forrester, says TikTok’s algorithm, which curates what users see, has combined with the app’s popularity to make it a compelling outlet for people looking for information on the conflict. “The confluence of social media and mobile has enabled everyone to be instant, on-the-ground publishers. Add TikTok’s algorithm and popularity into the mix, and you get the perfect storm of content virality,” he says. According to Forrester, half of adults under 25 in the UK use TikTok at least once a week. Ukraine footage on TikTok varies wildly, from satirical commentary to false footage and accurate news clips. A London-based TikToker, Nikita Redkar, has received nearly 3m views for her tongue-in-cheek clip describing the conflict like a relationship breakdown: “Back in the 90s Russia and Ukraine used to be a thing but things got really messy and they broke up.” An even more popular follow-up post, captioned “Will there be a WW3?” continues with the theme, describing Nato as a “group of besties” who cannot support Ukraine because “you don’t roll with the crew”. Pdotz, a popular British TikToker with more than half a million followers, has received about 3m views for his explainers on the conflict. Other posts are from TikTok users presenting looped footage as live images from the conflict. An example of this included a video flagged by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) in which live footage purportedly from the point of view of a Ukrainian soldier was in fact on a loop. The account that posed the footage, and similar videos, received millions of views before disappearing. CCDH says it is problematic that TikTok videos do not show where a clip was posted, meaning that viewers are unable to discern whether footage ostensibly from the frontlines of the conflict is posted from Moscow, for instance. Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of CCDH, says TikTok has unique features that allow the rapid spread of false information. “The algorithm is currently aggressively promoting Ukraine-related content, irrespective of whether it’s true or not,” he said. “Unlike other platforms, it also provides users with little metadata with which users can do their own verification work – or even find out where this footage is coming from.” TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, says it took down the “RUSIA NUCLEAR BOMB” video for violating its community guidelines on integrity and authenticity. TikTok says it will also remove accounts that violate those guidelines although the account behind the nuclear video is still live. A TikTok spokesperson said: “We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation and other violations of our community guidelines. We also partner with independent factchecking organisations to support our efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.” TikToks about misinformation, and how to spot it, are also proving popular. Abbie Richards, a TikToker with 536,000 followers who regularly posts on misinformation, has received more than half a million views for her guide to spotting false videos – including overdubbed audio and recycling old footage. Old footage has proved popular. One video captioned “Ukrainian soldiers saying goodbye to their families” has had 2.8m views but is clearly footage of US soldiers and their loved ones. Video game footage has also been adapted, with one clip purportedly showing a Ukrainian jet downing a Russian fighter – which has had nearly 10m views and is still live – but can be traced to a YouTube video made on a flight simulator game. The ITV News TikTok account is posting regularly on Ukraine and is garnering up to 400,000 views for its posts, but pales in comparison with less expert accounts with the same, or fewer, followers. There is nothing unusual about TikTok’s algorithm compared with other platforms, according to Julian McAuley, a professor of computer science at the University of California, San Diego. “TikTok uses fairly ‘standard’ recommendation technology that will mostly recommend content that’s consistent with what users have previously engaged with. If users frequently consume misinformation (or slanted content), they’re likely to see more of it.” Russian influencers are also getting involved. Niki Proshin, a 27-year-old Russian TikToker with 765,00 followers, posted a video in which he said he was speaking for “regular Russians” and “normal people in Russia do not support this [war]”. Meanwhile, Marta Vasyuta, a Ukrainian-British TikToker with 187,000 followers, has been regularly posting footage of the conflict that has attracted millions of views from users on the platform. Asked why she was posting the footage, Vasyuta said: “I want more people to be aware about what is going on in my country.”",News/Technology,War as seen on TikTok: Ukraine clips get views whether true or not,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/05/tiktok-ukraine-russia-invasion-clips-get-views-whether-true-or-not
3/5/2022,"Ukraine’s national cinema is a storied and distinctive one, though not one that has traditionally received the exposure it deserves. That’s been shifting of late, with Ukrainian film-makers such as Sergei Loznitsa and Valentyn Vasyanovych finding a following on the international film festival circuit. On the streaming side of things, availability is pretty patchy even when it comes to some major titles – though a couple of useful online initiatives are seeking to put that right. We’ll begin with probably the most famous vision of Ukraine on screen: Dziga Vertov’s landmark 1929 documentary Man With a Movie Camera (BFI Player), which landed in the top 10 of Sight and Sound magazine’s all-time greatest films poll a decade ago. Nearly a century after it was made, it remains a playful, modern-feeling work, observing everyday working life in the Ukrainian city of Odessa – with additional passages in Kyiv, Kharkiv and a hop over to Moscow – over the course of several years. Full of formal trickery and innovation, it’s a film alive with the possibilities of the new. Less canonised Ukrainian titles from the 20th century are harder to legally source online. Amazon somewhat surprisingly turned up The Lost Letter (1970), produced by the region’s legendary Dovzhenko Film Studios. A Gogol-inspired cross-country musical, it’s both highly flavourful and an acquired taste. The free streaming service Plex has another Dovzhenko nugget from 1974, the second world war fighter-pilot romp Only Old Men Are Going to Battle, but otherwise pickings are slim. I thought I was on to something with the official YouTube channel of the Ukrainian state film agency, which appears to be richly stocked with local features, shorts and cartoons – though for any outsiders not fluent in Ukrainian or Russian, the absence of subtitles on any of the videos makes it suitable for curious, cursory browsing at best. More fruitful is Takflix, a streaming service dedicated to bringing Ukrainian cinema to a global audience, founded by local film lovers and aiming to support the national film industry by returning 50% of VOD proceeds to participating film-makers. (A pop-up on the site’s welcome page, however, informs us that 50% is currently going to humanitarian organisations.) It’s an accessible site, allowing users to filter films by length, genre and even director gender, and while their library is mostly contemporary, a few vintage titles are available. I was rather taken with Yuri Ilyenko’s 1971 wartime saga The White Bird Marked With Black, which mixes heated Soviet-versus-nationalist politics, romantic melodrama and folkloric detail to heady effect. Of the recent selections, Gamer packs a chilly punch: directed by Oleg Sentsov, the Ukrainian film-maker famously imprisoned in Russia on trumped-up terrorist charges, its study of a teenager pursuing a professional gaming career and facing an existential void works as a tacit cry for a nation’s stymied youth. The great new-generation Ukrainian film of the past decade, however, is undoubtedly Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi’s astonishing debut The Tribe (2014; BFI Player), a study of bullying and criminality at a high school for deaf people – performed entirely in unsubtitled sign language. If that sounds daunting, the performances and dramatic stakes are so vivid you’ll find yourself wholly immersed. More classically stately and solemnly moving is Nariman Aliev’s 2019 film Homeward (Curzon), in which a father and son embark on a burial mission from Kyiv to Crimea; a modern feminist perspective, meanwhile, emerges in the lively Julia Blue (2017; Amazon), in which director Roxy Toporowych tells a Kyiv romance through the prism of post-revolutionary PTSD. The defining Ukrainian film-maker of the present, however, is the aforementioned Loznitsa, whose fearsomely prolific filmography moves freely between experimental narrative and deep-dive documentary. His extraordinary doc Maidan (2014; Dogwoof on Demand) is a visceral, in-the-moment account of 2013-14 civil unrest in Kyiv’s Maidan Square – though it was beaten to an Oscar nomination by Evgeny Afineevsky’s more conventionally polished but still rousing film on the same subject, Winter on Fire (2015; Netflix). But Loznitsa’s pitch-black 2018 war comedy Donbass (BFI Player) – finding despair and absurdity in the mid-2010s conflict between Ukraine and the Donetsk People’s Republic – proves he can be just as acute in fiction. One presumes a ferocious take on the current crisis will come. West Side Story(Disney)Steven Spielberg’s remake of the beloved 1961 musical is buoyant and whirlingly well made, and benefits from an intelligent, socially conscious adaptation by Tony Kushner – but still can’t help feeling like a nostalgia exercise, in contrast to the original’s youthful modernity. It seems like a missed opportunity for a more radical update. Blue Bayou(Universal)Writer-director-star Justin Chon’s immigration-themed melodrama is full to bursting with good intentions, and grounded by his own stirring performance as a Korean-American facing deportation despite having lived almost all his life in the US. He’s a more nuanced actor than he is a film-maker, however: such a potent story doesn’t need such blunt treatment. Train Again(Mubi)Mubi doesn’t often give individual releases to short films, but Austrian avant garde director Peter Tscherkassky’s 20-minute head trip is special: a vertiginous assemblage of film clips honouring both the origins of cinema and the prominent role of locomotives in screen history, all layered, looped and woven together with kinetic, hypnotic imagination.",Arts/Film,Streaming: the best Ukrainian films past and present,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/05/streaming-best-films-ukraine-man-with-a-movie-camera-sergei-loznitsa
3/5/2022,"A drive by wealthy companies to plant forests in the Scottish Highlands to offset their carbon emissions risks creating even greater inequalities in rural areas, a major report has warned. The analysis says a surge of Highland estate sales to major corporations and cash-rich investors, such as Aviva, Standard Life and BrewDog, has driven up land prices sharply and increased the elitism and exclusivity of land ownership, while they aim to limit climate heating. John Hollingdale, a community ownership expert, argues that much stricter rules on land ownership, tax breaks and forestry subsidies are needed to ensure the rush to meet government forestry and net zero targets has the widest public benefit. The Scottish and UK governments have targets to plant 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) of new woods and forests across Britain a year. Scottish Forestry, a government agency, is midway through a three-year programme worth £217m to plant 46,500 hectares (115,000 acres) of new woodland by April 2025, roughly equivalent to 93m trees. In a report for Community Land Scotland, a land reform body, Hollingdale said those investments were further subsidised by exemptions from inheritance tax, business property tax relief, and income and corporation tax on profits for commercial woodland, as well as non-domestic rates exemptions. Calum MacLeod, policy director for Community Land Scotland, said: “The paper’s detailed analysis and recommendations shows that green finance mechanisms need to be fit for purpose in terms of a just transition by making land use sustainable in ways that significantly benefit local communities.” Standard Life Investments, Aviva and BrewDog are the best-known examples of companies that have spent tens of millions of pounds in the last year buying land for forestry, peatland restoration and woodland creation to offset their carbon emissions or sell climate-focused investments to their clients. Known as natural capital or green finance investments, corporations have come under intense pressure to absorb or offset their carbon emissions to hit the Paris climate accord goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C by 2050. To the alarm of land reform campaigners and the National Farmers’ Union, that has led to land prices more than doubling in some areas of Scotland, as the competition for upland estates and farmland intensifies. Purchases by big companies such as the beer company BrewDog remain relatively rare but they reinforce another more subtle trend, Hollingdale argues. Increased funding for forestry and its tax advantages means existing owners can increase the value of their land and businesses by moving into woodland creation. While that has environmental benefits, it can make owners less likely to sell, pushing up land values by increasing scarcity. Hollingdale’s report warns this trend also prices out local communities hoping to buy their land to increase local employment, tourism, ecological management and micro-businesses. In 2020, the Scottish Land Fund, which funds community buyouts, stopped taking applications after five months because its £10m budget was oversubscribed. That has since been doubled to £20m, but surging land prices may soon swallow up that increased funding. Hollingdale recommends green financing projects are regulated to ensure they support genuine carbon offsetting; that ministers remove tax exemptions which distort land prices, and increase sales taxes on agricultural buildings; and that land owners are required to produce management plans and introduce public interest tests for large estates. Hamish Trench, the chief executive of the Scottish Land Commission, an official body focused on reforming highly concentrated patterns of land ownership, believes there is a “real risk” green finance investments will further concentrate the ownership of land and its benefits. In 2019, the commission said, just 87 owners – made up of private owners, charities and state-run bodies – controlled 1.7m hectares of rural Scotland. Trench said it was essential the financing was used in the public interest. “How do we harness this new finance coming in so it actively supports the mixed and community ownership model? We see an opportunity to do that,” he said. Sarah Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, which represents many large landowners, said this trend was still in its infancy but had tremendous economic potential. There were still numerous opportunities for community groups and social enterprises to buy land, often with public or private support. “Significant funds could flow into Scotland – benefiting nature, people and jobs,” she said. “Green investment has the potential to provide landowners of all types with revenue streams and community owners and farmers may well benefit from these emerging opportunities. However, these are very early days for all landowners.”",News/UK news,Corporate tree-planting drive in Scotland ‘risks widening rural inequality’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/05/tree-planting-drive-scottish-highlands-risks-widening-inequality
3/5/2022,"It is a typically eye-catching boast by the great provocateur of British brewing. James Watt, co-founder of the beer company BrewDog, pledged to plant “the biggest ever” forest in Scotland to help regenerate ancient woodlands that once carpeted the Highlands. BrewDog’s Lost Forest would stretch over a “staggering” 50 sq km (19 sq miles), Watt said, and involve millions of trees. One promotional film said the forest would be “capable of sequestering up to 550,000 tonnes of CO2 each year”. Good soundbites, but not entirely accurate. Kinrara, a former Highland sporting estate, climbs from the River Spey just outside Aviemore high into the sub-Arctic reaches of the Monadhliath Mountains. It is perfectly suited for the millions of birch, oak, rowan, alder and Scots pine trees BrewDog plans to plant. To a tourist’s eye, Kinrara is picture perfect. Lone specimens of Scots pine punctuate the skyline alongside a hill track winding into the mountains known as the Burma Road. These veterans are in fact evidence of the loss centuries ago of huge woodlands and forests that once covered the flanks of these hills, a loss BrewDog has pledged to reverse. It also has plans for a distillery, eco-tourism and adventure sports on the site. BrewDog paid £8.8m for Kinrara, according to Land Registry records, although many media reports at the time said it cost more than £10m. Its total size is equivalent to 37 sq km – not the 50 sq km it originally claimed. About a third of that has been dedicated to new woodlands. There is also a peatland restoration project. Watt is the latest of Scotland’s green lairds, a pejorative label coined for the new generation of largely absentee Highland landowners who have bought rural estates with the climate and biodiversity in mind. Some, such as the Asos billionaire Anders Povlsen, invest their wealth in rewilding and conservation tourism, heavily culling deer, abandoning grouse-shooting and removing sheep to promote natural regeneration and recolonisation by previously persecuted birds of prey. Some major corporations, including the investment companies Aviva and Standard Life, have bought land purely to plant forests and restore peatland. That is being driven by pressure from activists and shareholders to cut or offset their emissions. Rural estate agents such as Strutt & Parker and Galbraith report a surge in buyers seeking land for woodlands projects, sometimes exclusively or as additional factors in their quest for a private Highland sporting retreat, increasing competition for the few estates that come onto the market. That has steeply driven up land prices, to the alarm of land reform campaigners who want the Scottish government to break up large Highland estates. Hill ground with natural capital potential can sell for £1,200 to £1,600 an acre, double its value several years ago. That demand is expected to intensify. Major corporations have set aside billions of pounds globally to invest in green capital projects. Some have approached government agencies with offers to buy Highland estates or invest in nature reserves, promising budgets of hundreds of millions of pounds. An analysis for Community Land Scotland, which represents Scotland’s growing number of community-ownership projects, has found most woodland finance schemes have come from existing landowners. By December 2021, 638 new Scottish forests and woods had been registered with the Woodland Carbon Code, an official scheme that allows their owners to sell carbon credits, where the CO2 captured by new trees is sold to companies to offset their carbon emissions. Most are still at the planning stage. Many will be subsidised by Scottish Forestry, the agency that runs the Woodland Carbon Code, which is spending an average of £70m a year over three years to hit a government target to plant 46,500 hectares (115,000 acres) of new woodland and forest by April 2025. Many schemes are small but can also push up the value of rural land, further concentrating wealth in the hands of those able to afford them, say critics. BrewDog has applied for forest grant scheme subsidies for the first phase of Lost Forest and could gain up to £1.25m, spread over several years. That will not cover all BrewDog’s costs, which could be significant and include consultancy fees and the culling of about 145 deer to prevent its saplings being grazed to death. Early promotions for the Lost Forest suggested each can or pack of Lost Lager sold would fund a tree at Kinrara. A recent advert on BrewDog’s online store on Amazon stated “for every pack we plant a tree in the BrewDog Lost Forest”. A BrewDog tweet offering free packs of Lost Lager in January 2021, which has been taken down, included a film about the Lost Forest under the wording “we’ll plant a tree in our forest” for every pack given away. The company denies it intended to claim a tree would be planted at Kinrara for every sale of Lost Lager; it told the Guardian that promotion was linked to an Eden Project forest it supports in Madagascar. It changed its Amazon advert last week after it was flagged by the Guardian and promised to amend the film claiming Kinrara was 50 sq km in size. It said similar claims linking lager sales to tree-planting in the Lost Forest carried in licensed trade newspapers last year were “an error in communication”. BrewDog also accepted the claim Kinrara could capture up to 550,000 tonnes of CO2 a year was wrong. The correct figure was up to 1m tonnes over 100 years, it said. BrewDog said the vast bulk of the Lost Forest’s overall costs would be met by the company. It had devoted tens of millions of pounds to making its business “carbon negative”, a spokesperson said. “The Lost Forest will, in time, contribute to our pledge to remove twice as much carbon from the air as we emit.” Questions about the Lost Lager promotion were a distraction, he said, since every bottle of beer it sold contributed to its climate strategy. “None of this should distract from the fact that our No 1 priority is to reduce emissions,” he said. “The more beer we sell the more we invest in these schemes.”",News/Environment,Lost Forest: why is BrewDog’s green scheme causing controversy?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/05/lost-forest-why-is-brewdog-green-scheme-causing-controversy
3/5/2022,"I recently booked myself in for a lash lift and, as I emerged with curlier, fluttery eye-valances, I wondered why I don’t do this more often. Lash lifting offers a more lasting curl than mascara for those of us with determinedly straight strands, but costs much less than individual lash extensions, which are wonderful for a special occasion, but not sustainable for anyone but the super-rich in terms of both time and money – a full set of extensions can take hours. A lift can be customised to your eye shape (I can’t live with too steep an incline because the bend makes eyeliner application maddeningly fiddly). It wears off slowly and with no ill effect on the natural lashes, whereas badly applied or heavy extensions cause the real hairs beneath to become sparse over time. My own lash technician, Teresa Smith of I Love Lash (London-based, but lash perms are available all over, starting at about £25 depending on location), offers two different brands – LVL and Elleebana – both of which retain their curl for a good six to eight weeks. Mascara can be worn on top as usual, but the effects are so good that I find myself less inclined to bother. If it’s length rather than curl you lack, you may have considered lash growth serums. Once monopolised by Revitalash, the market now offers myriad options, and the number of questions I’m asked about these products has soared. I mostly recommend Lash Force Eyelash Growth Serumby British salon brand NYK1 (£44.95). It’s expensive, as they all are, but the tube is at least double the size of most, gives a couple of months’ use and, most importantly, it actually works. Whichever lash serum you choose, what will define its success is diligent use, which is why I rarely use one myself (vitamin supplements are struggle enough). Most serums must be applied each morning and evening for at least four to five weeks: you paint it on to the lash line much as you might apply liquid liner, only a little more firmly, pressing the brush into the roots. If that sounds like a faff – well, it sort of is – you might find it helpful to store the serum next to your toothbrush so you don’t forget. And if you’ve just been through chemotherapy (and you must wait until it’s completed before starting with the serum), then such fripperies will feel like a picnic.",Lifestyle/Fashion,I've just had a lash lift – will these eyelash tricks kill off mascara for good? | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/05/ive-just-had-a-lash-lift-will-these-eyelash-tricks-kill-off-mascara-for-good
3/5/2022,"Inever saw the likes of Richie Benaud and the famous leg-spinners of yesteryear, but even so I can say with complete confidence that Shane Warne is right up there among the greats of the game throughout history. Not only because of his own brilliance as a player, his warmth and generosity, and his later contribution as a coach and as a commentator, but because of his impact on cricket. Shane Warne made leg-spin sexy and from the moment he broke on to the scene the art of spin was revitalised all over the world. One of the things I most admired about him was the way he approached the game. He would always push to take the attack to the opposition, to take the positive option. His mentality was that of a winner, fuelled by the self-belief that came with having such great skill. He could deliver a leg-break pretty much unlike anything we had seen, and with great accuracy. His best delivery would drift in towards leg stump before spinning away from the right-hander – it was his stock ball, and a bloody great one. If I compare him with some of the other great spinners I faced such as Anil Kumble, Saqlain Mushtaq or Mushtaq Ahmed, one of the unusual things about him was that he rarely bowled a googly; his stock ball was such a great delivery he didn’t really need to. I remember there was often a bit of kidology before the Ashes series that he had developed a new delivery, but that ball was good enough to beat many Test cricketers. He was not just a great player, but a great character. He burst on to the scene in 1993, in an Australia team captained by Allan Border and including the likes of Merv Hughes. As a group they were very in-your-face, very aggressive, used lots of blunt language, and Warne fitted right in. He was so competitive on the pitch but he would also speak to absolutely anybody off the field, completely welcoming of opposition players if they wanted a chat after a game. I remember one occasion when I was playing for Surrey against Hampshire, and after the game Azhar Mahmood had gone into the Hampshire dressing room to speak to Warne before emerging with a brand new Gray-Nicolls bat. I asked him where he had got it from, and he said: “Warney just gave it to me.” At that point I had never really spoken to Warne except on the field, but such was the quality of the bat I soon found myself striding across the Hampshire dressing room where Warne was sitting, fag in one hand, beer in the other. I asked if he still had some extra bats, and he told me to look in his locker. He had about 10 bats in there and I ended up taking one away. The generosity of the man was striking. He was equally generous with his knowledge and his time, and inspired great loyalty in those around him. When he captained Hampshire his positivity, his creativity and the way he put faith in the players around him and brought the best out of them was obvious, and he was much loved there. I am absolutely sure he would have been a formidable Australia captain, an honour he never received, probably because he was a little bit rough around the edges as often genius players can be. He did not necessarily conform, and was not always a believer in sports science and data. He famously said that the only coach a team needs is the one that takes them to the ground, before going on himself to prove the positive effect a good coach can have. I was told a story about his time at Rajasthan Royals that makes this point well. He was preparing his side to face their next opponents and turned to one of the young, inexperienced Indian players, someone who was not even in the side at the time, and in front of the whole squad asked his opinion about one of the opposition players the young man happened to know. Just by asking this young player’s opinion, by listening to it and taking it seriously, he made him feel valued, boosted his confidence and brought him into the senior group, but in a subtle and unshowy way. As a player he always had great presence. He was a character, an extrovert, never shy of saying a word or two. Later I spent some time with him while doing media work and found him great fun to be around. He loved being in company, meeting new people. He had some really interesting ideas on cricket and whether you agreed with him or not, he was always thought-provoking in a positive way, talking about the game in the same spirit he had played it. He was an unforgettable player, a warm and open character, a superstar package. He will be fondly remembered and greatly missed.",Sport/Sport,Shane Warne was fuelled by self-belief – and he made leg-spin sexy | Mark Ramprakash,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/shane-warne-was-fuelled-by-self-belief-and-he-made-leg-spin-sexy
3/5/2022,"The last time Angela Davis was in Birmingham, Alabama, she caught up with childhood friends and her Sunday school teacher. While many of us would reminisce about favourite classes and first kisses, they discussed bombs. “We talked about what it was like to grow up in a city where there were bombings all the time,” she says. Most notoriously, in September 1963, the Ku Klux Klan bombed the 16th Street Baptist church, killing four girls. It wasn’t a one-off, says the legendary radical feminist, communist and former Black Panther. “People’s homes were bombed, synagogues were bombed, other churches were bombed. People think of that as a single event, but it was more indicative of the pervasive terror at that time in Birmingham.” When the girls were killed, Davis was 19, a brilliant young scholar travelling through Europe. She read about the attack in newspapers. “It was one of the most devastating experiences of my life. My sister was very close with one of the girls, Carole Robertson. I just recently spent time with Carole’s sister, Diane, who was one of my close friends growing up.” When Davis managed to phone her family from France, her mother told her she had driven Carole’s mother to the church after the bombing. “And, of course, she received the terrible, terrible news ...” She trails off. “The back yard of one of the other girls almost abutted ours. We were neighbours and friends. And my mother taught yet another of the girls. So we had connections with three of the four girls who were killed on that day.” By 1965, the FBI had the names of the bombers, but there were no prosecutions until 1977. Is this what turned her into a revolutionary? “I experienced it as a deeply personal assault, and it was a little while before I could stand back and think about the larger impact of it; the way it represented an effort to wipe out the resistance of youth. I think it was probably one of the moments that helped me find that path.” Does she think Birmingham shaped her politics? “Absolutely. I do. I do,” she says in her low-pitched, mellifluous voice. So if she had grown up in New York she would have become a different Angela Davis? She grins. “Well, I went to high school in New York and it was at high school that I first read The Communist Manifesto!” So we would have had the same Angela Davis either way? “Exactly. Exactly.” Back in the 1970s, Angela Yvonne Davis had one thing on her mind: revolution. She was public enemy number one to some, a beacon of hope to others. When she went on the run from the law charged with the murder of a judge and five counts of kidnapping, newspapers splashed her face across their front pages, naming her one of the FBI’s 10 most-wanted criminals. A few months later, her face was on the T-shirts of young radicals across the world, fighting for her release. Davis’s became the public face of resistance, pinned to myriad badges, placards and posters. Her great natural afro became the hairstyle of revolution. In the past she has said it is “humbling and humiliating ... to be remembered as a hairdo”. Anybody who was anybody in the world of culture supported her. When Nina Simone visited Davis in prison, she was overwhelmed by all the books in her cell and decided she needed to learn more about social justice. Aretha Franklin offered to pay her bail. James Baldwin wrote her a letter saying, “We must fight for your life as though it were our own – which it is – and render impassable with our bodies the corridor to the gas chamber. For, if they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night.” This provided the title for If They Come in the Morning …, an anthology of prison writings edited by Davis and published in 1971 when she was in jail. At 78 and today talking to me on a video call from sunny Oakland, California, Davis has become an elder stateswoman of the civil rights fight, but her radical spirit shines as bright as ever. Her hair is now a grey corkscrew bob – in its own ways every bit as distinguished as the iconic afro of yesteryear. She has just reissued her classic memoir, with a new foreword. Angela Y Davis: An Autobiography was first published in 1974, edited by the great Toni Morrison, two years after Davis was acquitted of murder, kidnap and criminal conspiracy. When Morrison first talked to her about writing a book, she wasn’t interested – she thought that at 26 she was too young to say anything significant, and didn’t want to write something that “focused on personal trajectory”. In the new foreword, she says Morrison convinced her to do it by insisting “on the importance of a political biography” in which she not only told the story of her life but also the history of the movement she had become involved with. She says revisiting her younger self for the new edition has both shocked and comforted her. “When I reread the autobiography, I was disturbed by my language and by what I did not know then, but I was also impressed by the continuity – the fact that we are still addressing issues that we were trying to address at that time. The dissonance I experienced, particularly in terms of the language, helped me to measure our progress, and how far we’d come.” Davis speaks in beautifully measured sentences, but sometimes you have to dig for the details. I ask if she is talking about her attitude to gay culture in prison, which seems surprisingly judgmental – not least because she has been in a relationship with a woman for the past 20 years. “Exactly!” she says, laughing. “I cringed.” In the memoir, she describes how women would replicate traditional family structures, “marrying” other women and referring to them as husbands. Davis didn’t get it. Why ape the patriarchy? In jail she couldn’t bring herself to refer to a woman as a husband or father. Now she says she was narrow-minded. “At the time, we weren’t even using the word gay. We used homosexual. And reading that made me cringe, too, because now we have developed a really capacious vocabulary to talk about both intimate and political experiences.” She’s being tough on herself. The remarkable thing about her autobiography is how relevant it still feels. In the 1960s and 70s, Davis says, everything was rigidly defined – not simply in terms of sexuality, but also revolutionary activity. “I didn’t regard those [prison marriage] practices as resistance practices. I had an intransigent notion as to what counts as resistance.” Everything was about belonging to a party and toeing that party line. “Now I see we are where we are today precisely because of large acts of resistance and small acts of resistance … I believe we need organised resistance and the forms of resistance that become practices in our daily lives.” While many people become more insular as they get older, she has become ever more outward-looking. Perhaps it’s this that distinguishes the older Davis from the twentysomething Black Panther who found herself in prison facing a possible death sentence 50 years ago. Today, she has an extraordinary capacity to absorb and juggle ideas, many seemingly at odds with each other. Davis is talking to me from a room lined with books in the home she shares with her civil partner, Gina Dent, a fellow professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The two women have a lot in common. They have just written Abolition. Feminism. Now. together with two other authors (Erica R Meiners and Beth E Richie). At the heart of the book is the demand to defund the police, demilitarise the army and halt prison construction. The authors argue that all three perpetuate violence, inequality and structural racism. Davis’s politics are expressed not merely in what she writes, but how she writes. Although there are four authors, the book is written in one voice. Its form reflects her belief in collective action. When she wrote her memoir, the concept of intersectionality was not widely known, though many women of colour had been struggling with the ways they were discriminated against because of both their sex and their race, and how they impacted on each other. Although Davis was already a famous radical feminist, she says she often felt isolated, and questioned her place within the movement. “There was a backwardness in the early days of certain elements of feminism that refused to recognise the degree to which gender is historically and socially constructed. This is why I refused to consider myself a feminist for a while – the insistence that all of your loyalty has to be to women, and that tended to mean white women. I can remember being asked, ‘Are you Black or are you a woman?’” What? She laughs. “Yes. I was asked that. Even when we had no precedents for intersectional notions I made it very clear, and I’m not the only one, that for many Black women the issues were intertwined. We could not separate one from the other.” Who asked this? “Oh, some of those white feminists I did not like.” She smiles. No names. What did you say? “I said it’s a ridiculous question. This is the power of racism, that they could not recognise, for example, that in struggling against gender violence directed against women, one also had to take up the racist use of the rape charge, and they were part and parcel of the same battle. Of course, the intransigent white bourgeois feminists could not accept that.” Davis is no stranger to splits on the radical left or factional feminism. She has seen it all her life, and regretted it all her life. She doesn’t understand why some feminists today see trans women as a threat. “There are some feminist formations that are very opposed to the trans presence, and that is so backwards. Those of us who are more flexible argue that if you want to get rid of violence directed against individuals in the world, whether it’s racist violence or gender violence, you have to support Black trans women who are the target of more violence than any other group of people. And if we make advances in our struggle to defend Black trans women, those victories can be felt by all communities that suffer violence.” She says this fight reminds her of the days when she was asked to choose between being a woman and being Black. In her autobiography, she describes how many of the Black male revolutionaries regarded their activism as an assertion of their masculinity and believed women had no leadership role to play. Even so, she says, back then she didn’t fully appreciate how she had been shaped as much by gender as by race. In the intervening half-century, she has realised how the two are umbilically linked in the fight for a better world. Davis inherited her revolutionary spirit from her mother, Sallye, a schoolteacher and activist who was involved in the Southern Negro Youth Congress, organised by Black communists. Sallye was part of the successful campaign to release the Scottsboro Boys (nine Black teenagers falsely accused of raping two white women) – a case seen as a milestone in the emergence of a national civil rights movement. Davis’s father, Frank, was also a teacher and an Episcopalian lay minister. “He was not as outspoken as my mother, but he made his contributions in a quieter way.” Both her parents grew up “dirt poor” and only managed to become teachers because they were financially supported – her mother by the principal of her high school, her father by the Episcopalian church. Her father gave up teaching and bought a service station and parking lot to enable him to better support Angela and her three siblings. Davis grew up with a burning sense of justice – and injustice. She received a good education at her segregated school, where she was taught about Black history, and endowed with pride. “The teachers felt the need to cultivate a generation who would be capable of resisting the ideological racism surrounding us.” Her mother told young Angela that the world they were living in was not the world of the future. “She always said: never forget that that world is not organised in the way it should be and that things will change, and that we will be a part of that change.” In her late teens, Davis worked part-time to earn enough money to travel to France and Switzerland, and to attend the eighth World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki. When she returned home in 1963, the FBI interviewed her about her attendance at the Soviet-sponsored festival. After a year studying literature in France, she enrolled on Herbert Marcuse’s philosophy course at the University of Frankfurt. Davis later said: “Marcuse taught me that it was possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar and a revolutionary.” In 1969, aged 25, she was hired as an assistant professor of philosophy at UCLA. A campaign spearheaded by California governor Ronald Reagan resulted in her sacking for being a member of the Communist party USA. By then she was also known as a radical feminist and affiliate of the LA chapter of the Black Panther party. When a court ruled she could not be fired solely because of her affiliation with the Communist party, she resumed her post, only to be fired again in June 1970 for “inflammatory language” used in four speeches, including repeatedly referring to the police as “pigs”. By this time her mentor was the Black Panther George Jackson, who had been convicted of armed robbery in 1961. In January 1970, Jackson and two others were charged with murdering a prison officer in Soledad prison, California. The three men became known as the Soledad Brothers and Davis campaigned for their release. Davis came to love Jackson and befriended his younger brother, 17-year-old Jonathan, who accompanied her on public appearances as an informal bodyguard. On 7 August 1970, Jonathan Jackson used guns registered in Davis’s name (she was regularly receiving death threats from white supremacists at this point) to hold up a courtroom at Marin county courthouse. He took superior court judge Harold Haley and four others hostage to secure the freedom of the Soledad Brothers. As he attempted to drive away, police opened fire, and Jonathan Jackson, Judge Haley and two prisoners were killed. The siege was headline news. As was the fact that the guns Jackson used were owned by Davis. On 14 August, Davis was charged with “aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder in the death of Judge Harold Haley”, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. By then, Davis had gone on the run. Four days later, FBI director J Edgar Hoover put Davis on the FBI’s 10 most-wanted fugitives list; she was only the third woman to be listed. On 13 October 1970, FBI agents found her in New York. Davis has always said she had no prior knowledge of Jackson’s plans, and was shocked by the incident and the death of her young friend. How does she look back at her time in prison? It’s complex, she says. In one way, it was terrifying; in another, she got a better education than any university could provide. She saw for herself how much easier it was to end up in prison if you were working class and a person of colour, and how much harder it was to get out. Many women she met were locked up for petty crimes but couldn’t afford the $500 bail, so were stuck in the system. She discovered that, although slavery had been abolished in 1865, it was thriving in US jails thanks to the 13th amendment making a special allowance for penal labour. Davis realised she had to synthesise race, class and gender in her analysis. “It was a time of learning. Deep learning. That period defined the trajectory of the rest of my life.” Was there a time when she thought she would be executed? “Yes, there was. There was. There was.” She repeats it gently, like a mantra. “I felt terrified that I might end up in the gas chamber in San Quentin prison. Ronald Reagan wanted to see that, Richard Nixon wanted to see that, J Edgar Hoover. So many people were convinced that despite my innocence of the actual charges I would be like Sacco and Vanzetti, the Rosenbergs, or any of the other political figures who have been put to death. And, yeah, it was terrifying. I had nightmares.” But on the outside, the fight for her release grew bigger and bigger. It is this, she says, that gave her hope. “You know, I received over a million letters from schoolchildren in East Germany alone.” One million, I repeat, trying to picture that many letters. “Yes! A million postcards. Schoolchildren were supposed to send me a rose for my birthday, so they drew roses on postcards. It was called 1 Million Roses for Angela Davis. At first they started to come in big mailbags. They are at Stanford University now, in the archives.” There were campaigns worldwide. “Eventually the terror was displaced. I realised that even if I ended up being put to death I would not be alone; that they would all be walking with me. And that is what gave me courage. I learned about the value of mass movements and collective struggle; that lesson has remained with me.” It seems to me she has always been an optimist. “Well, you know, we need hope. We can’t do anything without optimism. My friend Mariame Kaba, who is part of the prison abolitionist movement, says hope is a discipline. Our job is to cultivate hope, and that is what I always try to do.” The campaign made her feel less isolated but she found the attention embarrassing; shaming, even. There were so many women in jail with nobody for support, and here she was with her million postcards. She was thankful, but she had never wanted to be a pin-up. “I feel best when I’m working in the background – teaching and organising is the work I love doing. I was very disturbed in jail because I saw so many women who got such a bad deal. It was not right for me to be the focus of so much attention when I already had a network of people.” Davis was released from prison after 16 months and acquitted four months later, in June 1972. Again, she was lucky. While she was jailed, the death sentence was abolished in California, allowing her to be bailed. At her trial, the prosecution argued that she was not a political prisoner; that she had provided the gun simply because of her love for George Jackson. It was an easy argument to refute. There was so much evidence of a life of political struggle and that she had campaigned vigorously for all three Soledad Brothers. By the time she was released, George Jackson was dead, killed while trying to escape prison. Does she think they would have married if he had lived? “That may have been a possibility, but I can’t say for sure because I do know that feelings are intensified under the pressure of incarceration, and people change.” As far as men go, was he the love of her life? For once, her speech becomes broken. “Erm, well, that may ... you may express it that way. Erm, yeah.” She quickly gathers herself. “At the same time, I want to emphasise how deep that political relationship was. I spent the majority of my time with George communicating with him about radical issues, and also with other partners that I’ve had, male and female.” With Dent, who is in her late 50s, she says it’s been the same. “We got to know each other because I was making a contribution to a book she was editing, so we were working together intellectually long before we came together.” She takes a sip from her mug. I ask what she is drinking. “Green tea and ginger.” That’s another big change. She lives a healthier life now. Is it true you used to smoke four packets of cigarettes a day? “Yeah, I was a terrible smoker. I smoked Gauloises. Now I try to exercise and eat vegan.” As she talks, I’m looking at her perfectly painted black nails. “I painted them myself!” she says proudly. She looks youthful and stylish – dressed all in black, except for satin-blue streaks in her scarf. It was only when she came out of prison she discovered what her family had done for her and what it had taken out of them. “My mother would tell me about people who she thought were her friends who severed connection with her because they did not want to be associated with somebody who had a communist daughter.” I bet there were times she wished you weren’t a communist and hadn’t got yourself in so much trouble, I say. “Oh yeah! I’m sure. I’m sure!” She laughs. “I thought about that myself sometimes. But both my mother and father were really proud of the work that I did and the support that came from my siblings. My sister Fania travelled all over the world when I was in jail. My brother Ben, who was a football player in the NFL, suffered as a result – they put him on the bench. Nevertheless, his wife organised the largest political rally in Cleveland around the demand for my freedom.” Why did they bench him? “Because he called out the journalists and asked them: why are you not asking me about my sister, who is in jail? We see the NFL at the centre of many waves of resistance now, but there was a nascent politicisation at that time and my brother was a part of it.” She talks about an image she loves that symbolises the way her family fought for her. “There is footage of my mother speaking at a rally where she’s holding my sister’s baby girl in one arm, with the other arm outstretched in a fist and calling for my freedom. I said: ‘Wow! I am my mother’s daughter.’” After her release, Davis continued where she had left off – with her career and her activism. She became a professor of ethnic studies, and is now professor emerita of history of consciousness and feminist studies at UC Santa Cruz. She ran twice as vice-president for the Communist party USA, and dedicated much of her life to fighting for fellow activists who remained in jail and for the abolition of the prison system. Her ideas on abolitionism have evolved over decades, and are now championed by sections of the Black Lives Matter movement and feature prominently in Ava DuVernay’s documentary on the subject, 13th. It’s funny, she says – so many people tell her it must be depressing fighting for the same things she was fighting for 60 years ago. But she’s not having any of it. So much has changed; she cites the fact that America elected Barack Obama twice. How does she think he did? “He could have done a lot more, and I’m angry that Guantánamo is still there, because he was going to shut Guantánamo, right? But at the same time, it was a world historical moment, and I treasure that moment and that it was enabled by young people who refused to believe it was impossible to elect a Black person.” She says you can’t simply blame Obama for any disappointments. “Again, we can’t project all of our power as a collective of human beings on to a single individual. So my critique is also a self-critique; there should have been mass demonstrations forcing him to move in a more radical direction. At the same time, I don’t think Black Lives Matter would have emerged except within the context that was created by the election of Obama.” The fact that there is now a mass mainstream anti-racist movement, involving white people as well as people of colour, is true progress, she says. As for President Biden, Davis believes his conservatism is a historical inevitability post-Trump. “When there are moments of upheaval, the recovery period always tends to emphasise the conservative.” But she says she has never focused on the dominant parties. “I think it’s important to think more capaciously about the meaning of politics. The millions of people who poured on to the streets in the aftermath of George Floyd’s lynching constituted a force that was so much more powerful than any political party. And if there is a new moment of trying to recognise structural racism that occurred as a result of those demonstrations, then I would say those people are the motors of history. It’s not about who the president was or is.” She had witnessed deaths in police custody throughout her life. The difference now was that mass protest (and digital technology) ensured officers could no longer go unpunished. Last June, Floyd’s killer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 years and six months for second-degree murder. Good comes out of bad, Davis says. The pandemic highlighted structural racism in both the US and the UK. In May 2020, research from the non-partisan APM Research Lab revealed Black Americans were three times more likely than white Americans to die of Covid. In the same month, the Office for National Statistics revealed that Black people were four times more likely to die of Covid than white people in England and Wales. Not only is the research being done to prove the existence of structural racism, Davis says, but people now are shouting about it. “There are young activists and scholars who are so much better at explaining what we tried so hard to figure out. Now they just take it for granted, and I love that.” You seem so content, I say. “Well, at this particular moment I really am happy to be alive and healthy and to be able to link what is happening at this moment to past histories.” Again, she says how lucky she is. “I treasure this time, because it means I get to see that the work that was done 50 and 60 years ago really mattered, even though there were moments when all of us felt it was in vain.” So many of the people in her life didn’t live to see the progress that has been made – her parents; George and Jonathan Jackson; the four girls murdered at the Birmingham church. “I feel that I’m a witness for those who did not make it this far.”  An Autobiography by Angela Y Davis is published by Penguin (£20).

3/5/2022,"Tensions are boiling over across flood-affected parts of New South Wales and Queensland, with frustration at the speed at which official support is being rolled out, as the death toll from the catastrophe mounts. On Saturday afternoon, a woman was found dead in flood waters in south-east Queensland, bringing the state’s toll to 11. Queensland police divers found the body in Mudgeeraba, on the outskirts of the Gold Coast, with investigators yet to confirm whether it was a 42-year-old woman who was last seen on 27 February. Meanwhile, in NSW, the death toll sat at six, with the Resilience NSW commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, reiterating that the state had “got to brace ourselves” for further deaths, with many towns and houses still cut off by flood water. He made the comments at a press conference with the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and various government ministers on the outskirts of Lismore on Saturday, as officials continued to visit flood-affected parts of the northern rivers region. Perrottet vowed he was “not going to spare a dollar” in flood recovery efforts, and promised to “not just rebuild” Lismore despite its flood prone environment. “Lismore is a great town and we’re going to make it greater.” Perrottet acknowledged that the official government agencies would likely make some mistakes throughout the mammoth cleanup task of rebuilding Lismore. He also said immediate housing for residents who had lost homes was a primary concern. The emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, said that of the roughly 1,400 rapid property damage assessments carried out in Lismore, 900 homes had already been deemed uninhabitable. Cooke also defended State Emergency Service workers following what she claimed was “unwarranted” criticism, as some communities – such as Mullumbimby and surrounding hinterland – had resorted to volunteer-led rescues. Cooke said that 5,000 defence force personnel would be deployed across NSW to assist with flood recovery, with the first 900 of them starting on Sunday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Regarding frustration from communities which had not been reached by official emergency services, Perrottet said “I don’t believe they’ve been forgotten”. Communities in the Tweed Valley and around Murwillumbah have been crowdfunding to hire helicopters to deliver medical supplies to cut-off properties, while untrained volunteers were performing emergency rescues and discovering corpses. While Perrottet had vowed to fund the flood recovery, there was frustration in Lismore on Saturday from locals trying to access government support. Luisa Duffy and Pierina Paron-Berry were still cleaning out the Me and My House childcare centre they’ve owned for 16 years. While it took until Thursday for flood waters to recede enough for them to access the Diadem Street centre, the enormity of the cleanup meant that they were still ripping out floor boards on Saturday with a team of local volunteers. Duffy was scathing of the bureaucracy required to access many of the immediate support payments on a federal and state level – noting that internet and phone reception had been close to non-existent across the northern rivers this week. “The premier can hold a nice and dry press conference, but how about us still cleaning up here? How do our staff even lodge their payment applications without internet? “They’re asking for details about banking history and how much paid leave they have available – and this is for people who’ve lost all their files and computers, for a payment that is less than jobkeeper was. “Do they [government] realise how tough it is to just access the internet right now? They’ve got no idea ... We just need more from both the state and federal governments right now,” Duffy said. Paron-Berry said childcare would be in short supply in Lismore, as seven centres had been taken out by the floods. She said she could not even estimate how long it would take for them to reopen. She said many of her centre’s kids were the children of workers at the Lismore hospital – which is nearby – and that it was important for children to have some sense of familiarity at a time when their home situation and all of their other surroundings were changing. “These kids have no consistency in their lives, it’s so important for their emotional and psychological safety.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Paron-Berry said the centre was uninsured, having tried unsuccessfully to offer their insurance company to pay a premium to get reinsured after the 2017 floods. “People just don’t get it, that after 2017 insurance companies give you a flat no if you live in Lismore,” Paron-Berry said. The cost of the flood disaster in NSW was now more than $240m, according to the Insurance Council of Australia, while estimates taking in Queensland claims reached more than $1bn on Friday. The ICA said it had received 67,537 flood-related claims, 24% from NSW and 76% from south-east Queensland. However, many of the most seriously flood-affected residents in NSW towns were still struggling to access internet and phone reception to be able to lodge insurance claims.

3/5/2022,"In dark jacket, grey sweater and white undershirt, Travis Kalanick was relaxed in comfy chair, coffee mug before him, shooting the breeze with late-night TV host Stephen Colbert. Then came a cry from the studio audience. “Shame! Respect drivers’ labour! Respect professional full-time work!” The camera picked out a T-shirt-wearing protester who, standing and cupping his hands to his mouth, yelled: “Uber exploits taxi drivers for profit and kills professional full-time work in the taxi industry!” Colbert asked the man to sit down and joked to Uber co-founder Kalanick: “That’s my cousin. I apologise.” This September 2015 incident – a rare moment when a king of the gig economy was confronted by one his powerless subjects – was not broadcast at the time, but finally aired on CBS last month, when Colbert interviewed actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt about playing Kalanick on the small screen. Super Pumped: the Battle for Uber is the story of how Kalanick led the fastest-growing startup in history, taking on incumbent taxi industries in San Francisco, America and the world. It is a compelling portrayal of a man who is in turns charming and obnoxious, genius and crazy, superhero and supervillain, and who gives new meaning to the word “disrupter”. It is also a glimpse of a tech industry where there is a thin line between creation and destruction and bad boys such as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla’s Elon Musk and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey are criticised for moving fast and breaking things with little regard for who gets hurt. Beth Schacter, an executive producer of Super Pumped, told a recent Washington Post Live event: “They’re kind of modern kings, and in that Shakespearean way of wanting to examine what makes a king and what brings a king down, it’s kind of where many of the kings are, either in the high finance area or in Silicon Valley.” Kalanick’s rise and fall was certainly Shakespearean. Born in Los Angeles in 1976, he learned to computer code at school and dropped out of university to start his first tech company when he was 22. He co-founded Uber in 2009, launching its first smartphone app, UberCab, the following year – a revolutionary idea for passengers to hail and pay for taxis on their phones and for drivers to work when they wanted. The first episode of Super Pumped finds Kalanick acknowledging that the original concept came from friend Garrett Camp, making his pitch to venture capitalist Bill Gurley (Kyle Chandler) and defying San Francisco city bureaucrats who want to crush him. With Gurley’s financial backing and mentorship. Kalanick embarked on a rule-breaking, self-mythologising global conquest that saw bitter battles with entrenched interests that helped drag transport into the 21st century (“We are in the world changing business,” says the screen version of Kalanick. “At least, I am.”) By 2017 the company had grown to an international operation with a market value of nearly $70bn. But in February that year a blogpost by former employee Susan Fowler blew the whistle on sexism and “bro culture” at the company, and in May, Kalanick was devastated by the death of his mother, Bonnie, 71, in a boating accident. By June, Kalanick’s wild ride at Uber came to an end when he was forced to resign over a series of lawsuits against the company over workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. It was at last a reckoning over years of poor treatment of workers and the dangerous conceit that high performers went unpunished. In short, Super Pumped has a lot of material to work with. It does so with slickly produced, tightly scripted, crisply acted relish (Uma Thurman plays Arianna Huffington, the co-founder of the Huffington Post, who was an Uber board member). The series is made for Showtime by the team behind Billions. Its primary source material is a bestselling non-fiction book of the same name by Mike Isaac, a New York Times technology correspondent who served a consultant, factchecker and co-executive producer. He has met Kalanick on numerous occasions, though the entrepreneur did not want to participate in the book. Isaac says by phone from Oakland, California: “He’s a very charismatic person. You might not immediately vibe with the guy because he’s a little more masculine than, let’s say, other folks that you want to hang out, with but he’s very sharp, very intense, very driven, willing to argue his points, but he can also charm you. “The last time I talked to him was right before he went to testify in court in the Google/Waymo trial, and he was still very magnetic. People flock to him in a certain way and he has the charisma, which is an important quality to have if you’re going to be leading the company.” Asked if he likes Kalanick personally, Isaac admits to having mixed feelings. “On the one hand, I try to see the whole person, and there’s more depth to him than you would have carried away if you were just reading the headlines a few years ago. “That said, you can’t divorce the person from the sort of things they cause in their life. Under him, Uber became a really dysfunctional place for a lot of people to work. Some people might say he created this new labour model that I know a lot of folks are upset exists. “So I don’t think he’s a cartoonish villain; I don’t think he’s a complete angel. He, like all of us, exists somewhere in the middle. He has redeeming qualities as well as things that he probably has to answer for at some point.” Gordon-Levitt, widely seen as a Hollywood nice guy, is cast against type to great effect. At some moments the viewer sees his vulnerability and complex family relationships and roots for him to succeed; at others, we wince at his gigantic ego and callous treatment of drivers and passengers as commodities. After the first episode was broadcast, Isaac received text messages from sources saying the actor nailed Kalanick perfectly. “Travis is a ruthless person, very driven; megalomaniac is probably a good way to describe him. “But I also think that you wouldn’t understand that he has nuance to him if you were just reading the headlines from 2017. So I saw them bringing in Joe as someone who could bring depth to the character and round him out in a way that’s not one-dimensional was really important.” Gordon-Levitt’s performance renders Kalanick as a swashbuckling, visionary businessman facing down opponents through sheer force of will; but also as the boss from hell willing to belittle and insult his employees without pity. Isaac adds: “He was very good at explaining the math and theory behind why it all worked out, but lacked a kind of empathy for the people directly involved a lot of the time. “It’s one of these things where he’s a brilliant guy and lives in a sort of fantastical world of how things should be, but isn’t able to connect on an emotional level to someone who’s struggling, or be able to empathise in the moment with someone who’s going through a hard time.” At one point in the series, Gurley observes: “The best thing about Travis is he’ll run through walls to win. The worst thing about him is he thinks everything’s a wall.” Like a politician who is great at campaigning but terrible at governing, the qualities in Kalanick that helped Uber rise proved useless once it reached the top. In fact, they planted seeds of self-destruction. Isaac says: “The problem with Travis is that he always felt like he was an underdog and fighting and in one mode, and that’s good while you’re coming up. But Uber eventually won, it became ubiquitous and it destroyed the taxi industry, and he wasn’t able to change out of that fighting mode into a normal, ‘OK, we can be peaceful and operate in cities without having to fight everyone.’ “Maybe there’s a different version of history if he would have been able to grasp that it’s kind of a tragedy because he wasn’t able to see it until it was too late.” A similar ambivalence hovers over the legacy of Uber, Lyft and other apps that some regard as avatars of progress, much as the motor car rendered the horse and carriage obsolete, and others say are new weapons of capitalist exploitation. The gig economy is worth more than $5tn a year worldwide and was accelerated further by the pandemic but offers little by way of trade unions or safety net. Isaac reflects: “A lot of folks ask would Uber be Uber if it weren’t for Travis? Can you will a sector like this into being when the folks who are entrenched in the first place aren’t going to let you play ball? Is there a nicer version of Uber that could have come into being? “There are a lot of amazing things that the company has done just in providing transport for folks who maybe were too scared to get home when they get off work at two in the morning and don’t want to wait for the bus. I know a lot of folks who have to do that sort of terrible commute and feel safer doing an Uber. “But then there are also the folks who feel that they’re exploiting workers, and [that] this model might not be good for workers in the long run. Like many different kinds of new innovations in the world, it brings with it a host of issues. Like anything with Uber, it’s never easy or straightforward.” Today, Uber has around 118 million monthly active users around the world while Kalanick is still a billionaire and running a property development company. Super Pumped is a new take on an old question: can you be a nice guy chief executive and still make world changing things happen? Isaac comments: “For really big swings and big moonshot ideas, you kind of have to be a little … if not crazy, then at least an eternal optimist. It takes a lot to believe in this mission. “That’s why you get these larger-than-life personalities. I don’t think it’s an accident that they tend to go hand-in-hand.” Another perspective is offered by journalist Brad Stone, author of The Upstarts: How Uber, Airbnb, and the Killer Companies of the New Silicon Valley Are Changing the World, who has interviewed and dined with Kalanick. He says by phone: “He was confident to the point of maybe arrogance, but a lot of entrepreneurs are. There was a lot of swagger and there had to be because they were trying to change a pretty big industry. “The whole thing was put on steroids. Suddenly, the speed at which they went from a small startup in San Francisco and Washington trying to fight regulators to being valued at $50bn and having thousands of employees, the wheels came off.” Stone adds: “At a certain point they just got besieged by not only their success but the culmination of all the mistakes and the problems with growing that fast – and the fact that his confidence did turn into hubris.” Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber continues on Sundays on Showtime with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘It’s kind of a tragedy’: behind the battle for power at Uber,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/05/uber-joseph-gordon-levitt-travis-kalanick-super-pumped
3/5/2022,"There are three reasons why the UK government has yet to show itself to be serious about sanctions against figures linked to Vladimir Putin’s regime in Russia. Together, they show the threat the UK poses to the effectiveness of the international response to the invasion of Ukraine. They also reflect the UK’s deep vulnerability to corruption, and the extent to which the UK continues to facilitate corruption and tax abuse all around the world. The UK government has participated, thus far, in the international response to Russia’s invasion. It is a signatory with the EU and US to last week’s joint statement on “further restrictive measures” that may herald one of the most far-reaching steps to pierce financial secrecy. But Britain’s own action on oligarchs has been criticised by Labour, and by Tory backbenchers, as paltry by comparison with those of its allies. While the EU has now blacklisted a clutch of billionaires, including Russia’s richest man, Alexei Mordashov, Boris Johnson’s government has been timid. The most significant new name on the UK list is Alisher Usmanov, added on Thursday night, in an announcement rushed out minutes before President Joe Biden revealed the US would join the EU in blacklisting the metals tycoon. The first reason for this lack of ambition may be the simplest. The Conservative party has long received funding from figures connected to – or at the absolute minimum, rich after association with – the Putin regime. Political donations may or may not lead to direct influence. With certainty, however, and much like the ownership of leading football clubs, they raise profile and a sense of being part of the establishment. The second reason is closely related, and more substantive. Being part of the establishment reduces the sorts of difficult questions that may be asked – for example, over the source of your money, or your appropriateness as a client for professional services firms, or whether your company should be allowed to raise funds on an international stock market like London. Russian business interests are embedded in the City of London. Lobby group TheCityUK played a central role in establishing the Moscow International Financial Centre, with successive London lord mayors co-chairing the “Joint Liaison Group”. London was until this week a huge market for trading in the shares of Russian companies. All of this has created strong financial incentives to limit the extent of any sanctions. The third reason for the UK dragging its heels is the deepest, and again entirely related. Together with its Overseas Territories like Cayman and its Crown Dependencies like Jersey, the UK is the biggest actor globally in the provision of financial secrecy services – leading to an estimated tax loss worldwide of some $190bn annually. And there is still, in certain circles, a Brexit vision of the UK as the big tax haven between the EU and the US (less Singapore-on-Thames, more Caymans on steroids). Leading the charge on effective sanctions against Russian money would threaten that vision. So too would a meaningful outcome for the transatlantic taskforce, proposed in Saturday’s joint statement on sanctions against Russia, that is intended to clamp down on anonymous assets. Other measures are needed. The Tax Justice Network has now laid out 10 key steps that the taskforce could pursue to introduce and tighten up the reporting and verification of beneficial ownership, culminating in a global asset registry that could end anonymous wealth once and for all. A UK that joins the fight against illicit finance is a UK that finally closes the door on its tax haven empire. But for each of the three reasons above, it’s hard to imagine that the current UK government will commit to this. Alex Cobham is chief executive of the Tax Justice Network",Opinion/Opinion,UK’s vulnerability to corruption uncovered amid slow sanctions response,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/05/uks-vulnerability-to-corruption-uncovered-amid-slow-sanctions-response
3/5/2022,"David Miliband, the head of one of the world’s largest humanitarian aid groups, has called on western governments to meet their moral responsibilities amid the massive exodus of refugees from Ukraine, singling out the UK for its restrictive visa policy which he called unjustifiable and “quite wrong”. In an interview with the Guardian, the former British foreign secretary warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was likely to cause “much, much more suffering”. He said the lightning speed of the refugee exodus, with 1 million Ukrainians having fled the country in just one week, had added to the trauma. The International Rescue Committee which Miliband directs is operating on the ground in Poland where the rapidly intensifying refugee crisis is focused. He called on European countries to step up and agree a refugee resettlement framework that could meet the scale of the disaster, and urged the US to play its part by reclaiming its historic leadership on asylum after the decimation of the Trump years. But he reserved his sharpest words for the British government and its relatively restrictive approach to Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s brutal attack on their country. Under growing pressure, Boris Johnson’s government has increased to 200,000 the number of Ukrainian nationals it will allow to enter, but the visas are conditional on applicants having direct ties to family or businesses in the UK. “There’s no justification for saying that unless you have a link to the UK you can’t come in,” Miliband said. “We know that the vast bulk of refugees always end up in countries neighbouring those they flee, so what is Britain afraid of? The British people aren’t afraid of Ukrainians claiming refugee status, and the British government shouldn’t be afraid either.” The UK’s relatively parsimonious response has set it apart from EU countries including Ireland which have introduced a visa waiver scheme. Miliband accused the UK government of lagging behind other European states. “We are clearly lagging behind when it comes to the financial aspects of London’s role as a place where Russians have brought money. We are equally clearly lagging when it comes to the refugee question, with Britain allowing a very low number of refugees in.” He added: “We are putting up walls against Ukrainians at a time when there is national unity deploring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and that’s quite wrong.” With the Ukrainians putting up fierce resistance that has bogged down Vladimir Putin’s all-out assault, there are signs that the Russian president is turning to even more brutal military tactics. Miliband said the Russian president was attempting a “pulverisation” of Ukrainian cities that was “an absolute horror show”. “We’ve seen this move before in Aleppo and Grozny. It’s not just heartless, it’s ruthless and unflinching and a hell of a lot of people are really going to suffer.” The fundamental lesson of the crisis, he said, was that the refugees fleeing Ukraine were from all walks of life. “They are journalists, charity workers, teachers, business people, housewives, physical trainers, accountants, pensioners – people who a week ago were leading perfectly normal lives are now on the run.” He praised what he called the “extraordinary waking up of Europe over the last week” that had produced rare unity on the refugee question that previously did not exist. “It’s vital to capitalise on that. Europe is not going to be overwhelmed by Ukrainians even if 5m of them come through.” But there were aspects of Europe’s response to the Ukraine crisis that the IRC chief said warranted reflection. He was struck by the contrast between the European unity currently on display in welcoming Ukrainians and the disunity and hostility shown towards Syrian and Afghan refugees on the Belarus-Poland border last year. “There’s no question that governments in Poland and Hungary took a very negative view of European responsibility towards Syrian refugees. But my point is, let’s build on the present unity.” Miliband also lamented the treatment of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people, many of whom are students, who have been abused and attacked as they attempt to escape Ukraine and cross into Poland. “These reports are worse than disturbing, they are appalling. Discrimination against people who are fleeing is directly contradictory not just to international law but to everything this crisis summons about a clash of views.” In the US, the Biden administration has granted permission for Ukrainians who entered before 1 March to stay and work for 18 months under a scheme known as temporary protected status. Miliband praised Biden for taking a more positive stance following Donald Trump’s savage cuts to the refugee programme. But he called on Washington to step up as part of the global response to the humanitarian catastrophe. “The US needs to be part of that. The streamlining and modernization of its refugee resettlement process needs to go forward at full speed.” Miliband was UK foreign secretary between 2007 and 2010. At that time Putin, for term-limit reasons, had stepped down from the Russian presidency to be prime minister though he remained in effective control. His years as Britain’s foreign policy supremo have led Miliband to reflect on the strong sense of what he calls “victimhood” that he believes is held by Putin and his inner circle. “It’s hard to exaggerate the extent to which the Russian political elite have got it into their heads that they have been stabbed in the back.” Victimhood had become fused with a second toxic emotion – contempt for the west, he said. Together, they fuelled Putin’s desire to turn the clock back to the immediate post-Soviet era of 1990 when greater Russia was the dominant hegemonic power in eastern Europe. “The attempt to turn the clock back by 30 years is also going to influence the next 30 years,” he said. “If indeed president Putin has overreached and summoned a rebirth of the spirit that saw the fall of the Berlin Wall, that’s very significant and will have global consequences.”",News/World news,‘Quite wrong’: David Miliband singles out UK’s visa policy on Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/quite-wrong-david-miliband-singles-out-uks-visa-policy-on-ukrainian-refugees
3/5/2022,"Every postwar British leader has seen the Middle East as a threatening place. They worried about the loss of empire and the risk of having oil supplies cut off; made bombastic claims about new Hitlers and transnational terrorism. But whatever the specific issues of the day, one thing has been remarkably consistent: most prime ministers since the second world war have overseen some kind of military intervention in the Middle East. That is one of the most striking themes of Nigel Ashton’s fascinating book on the beliefs and relationships that shaped British prime ministers’ policies in the region, from the Suez crisis to the Arab uprisings. Diary entries, telegrams, diplomatic records and, where possible, interviews with aides and advisers help bring out the psychology, preoccupations and prejudices that framed British decision making. The result is an empathetic but not a sympathetic account. In almost every chapter Ashton identifies a tendency to approach the Middle East with a mix of fear and hubris. Even as they saw the region as dangerous, British leaders ensured that their troops and officials were frequently entangled in it. Long after the formal structures of empire came to an end, an assumption persisted that Britain should and would have a role in shaping the region. In the early 1950s, a diplomat wrote of lying awake at night, fearing that all of Asia was moving out of Britain’s orbit, and that “our western civilisation will be soon strangled and subjected, with its bombs unusable in its pocket”. Ashton deftly sketches successive leaders’ romanticised views of the Middle East as the cradle of “Judeo-Christian values” and as a last bastion of empire (James Callaghan told a journalist that Suez had been a worse disaster than the loss of the American colonies). Meanwhile, successive British prime ministers framed populist Arab leaders as “Hitlers” or “Mussolinis”, casting them as oriental despots.Fearing Arab nationalism’s potential to unite the region and change the terms of trade for oil, Anthony Eden sought to overthrow the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser even before the Suez crisis. When the latter eventually seized the canal, Eden told US president Dwight Eisenhower that it was the 1930s all over again: it threatened an “ignoble end” to Britain’s long history as the leader of Europe in the fight for freedom. Eisenhower was apparently baffled by the overblown sense of existential threat. Meanwhile, MI6 aimed to engineer a coup in Syria, just a few years after the US and UK had backed the coup against prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh of Iran. Such attempts to maintain control in fact sowed the seeds of lasting mistrust. The Hitler comparison was used repeatedly; for Nasser, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Yet, depending on the assessments of different prime ministers, similar leaders – or indeed, the very same leaders – would be framed as moderate forces for stability. While numerous books have covered the Arab-Israeli wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, Ashton’s book provides a useful account of the smaller, subtler interventions, such as Britain’s covert operations in Yemen in the 1960s, fighting the Dhofar rebels in Oman in the 60s and 70s, and sending rapid support to the governments of Jordan and Kuwait when they felt threatened, well before the days of Saddam. Relations with Israel were shaped in part by close relations between leaders, with Callaghan in particular developing a deep bond of trust with his Israeli counterpart, Menachem Begin. In other cases, a sense of shared values or moral mission loomed large. Gordon Brown grew up seeing slides of the Holy Land as a place of pilgrimage for his preacher father. Margaret Thatcher’s father, a lay preacher, imbued her with a strong commitment to what she called Judeo-Christian values, even if her first meeting with an Israeli prime minister – Begin – was a tense one, since she saw him as responsible for past terrorism against British officers. Britain’s “frenemy” relationship with the US, its closest ally yet biggest rival in the region, was a persistent driver of prime ministerial ambitions and anxieties. Eden privately fumed that the US thought Britain was imperialist but took American interests to be “virginal”. Every leader pursued some kind of partnership as the US emerged as the world’s largest economy and military power, out of a mix of necessity, shared interests and personal rapport. But only Tony Blair supported standing “shoulder to shoulder” with the US. A full-throated evangelist for the alliance as a force for global good, he is portrayed by Ashton as following the lead of Churchill, who saw the “special relationship” as having a mission to combat the “peril to Christian civilisation”. Blair, who did not conceive of himself as a man nostalgic for empire, framed the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan as a liberation of local populations that would bring peace and democracy. But many in the region – where the legacy of empire is prominent in the public consciousness – saw them as simply a continuation of imperial “civilising” discourses used as a rationale for violence and dominance. The decades after the second world war are often portrayed as an uninterrupted period of global peace and prosperity, but the Middle East has been beset by conflicts. One of the problems is that big powers use the region as a place to play out their own rivalries, with the game enabled by weak states whose rulers are used to foreign cash and arms. The fact that foreign powers then portray the Middle East as uniquely troubled indicates a striking blindness to their own role. Ashton’s book makes this clear at a very human level. While the study of international relations often focuses on states that are presumed to act out of self-interest, detailed research like this reveals them to be made up of fallible, busy people, who have incomplete information and, are acting under pressure, cannot foresee the full consequences of their actions and have very different ideas of what the “national interest” actually means. And as so often with people who feel threatened, they rarely seem to appreciate that, for those in the region, the threat mostly seems to be coming the other way.
