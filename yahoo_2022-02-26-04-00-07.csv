2/26/2022,"A tense confrontation between the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol and Kimberly Guilfoyle unfolded privately on Friday morning, with Guilfoyle and her lawyers abruptly ending her conversation with the committee over concerns about its ground rules, according to four people familiar with the exchange. Guilfoyle, a longtime adviser to former President Donald Trump, was scheduled to meet virtually with the committee on February 25, following discussions between the committee and her lawyers. Guilfoyle is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., the former president's eldest son, and is one of the most high-profile confidants of the Trump family to meet with the committee. She also spoke at the January 6, 2021, rally at the Ellipse near the White House and was backstage that day with the Trump family and administration officials. The four people familiar with Friday's exchange requested anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the deliberations. But, they said, when Guilfoyle appeared on Friday's virtual meeting, she and her lawyers grew immediately concerned when they saw who else was on the call, including lawmakers on the committee such as Representatives Adam Schiff of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, both Democrats. Guilfoyle spoke up and asked why members — and not just lawyers and committee staff — were on the call, three of the people said. ""Kim balked and said this isn't my understanding,"" one of the people said. A second person described her as ""outraged,"" since she believed this conversation was going to be more informative and not a formal deposition. ""This is not my understanding,"" Guilfoyle told the committee, and then said she would cease to continue the conversation until her lawyers had further discussions with the committee about the format, the people said. A spokesman for the committee declined to comment. When contacted for comment by CBS News, Joseph Tacopina, counsel for Guilfoyle, issued a statement accusing the committee of leaking details of the exchange. ""Ms. Guilfoyle, under threat of subpoena, agreed to meet exclusively with counsel for the Select Committee in a good faith effort to provide true and relevant evidence,"" the statement said. ""However, upon Ms. Guilfoyle's attendance, the Committee revealed its untrustworthiness, as members notorious for leaking information appeared. Then, while counsel briefly halted the meeting to address the matter, our concerns about the presence of the Committee's members were validated, as the Committee within less than two minutes leaked news of the break to the media, as Chairman [Bennie] Thompson did only a month earlier when revealing to the press that our client's phone records had been confidentially subpoenaed."" The statement went on to assert that when Guilfoyle's lawyers contacted the committee about this story, ""they too were shocked and appalled"" and believed this story was based on a politically-motivated ""leak."" ""It is now abundantly clear to us that their only real interest was to sandbag our client and use today's interview as a political weapon against President Trump and those who support him,"" the statement said. While Guilfoyle has not been issued a subpoena by the committee, she agreed to Friday's conversation with the understanding that a subpoena could be issued if she did not engage with the committee, two of the people said. It is unclear whether Guilfoyle will reengage with the committee later Friday or in the coming days.

2/26/2022,"A container ship worker is going viral after showing just how long it takes to stop one of the massive, cargo-carrying boats. The U.K.-based seafarer, named Joe (@joethesailor), shared the shocking video on TikTok, where he frequently posts about his life as the chief officer on a container ship. His clip is just the latest in a recent trend on the app. For months, users have revealed the wildest facts about their jobs — from how much NFL water boys make a year to how workers fill ice skating rinks in the winter. Joe’s video, meanwhile, came in response to another TikToker’s question. As he explains, stopping his container ship when it’s at “full ahead” (a speed of 22.7 knots, or slightly over 26 miles per hour) takes a full 29 minutes. What’s more, the ship would cover a space of 4 miles as it stopped. Joe continues by explaining that figures like these are pre-calculated, and contained in a sheet called the “wheelhouse poster.” He also said that he could stop the ship faster if he really needed to, although it would likely damage the ship and make the engineers “scream” at him. TikTok users were stunned by the information. See this Manhattan apartment get an unbelievable maximalist makeover with just $1,000: “That actually blows my mind,” one user wrote. “29 minutes is insane.” “That is not a stop that’s slowing down,” another joked. Others used the opportunity to ask even more questions about Joe’s job. Thankfully, the TikToker has plenty of videos addressing his career — including one on how to steer a ship as large as his.

2/26/2022,"ADAZI MILITARY BASE, Latvia (Reuters) - The presence of U.S. and other NATO troops in Latvia sends a message to Vladimir Putin that Russia should stay away, Latvian Defence Minister Artis Pabriks said on Friday as he greeted a small deployment of U.S. soldiers. The group of some forty U.S. service members arrived from Italy early on Thursday - before hostilities in Ukraine began. The deployment is expected to grow to more than 300 soldiers. ""We are a small country. We are ready to do whatever is needed to defend ourselves. We are not afraid to die for that. But we might be overwhelmed, so this is very much why we welcome you here,"" Pabriks told the troops in Adazi military base on Friday. Russia invaded Ukraine by land sea and air on Thursday after massing more than 150,000 troops around the country's borders including in Latvia's neighbour Belarus. Latvia, together with Baltic neighbours Estonia and Lithuania, was once ruled by Moscow. They had long seen Russia as a security threat. But unlike Ukraine, the three countries joined the European Union and NATO, which brings security guarantees. NATO's founding treaty contains an article on collective defence stating that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all members. ""We are not afraid that somebody might invade us, but the signal that U.S. soldiers are with us, and that other allies, from Canadians to Europeans are with us, is a good signal to Putin - don't mess with us,"" Pabriks said. Over the past two days the United States has sent the troops to Latvia as well as advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to Lithuania and Estonia. It has also announced it will not be withdrawing 500 troops in Lithuania in April, as planned. About twenty U.S. Apache helicopters landed in Latvia on Wednesday.
