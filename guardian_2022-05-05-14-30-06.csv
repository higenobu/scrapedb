5/5/2022,"One of the most striking statements on climate change during the election campaign has come from an unlikely source – the owner of the country’s most power-hungry industrial plant. Tomago Aluminium, near Newcastle, consumes about 11% of all power generation in New South Wales. For years, its management has warned about the economic impact of policies to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. In the past, Tomago’s chief executive, Matt Howell, argued that a shift away from coal would push up prices and could lead to blackouts and the closure of the smelter. His argument that Australia would stop “making things” if it did not have baseload fossil fuel power was published on the front of the Daily Telegraph and praised by right-wing commentators including Peta Credlin and Ray Hadley. But times, and opinions, change. This week, Howell issued what was effectively a challenge to Australia’s biggest emitter, AGL Energy, to embrace renewable energy much more rapidly, and declared that Tomago was prepared to give up coal-fired power by the end of the decade. Given that wasn’t a scare campaign, it appeared on page 15 of the Australian, not the front of the News Corp Australia tabloids. Howell’s new position aligns with that of tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, who this week bought an 11.3% share of AGL as part of his campaign to stop the energy company from demerging and spinning off a new entity to run its aging and failing coal power plants. Cannon-Brookes wants AGL to head in the other direction: to stay as one, commit to closing coal generation by 2030 and go all-in on a renewable future. Tomago has a contract to run on AGL’s coal generation until 2028, but Howell said it was optimistic about the signing of a future deal under which it ran on renewable energy backed by “firming” capacity that can be called on whenever needed. He said that could be with AGL if it could deliver backed-up renewables at the right price. If that happens, it would have a significant impact on emissions in Australia’s biggest state and may lead to a coal plant – possibly Bayswater in NSW – shutting earlier than currently planned. Howell has flagged this shift before, last year telling the Australian Financial Review the company was in talks with renewable energy suppliers. But saying it during an election campaign – especially as the Morrison government is attempting to extend the “climate wars” by attacking Labor over the cost of a proposed accelerated roll-out of renewable energy – makes for a sharp contrast. If the country’s biggest industrial players are focusing on how quickly climate solutions can be put in place, why isn’t the political and media debate? A reliable electricity supply is vital for an aluminium smelter given its equipment can quickly freeze in a blackout – and cost vast sums to fix or replace. The key question facing Howell is whether it is possible to run a smelter the size of Tomago on renewable energy plus firming by the end of the decade. Experts say it is, though coming up with a contract to do it wouldn’t be straightforward. Tony Wood, the energy program manager at the Grattan Institute, says Tomago will be trying to answer two questions: will it have a constant physical electricity supply and who will carry the financial risk under any future contract? “You could see how it could run on a combination of wind and solar, with maybe some role for battery storage, but more likely backed up by something like Snowy Hydro or gas,” Wood says. Tristan Edis, from Green Energy Markets, suspects Tomago’s electricity needs could be managed through a portfolio of energy projects delivered by a big player in the energy market, such as Neoen, AGL or Iberdrola. He says the electricity provider would have to be able to “deliver and cleverly manage the weather and commercial risk”. “Alternatively it might be a state government or Snowy Hydro using a blend of owned and contracted projects,” he says. “During daytime, we’ll have plenty of solar, even in winter. Then you pull together a blend of wind farms located across New England, the central west and ideally south-west to get some diversity.” He says a big battery could be used to cover the “four-hour high price period” between 4pm and 8pm. “Lastly, buy a hedge contract from Snowy Hydro. Job done.” Rising the flag for coal power, still Nationals renegade Matt Canavan is no stranger to extravagant claims about climate change and coal power and has been busy keeping his opponents within the Coalition focused on it during the election campaign. As well as saying the net zero emissions by 2050 target was “dead”, he has taken to social media to point out that electricity prices are increasing. This is not consistent with the government’s narrative, which remains that they are down 8% on its watch. In a Facebook post last week, the Queensland senator said average power prices in NSW in the first three weeks of April were more than triple what they were a year ago. He blamed the increase on the closure of the first unit to go at the Liddell coal plant, which is scheduled to shut across the next year. His conclusion? “We need to build new coal power stations to replace the old ones.” The reality is, of course, more complicated, and headed in the opposite direction. As the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) reported last week, wholesale electricity prices are up sharply due to operational failures across a number of coal plants in NSW and Queensland, and because black coal and gas prices jumped following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Australian consumers are exposed to global markets. Studies have found the cheapest form of new generation is solar and wind backed by “firming” from a range of sources. In some cases, new renewable energy is even cheaper than existing fossil fuels. Energy companies, banks and regulators alike agree high-polluting coal-fired power is increasingly economically and environmentally unviable – and not necessary. Aemo, in a blueprint for an optimal power grid, has suggested coal plants could exit the system much faster than current announcements suggest.",News/Environment,Australia’s biggest industrial players are focusing on climate solutions – why isn’t the political debate? | Temperature Check,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/australias-biggest-industrial-players-are-focusing-on-climate-solutions-why-isnt-the-political-debate

5/5/2022,"One of the world’s leading coral reef scientists has called on the agency responsible for managing the Great Barrier Reef to release maps showing the extent of coral bleaching, after a key report was delayed with no reason given. Aerial surveys of the sixth mass bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef were completed in March and are yet to be released. Previous events have been published within two weeks of completion. The Sydney Morning Herald reported on Thursday that a reef snapshot report on the summer of 2021-22 – which contains the results of the surveys – had been delayed, with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority telling the newspaper it was unlikely to be released before the federal election. The aerial surveys pinpoint the locations on the world heritage reef that have been affected by the bleaching, the first to occur under La Niña conditions. The reef is divided into four management areas and the authority confirmed in March there was widespread bleaching in all four zones. Prof Terry Hughes, from James Cook University, has conducted the aerial surveys during previous mass bleaching years and said he typically made the maps available within 10 days. He questioned why they had not been released, along with another major environmental report – the five-yearly Australia State of the Environment Report – which has been finalised but not made public. “We’re not supposed to live in a secret society,” he said. “I think they should release it. There’s a strong similarity here to not releasing the State of the Environment report.” Hughes said GBRMPA had already verbally described the locations of the bleaching with the worst affected areas in the northern and central regions, with some areas in the south. He said the information in the report was significant because it would reiterate that the time for corals to recover between bleaching events was getting shorter. The six mass bleaching events that have occurred on the Great Barrier Reef were in 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. Hughes said “we will never see again” a 14-year gap between bleachings as occurred between the 2002 and 2016 events. He said the 2022 summer snapshot was also significant because this year’s event was the first time, due to global heating, that ocean temperatures had been warm enough to trigger bleaching during a La Niña. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Great Barrier Reef campaign manager at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Lissa Schindler, said the health of Australia’s reefs and environment was of enormous interest to voters. “If they are ready, these reports must be released,” she said. “It is vital scientists and Australian voters have up-to-date and transparent information about our environments so they are fully informed heading into an election.” A spokesperson for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said three agencies – GBRMPA, CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science – were working to release the reef snapshot and the timing was at the discretion of those agencies. “The government has not been offered a briefing on the snapshot and has not issued any instructions in relation to it,” the spokesperson said. Guardian Australia sought comment from GBRMPA. A GBRMPA spokesperson told the Sydney Morning Herald: “The Reef Summer Snapshot 2021-22 was due to be released several weeks ago but has been delayed. It’s the official report released annually that summarises how the reef has fared over summer and features the aerial surveys.”",News/Environment,Leading scientist calls for Great Barrier Reef coral bleaching report to be released before election,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/leading-scientist-calls-for-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-report-to-be-released-before-election
5/5/2022,"Care homes in England are demanding the return of full pay for staff isolating with Covid, saying the withdrawal of government funding has pushed carers to work while infected or to turn to food banks. The Care Provider Alliance (CPA) and Unison, which represents thousands of care staff, have called on the health secretary, Sajid Javid, to restart the adult social care infection control and testing fund, saying cancelling it in March was an “incredibly dangerous move [that] will cost lives”. They said some workers were turning to food banks or leaving for better-paid work because they could not afford to isolate, given rising inflation. Median pay for care workers in England was £9.01 an hour in 2020-21, just 29p higher than the “national living wage” in that period. The vacancy rate among social care workers has almost doubled in the past year to 10%, according to the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. Care operators said the trend was restricting discharges from hospitals, snarling up other NHS treatments. The original £1.75bn fund, which gave financial support to care providers in England so they could continue to pay full wages ​to isolating staff, was closed in March. A similar fund in Scotland has been extended until the end of June. “It is beyond belief that such a vital financial lifeline has been cut for low-paid staff trying to protect vulnerable people, particularly during the worst cost-of-living crisis in over 60 years,” said Martin Green, chair of the CPA, and Gavin Edwards, senior national officer at Unison, in a letter to the health secretary. “The government should be encouraging and rewarding staff for doing the right thing by self-isolating, not making it impossible for them to feed their families.” They said the care sector “remains under immense pressure as the virus continues to circulate”. “Major staff shortages are directly undermining the quality of care provided across England,” they said. “They are also preventing the NHS from discharging patients back into the community, consequently limiting access to medical services and piling more pressure on the system.” At least 2,700 care workers are currently absent with Covid in England, according to the national capacity tracker. That is likely to be an undercount as, since the infection control fund was withdrawn, providers are no longer being paid to complete the tracker. Forty-five providers reported red alerts on workforce capacity, which means workforce level ratios had been breached. The number of care homes reporting Covid outbreaks has fallen steadily over the past month to 272, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s weekly surveillance report. But there were 135 deaths in care homes involving Covid in the last week for which data from the Care Quality Commission was available, a figure consistent with 100 to 200 deaths a week from Covid in care homes recorded since the start of the year. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “The vast majority of care workers are employed by private-sector providers, who determine their pay, terms and conditions of employment. All care providers should support good health and safety practice, including encouraging staff staying away from the workplace when there would be a health risk to those in their care, as they would have done before the pandemic.”",News/Society,Care homes in England demand revival of Covid fund to pay isolating staff,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/care-homes-in-england-demand-revival-of-covid-fund-to-pay-isolating-staff
5/5/2022,"Officials under police investigation over lockdown breaches in Downing Street have expressed frustration after it emerged that Boris Johnson has not yet received a questionnaire for at least one key leaving do. Amid growing anger at what one official branded a “scattergun approach” by Scotland Yard – including different people being sent questionnaires two months apart for the same event – the Metropolitan police are expected to make an announcement soon after the local elections, with expectations of further Partygate fines. The prime minister said on Tuesday he had not been contacted by the Met about a leaving party for his former spin doctor Lee Cain in November 2020. Sources said Met questionnaires, which can be a precursor to a fixed-penalty notice (FPN), had been sent to other people who attended. Johnson gave a speech and poured drinks at the leaving event for Cain on 13 November, according to those present, despite it being during a stay-at-home Covid lockdown. Police are also investigating an alleged party on the same night, held at the flat the prime minister shares with his wife, Carrie Johnson. Sources claim the event was to celebrate the departure of Cain and Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings. The prime minister has so far received one FPN, for attending a birthday gathering at No 10 in June 2020 for what he said was a matter of minutes, demonstrating that police deemed this crossed the threshold for breaking the law. Scotland Yard’s approach to the Partygate investigation, Operation Hillman, has also frustrated MPs. “The Met have blundered from the beginning, abdicating responsibility to [the senior civil servant] Sue Gray and then inserting themselves back into the narrative at just the moment we were approaching a resolution,” one MP said. “Given the seriousness of the potential findings, the Met really must set out a sensible timetable for bringing their investigation to a conclusion.” Junior Downing Street staffers, who have received multiple questionnaires already from the Met, say there is significant disquiet about why Johnson has not been investigated over the same events, and the way the inquiry has been conducted. “It feels there has been significant consideration about how to cause the least political impact – when someone is being investigated for a criminal offence,” an ex-official said. “How is this allowed to happen?” Another said it was “disgraceful how police are stringing this out, it’s a scandal of historic proportions”. A Whitehall source brought up how the investigation had affected others who attended gatherings, including the civil servant Kate Josephs who has taken leave from a new role at Sheffield city council after her December 2020 Cabinet Office leaving party was identified as a lockdown breach. One complication raised by a Whitehall source was the fact that police inquiries began with evidence gathered by Gray, the civil servant initially given the task of looking into alleged wrongdoing. She is believed to have gathered some details of events by speaking to a handful of attenders who volunteered information. Some officials who played relatively minor roles in gatherings now faced police action after assisting Gray, whereas others whose offences were arguably greater had not been contacted by officers. Asked by Times Radio on Tuesday whether he had received a Met questionnaire about the November 2020 leaving party, Johnson said: “I am not commenting on this stuff generally, but the answer to that is no, not so far, or certainly not to my knowledge. All of this will become clear with the end of the investigation.” Johnson has been fined – along with Carrie Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak – over his birthday cake gathering. However, he does not appear to have been fined over a “bring your own booze” party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020, for which others have been fined. In January, Johnson admitted attending the event – held during the first national lockdown when indoor and outdoor social mixing were banned – for about 25 minutes but claimed he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. His principal private secretary at the time, Martin Reynolds, is said to have invited up to 100 people to the “socially distanced” evening drinks. Officials involved in the gatherings under investigation believe it is likely that Johnson will get another two fines – one for Cain’s leaving do and another for the flat party on the same evening. However, Johnson is reported to be convinced he will not receive any further fines.

5/5/2022,"The chief executive of the craft beer company BrewDog, James Watt, has brought a private prosecution against a woman who he claims provided false information about who was responsible for “malicious” comments made about him on social media. In a pre-trial hearing at Westminster magistrates court, lawyers acting for Watt set out the allegations against Emili Ziem, accusing her of fraud and malicious communication. Lawyers for Ziem, 29, a Brazilian and Japanese citizen, indicated that she is preparing to contest the claims and will not comment on the details of the case while proceedings are active. The first charge, of fraud, accuses her of “dishonesty”, saying that she had obtained information about “people responsible for malicious communications” about Watt. It is said that she was “intending to make a gain” for herself and to cause loss to him, or expose him to the risk of loss. The second charge, of malicious communication, accuses her of sending posts from an Instagram account with the username Laurakeller341 “which conveyed information which was false and which you knew or believed to be false for the purpose of causing distress or anxiety to the recipient or to any other person to whom you intended that it or its contents or nature should be communicated”. Ziem, who has no permanent UK address and gave an address in Norway, has indicated that she disputes both the allegations. She was granted bail with no restrictions. The case was allocated to Southwark crown court for a further pre-trial hearing on 1 June. A spokesperson for Watt, contacted after hearing, said: “We cannot comment on a live criminal case.” The case is a private prosecution brought by Watt, rather than his company BrewDog, which is Britain’s largest craft brewer. Cofounded by Watt in 2007, it has grown to be valued at more than £2bn, with about 2,000 staff, more than 100 bars around the world and beers stocked in major supermarkets including Tesco. A private prosecution is one initiated by a private individual or entity, rather than someone acting on behalf of the police or other prosecuting authority. In some cases, the Crown Prosecution Service will take over the prosecution but it can still proceed even if this not the case. The CPS can also stop a private prosecution from going ahead under a range of circumstances.

5/5/2022,"When most people toss a plastic bottle or cup into the recycling bin, they assume that means the plastic is recycled – but a new report lays bare how rarely that actually happens. According to the Last Beach Cleanup and Beyond Plastics, the organization behind the report released on Wednesday, the recycling rate for post-consumer plastic was just 5% to 6% in 2021. The Department of Energy also released a research paper this week, which analyzed data from 2019, and came to the same number: only 5% of plastics are being recycled. The researchers on that report wrote that landfilled plastic waste in the United States has been on the rise for many reasons, including “low recycling rates, population growth, consumer preference for single-use plastics, and low disposal fees in certain parts of the country”, according to a press release. The problem has also been exacerbated by shifts in the global recycling market, including China’s 2017 ban on most US plastic exports. Countries such as China used to accept ships full of plastic waste from the US, says Jan Dell, founder of the Last Beach Cleanup, but without that option, more plastic is ending up thrown away, since few US facilities have the capacity to recycle it. “The rate of plastic recycling in the US has never been about 4% to 5% ever,” she says. “We don’t have factories to do it. It’s also very water intensive, so we’re not going to build more plastic recycling facilities in the US.” Around 85% of plastics end up in landfills, and the remaining 10% are incinerated, according to Dell’s research. And even when plastics are recycled, about a third of the material from a PET plastic bottle is discarded in the process. The Last Beach Cleanup and Beyond Plastics’s report also revealed that while plastic recycling is on the decline, the generation of plastic waste per person in the US has increased by 263% since 1980, from 60 pounds a person to 218 pounds a person, according to the report. Plastics stand out as egregiously wasteful in the world of recycling: paper is recycled at 66%, according to the American Forest and Products Association, while the figure for aluminum cans is about 50.4%, according to the EPA. “We can’t stay in the single use plastic nightmare scenario that we are right now,” says Dell. “There’s no way to sort our way out of this without reducing waste to start with.” Dell says that solutions exist to replace single-use plastics – for example, fiber-based food trays that can be composted or recycled. She says Nestle has replaced plastic with paper on candy in the UK – something they’re calling “paperification”. And of course, reusing and refilling bottles rather than tossing them after use also helps. She adds that the plastic producers have really been deceptive in slapping the triangular “chasing arrows” shape on the bottom of products and misleading people into thinking they are recyclable, when in fact the symbol does not guarantee that. “They have co-opted America’s love of recycling and the thought that we are doing something good for the environment, when they knew all along it wasn’t recycling,” she says. “They leveraged the heartstrings of consumers and said this stuff was recyclable.” Bans on single-use plastic items such as bags, food containers and utensils are increasingly popular, with versions adopted in places including the European Union, the state of California, and Los Angeles. But such rules need to go further, the report says. “Proven solutions that will reduce US plastic waste and pollution already exist and can be swiftly enacted. The success of single-use plastic bans, water refilling stations, and reusable food and dish ware can be extended nationwide.”",News/US news,"US is recycling just 5% of its plastic waste, studies show ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/us-recycling-plastic-waste
5/5/2022,"There is one question that counts when you cast your vote: have they made life better? This month, the Conservatives will have been in office for 12 years. Today, in the local elections, we have a chance to pass judgment on their record. What does it look like? It’s an astonishing thing, but it is genuinely hard to think of government policies that, in this period, have improved life for people other than the richest and most privileged. There are a handful. There’s the same-sex marriage legislation passed during David Cameron’s first term, though it was developed by the Liberal Democrats and opposed by a majority of Conservative MPs. There’s a higher threshold for paying income tax, a higher minimum wage (though it falls short of a genuine living wage), shared parental leave and automatic pensions enrolment. There’s the Modern Slavery Act 2015, no-fault divorces, the law against coercive behaviour, an improved highway code, the carbon floor price, the soft drinks levy and payments for plastic bags. Cameron oversaw a successful Olympics, and Boris Johnson’s government executed an effective vaccination programme. To this brief list, we could add a few policies that might be positive in principle, and have managed to deliver some improvements, but have been disastrously designed and implemented. These include universal credit, increased hours for free childcare, furlough payments and net zero. But that’s about it: remarkably slim pickings across 12 years of government. Weighed against these benefits is an astounding litany of harm. As the elections on 5 May are for council seats, let’s take a look at what has happened to local authorities. Since 2010, they have suffered cuts in central government funding of almost 60%. This has caused devastating losses to local services, including Sure Start children’s centres, youth and community services, respite care, libraries, local buses, recycling, arts and culture. And it’s not over: further massive cuts are expected next year. Several councils are now close to bankruptcy and must sell the last of their assets. The poorest boroughs have been hardest hit – so much for levelling up. The social fabric of the nation has been torn apart. Why? Obviously, they’ll tell you, to save money. If so, why have they been lavishing cash on pet projects and favoured interests? As Cameron and George Osborne ripped into public budgets, they somehow found £2bn for a pointless and chaotic reorganisation of the NHS. They spent £4.5 bn a year on the Afghan war, for reasons they could never clearly define; with this money they could have cancelled either their entire public-sector pay freeze or the cut to the universal credit budget – and still have a billion in change. For the price of one or two contracts issued to ministers’ friends through the dodgy Covid “VIP channel”, the current government could have reversed all the losses to the Arts Council’s budget, or brought national spending on libraries back to its 2010 level. Of the £12.1bn of protective equipment the government bought in 2020-21, it wrote off £8.7bn, thanks to the disastrous cronyism of procurement policies. That’s roughly six times the national budget for rebuilding schools in England. Abandoning due diligence during the pandemic, against the advice of civil servants and other experts, the Conservative government managed to lose an estimated £3.5bn in bounceback loans to fraud while £5.2bn of furlough payments also ended up in the hands of fraudsters or was paid in error. It appears to have made little effort to recover these stolen funds. The budget for the test-and-trace scheme – £37bn – which, according to the public accounts committee, has achieved none of its aims and failed to make “a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic”, equates to more than twice the entire cut across 10 years in the central government grant to local authorities. For the same money, we could have avoided all that suffering, all the losses in services and the damage to civic and community life, and still had £22bn in change. The Conservatives’ austerity programmes have little to do with saving money. They’re inspired by an ideology called neoliberalism, which seeks to destroy the very notion of effective government. This social vivisection, carving up a living society to see if its parts can survive in isolation, has been devastating to the people whom governments have the greatest duty to protect – the poor and vulnerable. Despite the pandemic, during which accommodation for rough sleepers magically materialised as soon as they were deemed a “health risk”, the number of people living on the streets is estimated to be 38% higher today than it was in 2010. A tiny fraction of the social housing we need is being built. The cruel benefits cap and bedroom tax have made piddling savings while inflicting enormous pain. The Malthusian two-child benefits limit imposed in 2017 delivers child poverty and nothing else. The number of food parcels supplied by the Trussell Trust has risen from 41,000 a year before the Conservatives took office to more than 2m today. Almost one in 10 parents expects to have to use a food bank this summer. Disgracefully but unsurprisingly, life expectancy in the most deprived areas has been falling since 2011. If you want a single indicator of government performance, this is it. The crisis in the NHS, caused by 12 years of dire underfunding, coupled with the pandemic backlog and, to be fair, the legacy of New Labour’s disastrous private finance schemes, is likely to accelerate this trend. Six million people in England – more than a 10th of the population – are now waiting for treatment, the highest number since records began. Patients are frequently stuck for 24 or even 48 hours in accident and emergency departments. Some wait hours for an ambulance after dialling 999. I could go on, discussing the truncation of civil liberties; the deliberate stoking of division through culture wars; the gross mishandling of the pandemic, causing tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths; Partygate and the destruction of public trust; the assault on public protections, leading, among other horrors, to the Grenfell Tower disaster; the administrative collapse across dozens of public services, exemplified by the current Passport Office fiasco and the transformation of our rivers into open sewers; a 14% increase in crime this year caused largely by fraud, against which there is now almost no recourse; the stalling of carbon cuts; oh, and the small matter of Brexit. This is the record on which we should be voting, in today’s elections and those that follow. The past 12 years of Conservative government have made the life of this nation worse. A lot worse.

5/5/2022,"The Bank of England is poised to raise interest rates to the highest level since the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis, despite mounting concern that the economy is weakening amid the cost of living crisis. City economists widely expect the Bank will increase its base rate by at least 0.25 percentage points to 1% on Thursday, lifting borrowing costs to the match the level set in February 2009 when it was in the process of cutting rates to historic lows as the global financial system imploded. Households across Britain are under intense pressure from soaring living costs – with inflation at 7%, the highest level since 1992 – driven by record petrol prices and rising gas and electricity costs exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Experts have warned the gauge for the annual jump in consumer prices could reach 10% later this year, five times the Bank’s 2% target. Central banks around the world have begun raising rates to combat high inflation. Analysts said the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) was set to vote overwhelmingly for its fourth consecutive rate rise since it began increasing borrowing costs in December for the first time since the Covid pandemic. Raising rates to 1% would also open the door to the Bank selling down some of its £875bn portfolio of UK government bonds built up through its quantitative easing stimulus programme since the 2008 financial crisis. With heightened volatility in financial markets over recent weeks, analysts said the Bank would probably lay the ground for future asset sales rather than take immediate action, although disposals of £5bn a month could be made from as early as the summer. Economists said some of the nine-strong panel could push for a 0.5 percentage point rise to show commitment to stopping persistently high rates of inflation from taking hold, although cautioned that a quarter-point rise was still most likely. Concerns are, however, growing that high inflation could give way to a recession should the soaring cost of living, rising taxes and higher borrowing costs severely damage UK consumer spending, in a development that would force the Bank to drastically reconsider plans for future rate rises. Signs of weakness have emerged in recent weeks, including an unexpectedly large decline in March retail sales and consumer confidence in April dropping to the second-lowest level in almost 50 years. Several leading economists said this could tempt Jon Cunliffe, the Bank’s deputy governor, to cast another lone vote to keep rates on hold after taking that position at the MPC’s last meeting in March. Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg, said a cautious approach was probably appropriate: “Amid plunging consumer confidence and evidence of a pullback in household demand, [raising rates] is not without risk, in our view. “If we are unlucky, the UK is already in the early stage of a recession.”",News/Business,Bank of England expected to raise interest rates despite faltering economy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/bank-of-england-expected-to-raise-interest-rates-despite-faltering-economy
5/5/2022,"The world’s birds, described as the planet’s “canaries in the coalmine”, are disappearing in large numbers as the colossal impact of humanity on the Earth grows, a global review has found. There are about 11,000 species of bird spanning the globe, but the populations of half of them are falling, while just 6% are increasing. Their flight and song make them easier to study than many animals, meaning they are the best studied large group. Bird populations are also affected by all the damage caused by human activity, from the destruction of wild habitat, the climate crisis, and pesticides and other pollution, to over-hunting and impacts of alien species and disease. This makes them the best living indicators of global change, the scientists said. Billions of birds have been lost in recent decades in North America and Europe alone, and while there are more species in the tropics, a higher proportion are at risk of extinction in temperate and largely richer nations, the review found. Conservation efforts have been successful at rescuing individual species in specific locations from the brink, but political will and funding are needed to reverse the global decline, the researchers said. “Birds are a much more powerful taxa [than others] to tell us a story about the health of the planet,” said Alexander Lees, at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK, and who led the review. “We know so much about them – we don’t even know how many insect species there are.” “Currently, we’re triaging the species at risk, but we’re not stopping the flow of species towards extinction,” he said. “There’s only so much we can do with site-based conservation.” While conservation work has improved populations of 70 species enough to lower their risk of extinction since 1988, 391 species have deteriorated, the review found. Global data collated by Birdlife International underpinned the review and the conservation group’s CEO, Patricia Zurita, said: “Birds truly are the canary in the coal mine as indicators for the health of our planet, given their sensitivity to ecosystem changes, their ubiquity around the planet, and how well studied they are. [We] need to listen and act upon what birds are telling us, as they disappear ever faster.” One exception to the broader decline is among water birds, where populations living in wetlands in North America and Europe have grown by 13% since 1970. The restoration of relatively small wetland areas can have a huge impact, while birds living in grasslands and forests need much bigger areas. The review, published in the journal Annual Review of Environment and Resources, found that 48% of bird species are known or suspected to be undergoing population declines, compared with 39% with flat trends, 6% showing increases and 7% with unknown trends. Most long-term data is from Europe, North America, India and some sites in Africa but more recent monitoring in Latin America and Asia shows similar results. The population of birds in the US and Canada has fallen by 3bn since 1970, while 600m have disappeared from Europe since 1980. The review notes the extraordinary range of birds, from Antarctic petrels nesting 200km inland in Antarctica to the Hornby’s storm-petrel found nesting in the Atacama desert. A Rüppell’s vulture has been reported flying at an altitude of 11,300 metres, while emperor penguins can dive more than 500 metres below the sea surface. Birds have huge cultural value but are also vital to ecosystems, including dispersing seeds and eating pests. Birds are affected by all the impacts of human activity. For example, 2.7m are estimated to die every year in Canada alone from eating pesticides, while domestic cats may kill 2.4bn a year in the US. The most threatened families of birds are those which are larger and take longer to reproduce, including parrots, albatrosses, cranes and stocky birds like the Australian brushturkey. All countries host at least one globally threatened bird species and 10 nations have more than 75, the review found. Farmland species are declining precipitously, the review said, down 57% in Europe since 1980. This is due to the intensive agriculture that supplies cheap food, Lees said, adding: “If we want farmers to farm wildlife, we have to pay for that as a society.” Individual species have been rescued, such as the Mauritius kestrel, which was down to one breeding female but has now been revived to a population of hundreds, and the Alagoas curassow in Brazil, which was extinct in the wild but has been restored from birds held by private collectors. But the review concluded: “The growing footprint of the human population represents the ultimate driver of most threats to avian biodiversity. A lack of progress in conserving [birds] usually reflects a lack of resources or political will, rather than a lack of knowledge of what needs to be done.” Prof Stuart Pimm, at Duke University, US, said the review was excellent and authoritative, even with the sparse availability of data in some regions. “What is certain is that about two-thirds of all bird species live in tropical forests, and human actions are shrinking those habitats,” said Pimm. “Even without detailed population estimates, their numbers are surely in decline.” Lees said people need not feel powerless in helping to reverse the decline but added: “We all have connections [to birds]. If a company is associated with deforestation in Brazil, don’t buy stuff from them,” he said. “And if everyone spares as much land as possible within their gardens for nature, then that adds up to quite a large area. Another lever is voting – we get the politicians we vote for.”",News/Environment,‘Canaries in the coalmine’: loss of birds signals changing planet,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/canaries-in-the-coalmine-loss-of-birds-signals-changing-planet
5/5/2022,"How much snow gets stuck in the branches of a tree? For hydrologists, it’s a question that matters because snow sitting on treetops is more likely to be melted by the sun or blown off by the wind, resulting in less snowpack on the ground and a smaller spring snowmelt. Researchers at Oregon State University have come up with an ingenious solution for estimating how much snow a tree intercepts, using accelerometers to measure the amount the tree sways. Taking measurements in a coniferous forest in Colorado, scientists have found that trees with heavily snow-laden branches sway more slowly. Comparing these measurements with meteorological data and photographs, they were able to use the amount of sway to calibrate how much weight the tree had gained via snow capture. “One of my colleagues calls it a Fitbit for trees,” says hydrologist Mark Raleigh from Oregon State University, whose findings are published in Water Resources Research. Previous studies have shown that as much as 60% of the snowfall can be intercepted by a conifer with a thick and luxurious crown. Their technique would need to be calibrated for different types of trees, but it could serve as a good way of monitoring snowstorms and improving hydrological forecasts.",News/News,Colorado conifers given ‘Fitbits’ to measure snow cover,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/05/colorado-conifers-given-fitbits-to-measure-snow-cover
5/5/2022,"It used to be pretty clear what landscape art was. Within the British tradition, it was artists such as Gainsborough, Constable or Turner who provided the default images of rural settings, and from them a line could be traced to the present day taking in a range of artists such as Paul Nash or Eric Ravilious. It was the accepted view well into the 20th century that this tradition – especially the masterpieces of the 18th and 19th centuries – represented something that was somehow safe, fixed and broadly reflective of the natural way of things. Radical Landscapes at Tate Liverpool, which, true to its title, has adopted an expanded and inclusive view of what landscape art is, unsurprisingly doesn’t include Gainsborough’s famous c1750 double portrait of Mr and Mrs Andrews on their grand estate. But it does include a video clip of John Berger critiquing the painting in his 1972 TV series Ways of Seeing. Essentially, Berger’s argument was that rather than reading the painting as a simple marriage celebration with the accompanying corn field symbolising fertility and so on, this was a bald celebration of property and private land, and a statement about who had access to it and who didn’t. As Berger points out, the painting was made at a time when a man who stole a potato risked a public whipping and the sentence for poaching was deportation. This spirit of questioning the ownership, use of and access to land animates a show that was initially conceived at the height of Brexit debates about identity, belonging and “taking back control”. Curator Darren Pih was interested in notions of thresholds and borders, as well as the reality of large areas of the UK being off limits to most people for a multitude of reasons, ranging from private ownership – including by offshore trusts – to militarisation and discrimination. As the exhibition developed, and after several Covid-related delays, it has moved to examine our relationship with land through the lenses of the pandemic, the climate emergency and nuclear threat, as well as more mystical and emotional bonds to the rural landscape. The links between access to land and class, race, gender and disability are likewise probed in a specific context of activism and protest. This wide brief is fulfilled by a suitably eclectic collection of more than 150 pieces of work, largely and imaginatively gathered from the Tate’s collection and augmented with some astute loans and commissions. The upshot is pleasingly surprising and diverse. Constable’s much confected depiction of Flatford Mill is to be found alongside banners made at the 1980s Greenham Common peace camp. Claude Cahun’s surreal photograph of a pair of arms emerging from a stone monolith sits near catalogues from the Festival of Britain. There’s an examination of the resource-efficient lives of the Romany community, and Peter Kennard’s Haywain with Cruise Missiles montage. Pih says he “wanted to explore why we have such an emotional attachment to land and why we protest when we see it being threatened”, and while the show nods to the history of the enclosures and Highland Clearances in Scotland, its real historical and political starting point is the rambling and then trespass movements of the early part of the last century, which culminated with the mass Kinder Scout trespass of 1932 in the Peak District. Led by ramblers and young communists, it eventually resulted in the establishment of national parks in the UK. Although clearly from a lineage of older rural protests, these mass trespasses were largely urban working-class attempts to access land at a time when cities were polluted and access to green space was limited yet essential to good health. The parallels with the pandemic are clear. The trespasses are represented in the show by 1930s press photographs. Images from half a century later, taken by Alan Lodge, of the confrontation now known as the Battle of the Beanfield between a convoy of new-age travellers heading to the 1985 Stonehenge free festival and the police, illustrate how the story continues. The notional focus of the Battle of the Beanfield, Stonehenge, reverberates around the exhibition with artists – Ravilious, Henry Moore, Tacita Dean and others – drawn to symbolically powerful aspects of landscape from henges and geoglyphs to ancient oak trees. Jeremy Deller, who has made films about henges and whose neon depiction of the Cerne Abbas giant is in the show alongside his acid house smileys made of straw, reflects that, “The beauty of most of these sites is that there is a sense of shared ownership, physically and conceptually. They’re this huge, mute mirror of Britain. Whatever your views about yourself or your country and humanity, you can project them on to these structures. For me, Stonehenge is the most contemporary structure in Britain, because every week, there seems to be a new story about it.” After the Battle of the Beanfield, the venues for contested mass assembly moved to the burgeoning rave scene, culminating in 1992 at the huge unlicensed gathering at Castlemorton (the show features rare film footage of the rave), which indirectly led to changes to civil liberties via the criminal justice bill. But legal battles around contested sites and access were only one way of restricting who could, or should, occupy these spaces. Issues of discrimination, exclusion and erasure are widely explored in the show. Ingrid Pollard, whose work has long revealed what has been hidden in plain sight in the landscape tradition – the absence of black figures – evokes themes of colonisation through family photographs. A film made by the neurodiverse collective Project Art Works explores another group often excluded from the traditional landscape narrative by following a group of neurodiverse artists, their families and carers for several days during a trip to a remote Scottish glen, again expanding the view of who has a right to enjoy the countryside. For there to be access to the natural world, that world needs to be cared for. The environmental strain in the show includes a newly commissioned installation from Delaine Le Bas, an artist of Romany heritage – another marginalised community often absent from landscape history. Rinkeni Pani (Beautiful Water) produces a sense of the artist using the pictorial conventions of landscape art, explains Pih, “but the work is also about climate change. Le Bas’s grandmother always told her to preserve precious water as part of a nomadic life that was also a way of low-impact living that valued precious natural resources. It’s another way of thinking about who is an activist.” Other large-scale installations include a newly commissioned piece by Davinia-Ann Robinson in which she uses salvaged soil to comment on land art as well as colonialism, and Ruth Ewan’s Back to the Fields, her reconstruction of the French Republican calendar, in use from 1793 to 1805, in which plants and objects from the natural world and from rural life – twine, a goat skull, a tree – represent a single day. A symbolic return of the land to the people, it is also a fascinating challenge to the Tate curators, who have to look after its living plants in the carefully regulated environment of a museum. In terms of the climate crisis, Gustav Metzger, now seen as a pioneer of environmental art, emerges as a key presence in the show with a striking, large 1998 photograph of the construction of the M3 carving through Twyford Down, Hampshire, surrounded by the caterpillar track of an earth mover. There is also a 1965 liquid crystal display powered by ambient heat. A member of CND’s direct action Committee of 100 in the early 60s, Metzger’s personal connection to humankind’s propensity for destruction – he was sent from Germany to the UK in 1939 aged 13 on the Kindertransport, and most of his immediate family perished in the Holocaust – strongly influenced his concerns about technology having the potential to bring environmental annihilation. The show’s broad canvas well illustrates the endless complexity and interconnectedness of issues related to land and landscapes. Maybe surprisingly, one of the featured artists who best straddles the apparent boundaries is Derek Jarman. He is represented by work – assemblage, photography, paint, film – made at Prospect Cottage, site of his seaside garden in Dungeness, Kent. But his career trajectory seems particularly apt for a show in which activism and rebellion are an intrinsic part of the relationship between nature and art. In the 70s, he had made work in response to Avebury and its standing stones before adopting a more activist and public role to offer a critique of Thatcherism. When he was diagnosed with HIV and became ill, he retreated to his cottage to access the recuperative and regenerative qualities of nature. While there, he created his now famous garden that, in its philosophy, public setting and beauty presented itself as useful an example as any of a radical landscape.

5/5/2022,"Australia needs to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy, the chief executive of the country’s second-biggest mining company, Rio Tinto, has said. “We’re just not developing renewable energy fast enough,” Jakob Stausholm said, speaking after Rio’s annual shareholder meeting in Melbourne. The miner is a big energy consumer, but is currently trying to convert the iron ore operations in the Pilbara that drive its profitability to green sources of energy. Stausholm said Rio had to focus on where it was getting energy from in the short term or it would be “creating problems” for itself. “We need energy,” he said. “If renewable energy goes slow, we cannot phase out fossil fuel.” Rio’s new chairperson, Dominic Barton, warned shareholders that an economic fissure between China and the west, similar to that which opened up with Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, was unlikely but would have horrendous consequences. Speaking at Rio’s annual meeting on Thursday, Barton said that the relationship with China, the company’s biggest customer and Australia’s no 1 export market for iron ore, was important. China has previously blocked Australian coal imports over the country’s support of US foreign policy. “If the world ever got to that point, if you think about the integration of the Chinese economy with the world economy, we are in a devastating situation,” he said. “The entire integration of the economies between China and the rest of the world is so deep, it is so completely different than Russia … I think it would be horrendous.” Stausholm told investors he is trying to reset the company’s culture after a disastrous two-year period that included blowing up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, stoushes with governments in Mongolia and Serbia and the exposure of a culture of racism, sexism and bullying within the global miner. The Juukan Gorge debacle cost his predecessor, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, his job and also led to the exit of much of the company’s top executive team. However, Rio Tinto remains financially strong, declaring record profits and dividends off the back of an iron price that remains extremely high. Stausholm again apologised to Rio workers who have been bullied or the victim of racism and sexism in the organisation – deep cultural failings that were laid bare in a report by the former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, released in February. “With the executive team’s commitment, we can make a positive and lasting change and make Rio Tinto a less hierarchical, more humane place to work,” he said. The outgoing chairperson, Simon Thompson, who retired at the end of the shareholder meeting, said that climate change was “the defining issue for our age, and is at the heart of our new strategy”. He said the company had a “critical role” in the transition away from fossil fuels by supplying the copper, lithium, iron ore and aluminium needed to build renewable energy plants. “With our suppliers, I think we do have very significant influence because frankly, they want our money,” he said. “We can, for example, say to Caterpillar and Komatsu that we’re not going to buy diesel trucks beyond 2030.” Thompson said it was much harder to influence scope three emissions – those put out by Rio’s customers. Rio has released modelling on how the steel industry can decarbonise and hopes to have similar work done on the aluminium business, which is a heavy user of electricity, by the time of next year’s AGM. “The reason that we have not set quantifiable targets for scope three is because we cannot control the pace at which our customers, the steel mills, decarbonise their operations,” he said. “If we were to put targets out there, that to me would be close to lying, it would be greenwashing, because we would be setting hard quantifiable targets for something we don’t control.” “Far from rhetoric and lying we are being very transparent, very honest about what we can do and we are setting very ambitious targets.” Stausholm agreed with a questioner who said Rio should already have had in place a workplace culture where people behaved respectfully towards each other. He said Rio management had not previously fully understood what was happening in the organisation. “I think with the kind of things we’ve done … we have a perfect starting point for all of us to take responsibility and build an absolutely terrific future culture,” he said. On Russia, Thompson said Rio would probably benefit if Rusal, its joint venture partner in a alumina refinery at Gladstone, in Queensland, was sanctioned over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rio has taken full control of the company that runs the refinery, Queensland Alumina Ltd, after Australia slapped sanctions on key Rusal shareholders Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg. “If Rusal was to be sanctioned, that would certainly cause pretty significant disruption in the market because Rusal is a very big supplier of aluminium, particularly in Europe,” he said. “I actually think the impact on Rio Tinto would probably be positive in the sense that the aluminium price would likely go up.”",News/Business,Rio Tinto warns Australia’s slow renewable energy rollout threatens fossil fuel phase out,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/rio-tinto-warns-australias-slow-renewable-energy-rollout-threatens-fossil-fuel-phase-out
5/5/2022,"The chunks of rock looked as if they had been splashed with blue and pink paint. I picked one up, ready to be outraged by vandalism, and found that the colours were natural. Even more perplexing, those stones had never seemed so vivid on my previous visits. It was raining and I had not seen the stones so wet before. The water had turned them semi-translucent and the bright inner hues of the rock showed through. The piece in my hand was dark iron-brown with fawn incursions. One side was iced with a thin, whitish layer of rock – this was the substance I had mistaken for paint. Smooth in places, on the folds it bubbled into warty nodules like frozen toad skin. It looked biological, more like a banded nugget of hoof or horn. It was indeed made from animals. In the Cretaceous period, about 100m years ago, this part of Dorset was covered by a warm, shallow sea whirling with tiny creatures. When they died, their bodies dissolved, crystallised and compacted, eventually forming a type of flint called chert. Hardown Hill was renowned for its chert and the hilltop is pitted with old quarries. Bigger lumps, known as cobs were dug out with picks and shovels, and split to give them flat sides suitable for building. Splitting was a dangerous process: chert sparks when struck with steel – it was used for this purpose in flintlock guns – and it fractures into razor shards. The quarrymen wore wire goggles to protect their eyes, and wrapped the cobs in wet sacks before gripping them with a three-clawed iron bar and thumping them with a long-handled hammer. Smaller stones, “hoggin”, were used for road mending, and huge quantities of rock and gravel were removed. Old engravings show the western end of the hill rising to a steep peak that was later quarried out, leaving a cratered hollow. Today the disused workings are overgrown with heath and scrub, a valuable habitat for birds, mammals and a few secretive adders. The first nightjar of the year arrived recently, a female, flipping through the dusk in search of moths, waiting for her mate.

5/5/2022,"The services listed on the billboard outside Rotondaro Costruzioni, an estate agency and builder, are written in Italian and Russian, as are the details of the properties advertised for sale in the window display. Inside, about a dozen thick red folders, filled with plastic envelopes containing details of customers dating back to 2010, spill out of a cabinet. The majority of those property buyers were Russian. A short distance away is a stretch of Italy’s southern Calabrian coastline lapped by clear-blue sea. This is not the glitzy Costa Smeralda in Sardinia or Tuscany’s Forte dei Marmi, where lavish villas and yachts belonging to Russian oligarchs have been seized over the last two months, but Scalea, a low-profile holiday resort with a medieval hilltop village whose economy has flourished over the past decade, partly thanks to the ordinary Russians who flocked here for the cheap property and sunshine. Nicola Rotondaro, the company’s owner, is finalising the sale of another property, a one-bedroom apartment worth €22,000 (£19,000), to a young Russian-Ukrainian man living near Naples. He is not in good spirits, however. The presence of Russian buyers and holidaymakers in Scalea had already all but evaporated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the unauthorised status of the Russian Sputnik vaccine in the EU. Now the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent economic sanctions, especially a ban on flights, means the Russians are unlikely to return for the foreseeable future. “We are already at zero,” said Rotondaro. “The Russians don’t come any more; they’ve been cut off.” Rotondaro is not the only one feeling the pinch. Scalea, a town of just under 11,000 residents, has about 30 property agencies, many catering to the Russian market. Restaurants, bars and shops had come to depend on their Russian guests, who tend to spend more than their Italian counterparts while elongating the holiday season by visiting outside the hot summer months. La Playa, a spacious bar and restaurant, has menus in Russian and Russian-speaking staff, but when the Guardian visited at lunchtime on a recent national holiday, there were few diners. “In normal situations, there are lots of Russians here. Now there is not even one,” said Salvatore, a waiter. “And they spend a lot. If the war ends soon, maybe they’ll return in time for the summer.” Property-building boomed in Scalea, and other towns along Calabria’s coastline, in the 1980s, driven by demand for holiday homes from Italian buyers, mostly from Naples. “You could count the number of foreigners on one hand,” said Tony Hackett, a British-Italian property agent. “But then people who bought during that period stopped coming, and so a lot of property has been recycled.” Interest from Russians started to gather pace from about 2010. They were schoolteachers, professors and doctors, snapping up humble properties that even today can be bought for as little as €14,000. The most famous Russian property owner in Scalea was Boris Klyuyev, an actor who died in 2020. Some of the property owners have settled in the town, including Maria Stepura, the president of the Calabria-Russia association, which helps to promote Calabria in Russia and assists property buyers with Italian bureaucracy. Stepura bought a home close to the beach in 2010. “The value of the rouble at the time meant it cost much less than buying land near Moscow,” she said. Buyers with enough savings would purchase a property outright; others would obtain loans from Russian banks. “Life here is simple: you have a beautiful beach, the cost of living is cheap, you can eat out cheaply and have breakfast at the bar, which is always a pleasure, and the locals are welcoming,” Stepura said. Scalea has been described by the local press as “a little Moscow in Calabria”, but Giacomo Perrotta, the mayor since August 2020, begs to differ. “Yes, there has been significant investment from Russia – obviously Scalea is different from Moscow for those who like the sun,” he said. “But we also have other communities – Polish, Romanian, and Ukrainian. Recently we held a march for peace, and everyone participated, Russians and Ukrainians. As a population, we are well integrated.” The property boom in areas of Calabria was partly fuelled by illegal building by mafia groups, with a crackdown since 2013 leading to the seizure of hundreds of tourist resorts and holiday homes. Some foreign investors became unwittingly entangled in the mafia’s real-estate crimes. Scalea has not been left unscathed, and now the local administration is hoping to put properties confiscated from the mafia on to the market. “We’re participating in a competition for funding, so that is the first step – to have the funds to tidy them up,” said Perrotta. It remains to be seen if Russians will return to buy the additional property stock, but Perrotta is confident that Scalea is in for a busy summer. “We will wait for the Russians to come back … but after two years of the pandemic, we anticipate a boom in tourist presence – we don’t only live off Russians; we have plenty of Italian visitors too.”",News/World news,‘We are already at zero’: Italian resort counts cost as Russian visits dry up,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/italy-holiday-resort-calabria-scalea-russian-property-buyers
5/5/2022,"Greens candidate for Brisbane, Stephen Bates, has taken out an advertisement on Grindr, “the world’s largest social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people”. “You always come first with the Greens,” one reads, and another says: “Spice up Canberra with a third”. Speaking directly to a specific market – in this case, a younger, LGBTQ+ market – could work, according to Dr Andrew Hughes, a political marketing lecturer at the Australian National University who says for any other party it might come across as “tokenistic”. “But the Greens are so strong, and have been for a long time, on LGBTQ and non-binary issues,” he says. “They’ve been really outspoken. So Grindr’s OK.” Hughes is not so convinced by the humour in another Greens advertisement, shared mainly on social media. In it, Tasmanian senator Nick McKim helms a “crisis meeting” to deal with negative media. He’s scruffy-ish, in jeans and a T-shirt, scribbling on a whiteboard while young staffers read out press headlines to him like this one from The Australian: “‘I’ll tax the rich to pay for your teeth,’ Adam Bandt says.” Once the list is written, from a range of critical media articles, it’s a fair summary of Greens’ policies. Fairer welfare, tax the oil and gas corporations, get Medicare to fund dental, and so on. McKim says “that all looks pretty good to me!”. “Maybe leave humour to the comedians and focus on the politics,” Hughes says, although he adds that the ad is on brand. “It was low tech, low budget, it’s consistent with what the Greens are … it’s done on a shoestring. Transparent, ethical, all based on facts and evidence. “Full marks on that. They had a crack.” The Greens rely heavily, but not solely, on targeted social media advertisements. They also run television ads with clever graphics and apocalyptic music to tackle the main parties for taking donations from coal and gas companies. Greens leader, Adam Bandt, appealed for donations for more ads on Wednesday, saying “we need your help to keep these ads running throughout the whole campaign”, pointing to the bigger budgets of other players, such as United Australia Party’s Clive Palmer. Queensland University of Technology researchers wrote this week that online advertising is “more pervasive than its analogue predecessors, it can cost less (per individual ad), be deployed more rapidly, and can be micro-targeted towards specific audiences”.

There’s also a “rogues’ gallery” spending up big in Queensland. The QUT researchers echo Hughes’s comments that Bates’s “tongue-in-cheek” Grindr efforts could only work for certain candidates. “Unlike other sometimes cringe-worthy attempts by politicians to appeal to specific communities, Bates has leaned into his own identity as an openly gay candidate in selecting this platform and developing ads using Grindr’s platform-specific vernacular,” they write. While the polls show Labor ahead of the Coalition just over two weeks out from the election, there is also speculation about a parliament in which the Greens and some of those teal independents hold the balance of power.

5/5/2022,"The Greens and animal welfare groups have called on Labor to commit to a timeline for phasing out live sheep exports, after the opposition said it still intended to ban the trade. Labor told the Alliance for Animals that it will recommit to its policy of phasing out the live sheep export trade, which it announced in 2018 in response to whistleblower videos of a deadly voyage in which 2,400 sheep died. But it has not put a timeline on the proposal, saying only that it will consult with sheep farmers in Western Australia, who are the only group currently selling into the trade, as well as the WA government. “Consistent with scientific advice, Labor will work with industry and the state government to phase out the live sheep export trade,” Labor said in a response to survey questions issued by the Alliance for Animals. “We acknowledge the industry is in decline and we will work with the WA government to support the sector through that contraction, as well as the ongoing growth in chilled lamb exports.” Labor also said it would not scale back the summer ban on live exports, which the Coalition relaxed this year after introducing it in 2019. The Greens spokesperson on animal welfare, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, said the reaffirmed commitment was welcome “after years of silence” from Labor on the issue. “What we need from Labor now is a clear timeline for a ban and a transition plan,” she said. “This can’t just be an empty promise when an election is on.” Faruqi said the Greens would use their position on the crossbench and in the Senate to work with Labor to end the trade. Labor did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia asking for confirmation of the commitment to ban the trade and what timeline they would work toward. The live sheep export trade has declined dramatically, with just 575,000 sheep exported from Australia last year, down from 2 million in 2017. All exports are run through two foreign-owned companies, Livestock Shipping Services and Rural Export & Trading (WA). Alliance for Animals co-director Dr Jed Goodfellow said the further decline in the trade in the last 12 months, with sheep farmers from the WA wheatbelt region able to secure better prices selling to the eastern states of Australia than overseas, showed that the industry could be shut down with minimal impact to farmers. “Many of them have already started their transition to get out of it,” Goodfellow said. “Labor recommitting to this policy is just signing the death knell.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Goodfellow said the Alliance had asked Labor to commit to a three-year phase out, but received no response. The Coalition, in its response to the Alliance’s survey, said it was “committed to upholding the highest standards of animal welfare where it has the authority” and was committed to “influencing” trading partners to achieve good welfare options. It also stressed that animal welfare laws were under the control of state and territory governments. The Coalition does not support a proposal for an independent national animal welfare commission. Labor has committed $4.5m over four years to fund an inspector-general of animal welfare. The Greens also support the proposal for an independent national animal welfare commission.",News/Australia news,Greens and animal welfare groups push for Labor to give timeline for live export ban ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/greens-and-animal-welfare-groups-push-for-labor-to-give-timeline-for-live-export-ban
