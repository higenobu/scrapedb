3/19/2022,"It’s a startling message at first glance. But the note at the counter at Arthur Bryant’s Barbecue is unambiguous: “order anything besides brisket or burnt ends,” it reads in part. Those two cuts account for more than two-thirds of sales at the barbecue institution on Kansas City’s East Side. But increasing beef prices have the restaurant urging customers to try another protein like pork, chicken or turkey. Owner Jerry Rauschelbach says he hates the prices he’s forced to charge customers. What four months ago was a $10.95 brisket sandwich is now $17.95. (Keep in mind the whopping portions at Bryant’s: each sandwich is loaded with three-quarters of a pound of meat.) “I’m embarrassed by our brisket pricing,” he said. “But everybody’s doing it. It’s either that or you close your doors.” The cost of nearly all goods and services has been on the rise in recent months as the nation experiences the highest rate of inflation in 40 years. Rauschelbach says he’s seen the price of most supplies rise by at least 25%. But nothing has stung as badly as the skyrocketing prices of beef, which is generally a higher-priced protein. Longer gestation periods for cattle mean farmers can raise other meats like pork or poultry much quicker. Rising prices are so bad that Rauschelbach thinks consumers need to lay off the beef for a while to ease demand — a tall order this time of year when warmer temperatures will see many people firing up their grills and smokers at home. “We need to send the message that we’re not going to eat brisket, we’re not going to eat beef products,” he said. “And if you don’t eat beef products, prices will plummet immediately. It’s simply a supply and demand issue. “If everybody went to a barbecue place and ordered pork for a week, beef prices would come down real damn quick.” Like many other industries, restaurants have faced turbulent supply chains since the onset of the pandemic. Now, packing houses and other suppliers are facing significant labor shortages while product demand stays strong. The good news is that brisket prices seem to be easing. Ever so slowly. “Hopefully, we’ve seen the height and it’s starting to back off,” said Ryan Barrows, vice president of operations at Joe’s KC. “We’re easing off the recent highs. But we’re not playing the same game, yet alone in the same ballpark, as before the pandemic.” Joe’s has faced skyrocketing prices for many items, but soybean oil and beef have topped the charts. “There’s not one product that comes through our door that hasn’t risen in price in the last year and half,” Barrows said. Meat prices plummeted in the earliest months of the pandemic as restaurants closed their doors and cities implemented stay-at-home orders. But they began spiking in the summer of 2020. That saw wholesale brisket prices top $7 a pound, a staggering amount given how much volume a barbecue restaurant loses from meat shrinkage and trimming. Wholesalers are now selling brisket for $3.60 to $4 a pound locally. That’s still high, considering local restaurants saw brisket price of $2.45 per pound two years ago. “It’s been astronomically high for the last few months and it’s started to come off in the last couple weeks,” said Steve Ingala, director of operations at Mies Family Foods, which supplies meat and other products to local grocery stores and restaurants. While consumers can be price sensitive with many items, in Kansas City they don’t necessarily shy away from the meat when prices soar. “Surprisingly, demand stays fairly strong when that price goes up,” Ingala said. “It’s all driven by demand. People are hungry and as long as they’re buying it at the consumer level, it continues.” And now traditionally lower-priced meats are accelerating in price. Ingala said the per-pound price of fresh chicken breast is now only 30 or 40 cents below the per-pound price of whole briskets. “In a normal market, chicken would be a fraction of brisket,” he said. Already reaching record prices, the costs of eggs and chicken are expected to further spike now that several states have experienced outbreaks of avian flu at chicken farms. But none of this turbulence is new to those with experience in food businesses. “Even when things are normal, these proteins tend to fluctuate back and forth,” Ingala said. “When a couple are really high, one is usually more affordable. They kind of move around like that.”",Business/Kansas City Star,Famed Kansas City barbecue joint tells customers: Don’t buy the brisket or burnt ends,https://news.yahoo.com/famed-kansas-city-barbecue-joint-100000495.html

3/19/2022,"The podcast ""Am I Dating a Serial Killer?"" recounts true stories of romance turned abusive and potentially deadly. In episode 2, Dylan says she went on a first date with a man and later saw his mugshot on a Facebook murder-mystery page. An expert said Dylan got out just in time. Dylan was young, newly single, and ready to go on as many dates as possible when she saw Zach, a 27-year-old with Tom-Cruise looks and an adorable dachshund, on a dating app. She knew she had to swipe right. Years after their first date, which Dylan said she left early out of fear, she saw Zach's mugshot on a murder-mystery Facebook page, which said he was arrested for killing a man outside of his apartment and then shooting rounds from a gun on a highway, injuring at least two. Dylan shared her story on an episode of the Audible and XG Productions podcast ""Am I Dating a Serial Killer?"" Every week, a new guest shares a story from their dating life with host Gabi Conti, and an expert discusses potential underlying psychological motives. Dylan, who omitted her last name and Zach's for privacy reasons, told Conti she believes her young age and low self-esteem factored into her decision to go on the date, which she said ended with Zach following her on the highway and harassing her for two weeks over text message. ""Looking back on this, I definitely see myself as just being naive, so it's not a shock to me that I found myself in kind of an icky situation,"" Dylan said on the episode. Dylan said she and Zach met for a first date on the same day they matched after only a few hours of texting. She said in retrospect, that was the first red flag. She said they bonded over pictures he had with a dachshund, the dog breed she grew up with, and he asked her on a date, saying he'd bring the pooch along. According to Dylan, she didn't ask Zach to bring his dog. He just offered, she said. She was confused, then, when he showed up without a dog. ""So I asked him, of course. And he was like, 'Everybody always just wants to get me for my dog. I don't understand,'"" Dylan said. She added that she found Zach's comment manipulative because moments later, he said that the dog in the photos wasn't his. On the date, Zach kept looking at her in a ""predatory"" way, Dylan said. When he kept persisting she leave with him, Dylan lied, and said she had to leave on her own to meet up with friends. That's when Zach said he'd walk her to her car. Dylan said she agreed out of fear. She didn't want to anger Zach. Once they got to her car, Zach ""planted this massive kiss on me, just stuck his tongue down my throat,"" said Dylan, adding that it left her speechless and terrified. After she pulled away, she said Zach followed her in his car for 10 minutes. For the next two weeks, he texted her, often in the middle of the night, ranting and suggesting she used him for his dog. A few years later, Dylan, a true-crime fan, saw Zach's mugshot on a Facebook murder-mystery fan page called Murderino. The post claimed he'd been arrested for killing a man outside his apartment and shooting a gun on a highway, she said. Dylan also said she saw videos of Zach's arrest on Snapchat, where he appeared to act erratic. On the podcast episode, Jana Monroe, a retired FBI special agent of 22 years who worked on infamous serial killer Ted Bundy's case, weighed in on Dylan's story. According to Monroe, Dylan took proper action when she trusted her intuition and left the date after feeling uneasy. She said giving her phone number to Zach before meeting him first compromised her safety, and cautioned others from doing the same. Monroe said Dylan's characterization of him reminded her of Bundy. If a date is too forceful, or their words and actions don't add up, they could be dangerous, said Monroe. She said Dylan did the right thing when she left after 30 minutes, and suggested all singles share their location with a trusted friend before a date. You could even make up an excuse to check in via text during the date, Monroe said. Most importantly, don't worry about coming off as nice and accommodating if your gut is sending you warning signs, said Monroe. ""If you're on a date with someone and you're getting all of those indicators, that's the time to leave and not be polite. You don't have to get up and cause a scene, but there are ways to extricate yourself, and I think you should at that time,"" Monroe said.
