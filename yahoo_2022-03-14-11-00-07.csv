3/14/2022,"The computer repairman at the center of the Hunter Biden laptop saga is ready to tell his side of the story. In a new interview with the New York Post, John Paul Mac Isaac, who in 2020 alerted the FBI of incriminating emails, text messages, photos and financial documents on Biden’s infamous laptop, before turning it over to Rudy Giuliani, revealed that he’s since lost his store and now faces bankruptcy. “I was getting a lot of death threats,” he explained. “I had to have a Wilmington trooper parked in front of my shop all the time. Mac Issac continued, “There were multiple situations where people came in and you could tell they were not there to have a computer fixed. And if there were not other people in the shop, I don’t know what would have happened. I was having vegetables, eggs, dog shit thrown at the shop every morning.” The former owner of The Mac Shop in Wilmington, Delaware, says that he’s endured harassment from the IRS and other government agencies, citing the difficulties he faced while attempting to file for unemployment last December. “I would open up a case, wouldn’t hear anything, then open another case, then open another case and then I was told to stop opening up cases. And they would keep closing these cases,” he said. As a result, Mac Issac faces bankruptcy, adding that since closing his shop he’s been forced to work several odd jobs. “Bankruptcy looks like my only option,” he said. “A buddy of mine does estate clean outs, manual labor. I helped a neighbor redo their porch and I’m trying to do more with woodworking.” Despite his hardships, Mac Issac has no regrets on ending up at the center of such a controversial story. “If I had the choice to do it again, I would absolutely do it again,” he said. “I was raised since 9/11 to believe if you see something you say something.” Hunter Biden’s Wife Says He Was Unfaithful and Blew Money on Drugs and Prostitutes Hunter Biden Recalls ""Picking Through Rugs"" for Crack in Latest Interview About 'Beautiful Struggles: A Memoir' Joe Biden's Son Was Booted From the Navy for Being Coked Out The Complex SHOP: Designer Clothing and Brands Complex Podcast Network Sole Collector Mobile App - Your app for the Sneaker World Sneaker of the Year: The Best Since ’85 Book - Now available for pre-order!

3/14/2022,"By Ben Blanchard NANSHIPU, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited army reservists training under a new scheme to bolster war readiness on Saturday, a programme that has gotten added impetus from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, given China's bellicosity against the island. The war in Ukraine has stirred debate in Chinese-claimed Taiwan about its own readiness and tactics should Beijing ever make good on threats to take the island by force. Taiwan's government announced late last year a reform of the training of its reserve forces, including doubling down on combat and shooting exercises. Under the new programme which began this month, reservists get two weeks of training, rather than the previous five to seven days, and spend more time on combat training like firing guns. Observing the training at the Nanshipu firing range outside the capital Taipei, Tsai, dressed in full military fatigues including body armour, said reservists were specifically getting trained in areas close to their homes. ""The recent situation in Ukraine once again proves that the protection of the country, in addition to international solidarity and assistance, depends on the unity of the whole people,"" she said, flanked by her top security officials. Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told reporters there were many lessons they could learn from Ukraine, where he said people were being given guns and sent to fight after only a few days of training. ""For our reservists, if they train for between seven and 14 days a year, that gives us a lot more confidence."" Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force. But Reuters has reported the switch was troublesome and has led to a gutting of the 2.31 million-strong reserve force. Some complained of wasting time on pointless drills and lectures during retraining. The new system is being trialed in the first three quarters of this year on about 15,000 reservists and will be reviewed in the fourth quarter to see whether it will continue. Taiwan and Ukraine's armed forces are both undermanned and undergunned compared to their giant neighbours. Tsai has championed the concept of ""asymmetric warfare"" to make the military more mobile, harder to attack and better able to survive and strike back in a war, as Beijing steps up what Taipei views as its threats against the island. Reservists are part of that plan. The Defence Ministry has been heavily promoting the new scheme on its social media channels, showing pictures of reservists carrying out live-fire drills and being greeted by flag-waving children shouting messages of support. Freddy Lim, an independent lawmaker who sits on parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee, told Reuters the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made many Taiwanese more determined to defend the island and has boosted public support for reservist training reform and civil defence. ""In the past, before Ukraine, we were called alarmist when we made these efforts. That's not the case anymore,"" he said. ""Like Ukraine, I believe we have a very strong will to defend our country.""
