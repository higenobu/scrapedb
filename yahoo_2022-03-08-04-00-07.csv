3/8/2022,"Tim Shanley, 32, from Sydney... and I am a product manager in the Superannuation industry
 I got married in late 2019 and was in relatively good shape. After coming back from my honeymoon my wife and I bought our first home together and I was on cloud nine. Then Covid hit in early 2020, and I started to work from home full-time. While I was still on a mental high, I was enjoying myself a little bit too much, and as a result my exercise and fitness regime took a back seat with gyms being closed, and so did my diet. I lost all structure and routine in my life and ended up over-eating, drinking too much alcohol, and pretty much stopped exercising. At my heaviest I tipped the scales at 113 kgs (249 pounds). I had lost all of my confidence, I was not feeling good about myself both mentally and physically, and I was starting to get concerned about my overall health and wellbeing from things such as elevated blood pressure, increased stress, trouble sleeping, and irritability. I was not happy, and was seeking joy artificially from comforts such as alcohol and food. Seeing myself in a photo from a wedding in late 2020 was my lightbulb moment. I didn’t like what I saw: I couldn’t accept the fact I had let myself go so much, and felt embarrassed. I realised I needed to make a change and make a change fast, so I reached out to the professionals to help me pull my finger out! I contacted Ultimate Performance in Sydney in late 2020 with the intention of starting 2021 fresh with a new mindset and with some big goals to get my life back on track. My program consisted of four workouts a week, two with my trainer and two by myself, which were a combination of full body high intensity, resistance training and heavy weight workouts. I also walked between a minimum of 15,000 to 20,000 steps a day every day. My program was 20 weeks long in total, and my target was to get down to 10 percent bodyfat. When I started the program, my thought process and attitude towards my diet completely changed and allowed me to take more accountability for what I was putting into my body and kept me honest. I started to watch what I was eating more closely though understanding macros, meal timing and nutrition. My trainer Saskia believed in me from day one. She gave me the motivation and encouragement needed to achieve my goals and equipped me with the tools to push myself to places I didn’t think I could go. She was very unselfish with her knowledge on health and fitness and was constantly feeding me information about how to train correctly, how to diet and understand nutrition, how to listen to my body and how to be confident and positive! I lost a total of 33 kgs (73 pounds) in 20 weeks and hit 10 percent body fat by the end of the journey which was one of my main goals. It was a long grind, but all worth it in the end and I couldn’t have been happier. The physical results speak for themselves, however it’s the things you can't see that I was more satisfied with, such as regaining my confidence, lowering blood pressure, improving my quality of sleep, and just having overall better and more consistent moods. Now I go to bed happy and wake up happy! You don’t need to have a background in strength training or weights to be able to achieve your health and fitness goals. I think it all comes down to attitude, discipline and commitment – if you have these three things, plus a positive mindset, most of the battle is already won. While the physical elements are tough, they are short lived, whereas the mental battle of sticking to a diet and routine is constant, but if you are able to hit small goals, your overall long term goals will be easier to achieve.

3/8/2022,"The Queen has permanently moved out of Buckingham Palace, according to The Sunday Times. Her Majesty has lived at Windsor Castle since the UK first went into lockdown in March 2020. She doesn't plan to ever return to Buckingham Palace, according to The Times' report. Queen Elizabeth II has permanently moved out of her London residence, Buckingham Palace, according to The Sunday Times. The monarch chose to self-isolate at Windsor Castle, located just outside of London, when the UK first went into lockdown in March 2020. At the time, there was no indication from the palace that it would be a permanent move — but the Queen has remained there ever since. According to The Times' royal editor Roya Nikkhah, Her Majesty has decided to make Windsor her ""forever home"" and will undertake future royal engagements from Windsor Castle instead of Buckingham Palace. ""Windsor is the place she loves. She has her memories with Prince Philip there, she has her ponies there and family nearby. It makes sense,"" royal author Hugo Vickers told The Sunday Times. The relocation may be due to the renovation works that have taken place at Buckingham Palace since 2017, according to the Daily Express' royal correspondent Richard Palmer. Although the monarch originally intended to remain at the palace through the 10-year refurbishment, the pandemic allowed her to reconsider where she felt most comfortable, Palmer reported. The renovations are expected to cost $500 million, according to British Heritage. The palace has served as the royal family's official residence since 1837 and is considered the administrative headquarters of the monarch, according to the royal website. It has 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms, the website added. The London residence is still expected to host a number of events in honor of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee weekend in June, including the Trooping the Colour parade and the BBC Platinum Party at the Palace. Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

3/8/2022,"Ken was brought to the emergency department by his wife, Rebecca, who had concerns that he was forgetting things, slurring his speech and having difficulty with his balance. Rebecca told the triage nurse that these symptoms had been going on intermittently for several months. Because the episodes seemed to be occurring more frequently, she called their family physician, who told them to come to the emergency department (ED). The ED was busy the evening they arrived due to patients with injuries related to falls and car crashes because of snowy and ice weather. It took a couple of hours before Ken was able to get a bed. He told his wife that he was tired of waiting and they could come back another day. She refused to let him leave without being evaluated. Dr. Erika Kube: Is there such a thing as drinking too much water? Several of her friends had told her that they thought he was likely developing dementia, which was upsetting because her father had suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia and she remembered how hard it had been on her mother. When I entered the room, Ken looked annoyed to be there. As I asked him what was going on, I paid close attention to how he spoke. I didn't notice any deficits in his speech as he told me that the only reason he was there was because his wife wanted to have him checked out. His wife quickly chimed in that she spoke with his doctor's office about his symptoms and they were concerned enough to send him to the ED. Dr. Erika Kube: Respiratory disease RSV in kids — what are symptoms, why it's rising Over the past several months, Rebecca had noticed that Ken had periods where something seemed off. He appeared confused and had trouble talking at times. She also noticed that he was occasionally off balance while walking and had to hold onto the wall or a chair to keep from falling. These symptoms always seemed to go away, and Ken brushed it off as nothing. Rebecca thought he was developing dementia. I did a detailed neurological exam to see if I could elicit any abnormalities in Ken. He seemed just slightly delayed in answering some questions, but everything else was normal. Rebecca joked that he, of course, didn’t have all the symptoms he had been having while he was in the ED. I asked Ken about his medical history as I simultaneously reviewed his chart and noticed he didn’t have any major medical problems. He said his doctor always gave him a clean bill of health. I asked the nurse to get blood and urine from Ken, and I ordered a CT scan of his brain. I wondered if Rebecca’s concerns about Ken possibly having dementia were right. Dr. Erika Kube: Testicle pain embarrassing to talk about but shouldn't be ignored I was surprised to receive a phone call from the radiologist about an hour later with a critical result. He told me there were numerous masses throughout Ken’s brain consistent with metastatic cancer. He asked if Ken had any history of cancer, which he did not. I took a minute to gather my thoughts before I told Ken and Rebecca what was going on. When I walked in the room Rebecca must have sensed something was wrong as she immediately put her book down, sat straight up and held Ken’s hand. I pulled up Ken’s CT scan images so that I could show them the abnormalities. Ken didn’t say much when I told him that it looked like he had cancer somewhere in his body that had spread to his brain, which had been causing his symptoms over the past few months. He looked at the computer screen with a blank stare. Rebecca was understandably shaken and upset. She kept asking how this was possible since Ken had always been so healthy. I felt so sad for them both as I tried to comfort them. I explained that Ken would need to undergo further evaluation to determine where the cancer had spread from, which would then determine what treatments could be considered for him. Dr. Erika Kube: Did woman's twisted ankle spur rare chronic pain condition? He underwent further imaging that unfortunately found that his primary cancer was in his lung and an MRI of his brain confirmed that he had numerous metastatic lesions. Metastatic spread of the cancer means that cancer cells separate from the primary tumor and travel through the blood stream or lymph system to other parts of the body. Ken was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer, which is the most common type, accounting for approximately 85% of lung cancers. While there are numerous factors that affect survival, in general, the life expectancy after a diagnosis of metastatic brain cancer from the lung is typically poor. Ken met with an oncologist, who advised him that there was not a curative treatment available, but there were several treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy available to him with the goal of helping him to live longer and feel better despite the cancer. Making a diagnosis of cancer in Ken was not what he or I were expecting when he came to the ED that cold winter evening. I was grateful that Ken had not waited any longer to be evaluated and that he had an answer to what was wrong with him. I hoped he would do well with chemotherapy and be able to enjoy his life and time with Rebecca in the coming months.

 NBC News anchor and host of the ""Today"" show Savannah Guthrie on Monday pressed former Attorney General William Barr why he decided, in his 2020 resignation letter, to include positive remarks about former President Trump, who he has called ""dangerous"" to the country in a new book. ""You say in your book you were worried about the peaceful transition of power. You even had national security concerns,"" Guthrie said to Barr during his first live television interview since leaving Trump's administration. ""None of this is present in this resignation letter. Didn't the American people deserve to know what you knew?"" Barr responded by saying he tendered his resignation on Dec. 14, a date by which the 2020 election was already ""over for all intents and purposes."" In the weeks following the election, Trump and his allies repeatedly floated unproven theories of widespread voter fraud, assertions Barr writes in his forthcoming book he told the president were ""bullshit."" ""The idea that something could be done later on Jan. 6 was nonsense,"" Barr told Guthrie. ""Once the election was locked in on Dec. 14, I tendered my resignation and I knew Trump was going to be leaving office."" As part of his efforts to promote the book, Barr last week granted an extensive sit-down interview with NBC's Lester Holt, during which he suggested Trump was responsible for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and shot down the former president's continued claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In a letter responding to a request for comment on Barr's remarks from NBC News over the weekend, Trump said his former attorney general is ""groveling for the media, hoping to gain acceptance that he doesn't deserve."" Guthrie asked Barr about Trump's response, saying critics might suggest the former attorney general is on ""an image rehab tour with a lawyerly flair."" ""People who know me know I don't care much about what people think of me,"" Barr responded. ""I think that's one of the reasons I was persuaded to take the attorney general job because I wasn't looking for anything. I don't have a future career. I'm retired and I felt I could just call them as I see them."" Trump has himself clashed with Guthrie in the past. She pressed him just weeks before the 2020 election about his statements on social media spreading conspiracy theories. ""I don't get that. You're the president,"" Guthrie said to Trump.

3/8/2022,"By Elizabeth Piper and Andrew MacAskill LONDON (Reuters) - Britain set out ways it would crack down on ""dirty money"" on Monday, introducing new legislation to ""hobble"" Russian President Vladimir Putin by making it more difficult for those close to him to use London as their playground. The much-delayed Economic Crime Bill comes as lawmakers from across the political spectrum call on the government to do more to stop the flow of Russian cash into London, dubbed by some as ""Londongrad"", in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. But while anti-corruption campaigners said some of the measures to try to force property owners to reveal their identities and strengthen unexplained wealth orders, they said without new funding, law enforcement agencies would struggle. The new law shows the government is ""determined to root out the dirty money in our economy, and importantly, to hobble Putin and his cronies,"" interior minister Priti Patel told parliament. Duncan Hames, Transparency International UK's director of policy, said the most significant step was a new register requiring anonymous foreign owners of British property to reveal their identities to stop some from hiding behind shell firms. ""It is a seismic change it will bring into the open ownership of companies that are registered elsewhere in the world, and in that respect, it is really ambitious and ground-breaking, but as with all these things it is not enough to write good rules, you have to commit to enforcing them,"" he said. London has long been a top destination for Russian money and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to crack down on those using the capital as a luxury playground, enjoying upmarket hotels and educating their children at fee-paying schools. But Johnson has come under fire for being slow to impose sanctions and asset freezes on Russia oligarchs and those close to Putin's administration after the invasion of Ukraine. HIDDEN WEALTH The main opposition Labour Party suggest the governing Conservative Party might be in thrall of Russian donors, receiving around 1.9 million pounds from them since Johnson took power. Conservative officials say the party does due diligence on all donations and only accepts those from British citizens. The government denies that there is any delay in imposing sanctions but says it needs to make sure it has solid legal cases to support them after criticism that it was taking too long to target people with links to Putin. Italian police have seized villas in its most prestigious locations such as Lake Como and yachts worth 143 million euros from five high-profile Russians, while France has seized a yacht belonging to Rosneft boss Igor Sechin. Transparency International said 1.5 billion pounds-worth of property had been bought by Russians accused of corruption or links to the Kremlin. Some 830 million pounds-worth of this total is owned via offshore companies. The new law will introduce the Register of Overseas Entities but will give anonymous foreign owners of property six months to reveal their real identities - a measure the opposition Labour Party gave them too much time to move assets elsewhere. Some lawmakers called on the government to go further, asking ministers to allow the seizure of British assets from those oligarchs suspected of having links to Putin even before the authorities had imposed sanctions. It was unlikely the government would go so far.

3/8/2022,"Russian oligarchs, who are collectively estimated to control as much as one third of Russia’s wealth, most of which is held outside of Russia in various ways such as shadowy bank accounts and real estate, are feeling the wrath of sanctions by the European Union (EU) and the U.S. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the West swiftly moved to punish the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin by freezing Russian assets, cutting off some of the country’s banks from the SWIFT messaging system, and other measures. Various prominent companies also distanced themselves from Russia. The U.S. and its allies have specifically targeted more than 50 high-profile individuals with ties to Putin’s inner circle, as well as Putin himself. Furthermore, the moves by the West are going as far as actually seizing property owned by these individuals. In his State of the Union address on March 1, President Biden addressed the oligarchs directly: “We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets.” The U.S. has not yet seized any property of sanctioned individuals but has joined in Europeans in efforts to cut off assets. Yachts are a notable asset: According to Superyacht Group, between 7-10% of superyachts worldwide are owned by Russian citizens. On March 4, Italian authorities seized a yacht owned by Alexey Mordashov, chairman of Russian steel and mining company Severstal. On March 2, French customs officials impounded the superyacht of Igor Sechin, CEO of oil giant Rosneft. According to Bloomberg, the yacht was confiscated “as it was preparing an urgent departure.” The 512-foot yacht of Russian billionaire Alisher Umanov — one of the largest in the world and valued around $600-$735 million is being monitored closely in Germany. (Forbes initially reported that the yacht was seized but later issued a correction.) The White House announced new sanctions on Umanov on March 3, with the U.S. Treasury stating that ""any transactions related to the yacht or aircraft, including things such as maintenance, the hiring of operating personnel, or payment of docking or landing fees, conducted with U.S. persons or in U.S. dollars, are prohibited."" (The U.S. sanctions also apply to Umanov's private jet, reportedly one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft.) Russian oligarch-linked yachts, as detailed by news reports and the Yacht Watch project by former CIA officer Alex Finley (paywalled), include a $100 million yacht linked to Putin. Putin's new worth is unclear, though some experts argue that he may be the wealthiest man despite the Kremlin claiming that he earns just an annual salary of $140,000 and only controls moderate assets such as an apartment in Moscow and three cars. In any case, while it's unclear how these seizures will play out over time, the unprecedented moves indicate that the yachts of Russian oligarchs are no longer able to sail across the world without scrutiny.

3/8/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Carlos Barria LVIV/IRPIN, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainian officials said a bread factory had been hit by a Russian air strike on Monday as the country's negotiators assembled for talks with Russian officials after previous rounds that brought no respite in the conflict. The bodies of at least 13 civilians were recovered from rubble after factory in the town of Makariv in the Kyiv region was hit, local emergency services said. Five people were rescued of the 30 believed to have been there at the time. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the reported attack. Russia earlier offered Ukrainians escape routes to Russia and its close ally Belarus on Monday after weekend evacuation ceasefire attempts failed. In the besieged southern port city of Mariupol hundreds of thousands of people remained trapped without food and water under regular bombardments. A Ukrainian negotiator urged Russia to stop its assault on Ukraine, which the United Nations said had sent 1.7 million people fleeing to Central Europe. ""In a few minutes, we will start talking to representatives of a country that seriously believes large-scale violence against civilians is an argument,"" Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. ""Prove that this is not the case."" Under the Russian offer, a corridor from the capital Kyiv would lead to Russia's ally Belarus, while civilians from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city, would be directed to Russia, according to maps published by the RIA news agency. ""Attempts by the Ukrainian side to deceive Russia and the whole civilised world...are useless this time,"" the Russian defence ministry said after announcing the ""humanitarian corridors"". A spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Russian proposal was ""completely immoral"". ""They are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said. A day earlier, Reuters journalists had witnessed people trying to flee the town of Irpin near Kyiv getting caught in Russian shelling. On Monday people picked their way over the twisted ruins of a large bridge in Irpin, with river water rushing just beneath them. ""It's like a disaster. The city is almost ruined and the district where I'm living (there are) no houses which were not bombed,"" a young woman leaving with her children told Reuters. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians. It calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and remove leaders it describes as neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a transparent pretext for an invasion to conquer a nation of 44 million people. OIL BAN MULLED Western nations have placed heavy sanctions on Moscow to isolate it from global commerce and are now considering banning Russian oil imports. Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008 amid the prospect of less supply from Russia, the world's biggest exporter of oil and gas. International businesses and sports bodies have suspended ties, and wider economic disruption is likely as Russia and Ukraine are both among the world's main exporters of food and industrial metals. Prices of nickel, which is used to make stainless steel and batteries for electric vehicles, surged about 60% on Monday and have now nearly doubled since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Russian forces were ""beginning to accumulate resources for the storming of Kyiv"", a city of more than 3 million, after days of slow progress in their main advance south from Belarus. Ukraine said 2,000 civilians had been evacuated from Irpin, where Reuters journalists on Sunday saw people running for their lives and diving for cover as explosions burst and flames shot up into the sky. Panting with exhaustion and shock, they were helped onto busses by Ukrainian troops. In Mariupol, deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said there had also been continuous air raids overnight. Orlov told CNN authorities were ready to evacuate 6,000 people on Saturday but the Russians had bombed 29 big municipal buses that were to transport them. Moscow has accused the Ukrainians of blocking the planned evacuations. Ukraine said on Monday its forces had retaken control of the town of Chuhuiv in the northeast, site of heavy fighting for days, and of the strategic Mykolayiv airport in the south, which the regional governor said was under tank fire. Neither claim could immediately be verified. The United Nations called for safe passage to reach people cut off from lifesaving aid across Ukraine. In a humanitarian update it described one psychiatric hospital 60 km (40 miles)from Kyiv running out of water and medicine with 670 people trapped inside, including bedridden patients with severe needs. The World Health Organization said at least six people had been confirmed killed in nine attacks on health care facilitaties since the start of the war. PICK UP PACE Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters Moscow would halt operations if Ukraine ceased fighting, amended its constitution to declare neutrality, and recognised Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of regions held by Russian-backed separatists. Ed Arnold, an analyst with Britain's Royal United Services Institute said Russia would need to try to consolidate the gains it has already made and pause to mobilise more forces unless the pace of its assault picked up. ""At the current rate of Russian losses ... we do have indications that this operation would be unsustainable within about three weeks,"" he said. While Russia's advance in the north on Kyiv has been stalled for days with an armoured column stretching for miles along a highway, it has made more progress in the south, pushing east and west along the Black and Azov Sea coasts. Moscow has acknowledged nearly 500 deaths among its soldiers, but Western countries say the true number is much higher and Ukraine says it is many thousands. Death tolls cannot be verified, but footage widely filmed across Ukraine shows burnt-out wreckage of Russian tanks and armour, and parts of Ukrainian cities reduced to rubble by Russian strikes.
