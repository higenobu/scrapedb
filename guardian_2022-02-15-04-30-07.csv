2/15/2022,"A hacker who leaked the names and locations of more than 90,000 people who donated money to the Canadian trucker convoy protest has said it exposed how money from abroad had funded “extremism” in the country. In an exclusive interview, the hacker told the Guardian that Canada was “not safe from foreign political manipulation”.  “You see a huge amount of money that isn’t even coming from Canada – that’s plain as day,” said the hacker, who belongs to the hacktivist group Anonymous. The leaked data showed more than 90,000 donations were made via GiveSendGo, with most funds appearing to come from Canada and the US. According to the data, individuals in other countries including the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark also donated. Amarnath Amarasingam, a professor at Canada’s Queens University and an expert in extremism and social movements, tweeted that of the 92,844 donations, “51,666 (56%) came from the US, 36,202 (29%) came from Canada, and 1,831 (2%) came from the UK.” US-based donors sent US$3.62m, while Canadians donated US$4.31m, he added. The hacker said the sizeable number of donations coming from Canada showed that some people in the country had a lot in common with what they saw as American-style extremism. “Up here in Canada we kind of lied to ourselves,” the hacker said. “[We were saying] ‘it couldn’t happen here, there’s no way it could happen, we are better.’ And now people are kind of faced with the reality that no, actually, we have much more in common with our neighbours to the south than we wanted to admit to ourselves.” The data shows that about a dozen donors used .gov email addresses in association with donations, indicating that some money came from government employees in the US. These included accounts from the US Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Nasa, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and a state transit corporation. The data also contained one Canadian government email address. When asked what the leak meant to the public, the hacker said: “If you are doing some fascism and domestic extremism kinds of movements … [then] you are not going to have a good time because hacktivists have been focusing more and more and more on countering domestic extremism, because we are fucking pissed.” On Sunday, GiveSendGo’s web domain was redirected to a page featuring a video clip of the animated film Frozen with a message to convoy supporters. “Attention GiveSendGo grifters and hatriots,” it read, “You helped fund the January 6th insurrection in the US, you helped fund an insurrection in Ottawa. In fact, you are committed to funding anything that keeps the raging fire of misinformation going until that [sic] it burns the world’s collective democracies down.” It added: “On behalf of sane people worldwide who wish to continue living in a democracy, I am now telling you that GiveSendGo itself is frozen.” GiveSendGo became the main site for donations after another crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, blocked money transfers. On Monday, although the hacker’s message no longer appeared on the landing page of GiveSendGo, the site remained down.",News/World news,"Foreign money funding extremism in Canada, says hacker",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/foreign-money-funding-extremism-in-canada-says-hacker
2/15/2022,"Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is the latest western leader to arrive in Moscow – and he may be the last before Russian troops cross into Ukrainian territory. Mr Scholz’s immediate task on Tuesday will be to make clear the high price that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, will pay if he decides to turn a war of nerves into a war. Given that Germany has been seen as being a European power with the closest economic ties with Russia – notably via the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline – his words ought to carry some weight in the Kremlin. Mr Putin may not care, but he should. The US’s megaphone diplomacy has seen Washington present a public case for a real and present danger – even naming the date of a possible Russian offensive this week – that narrowed the gap between western allies on the level of Russian sanctions which could successfully deter an invasion. Russia’s hybrid war strategy is based on sowing confusion and disinformation. The US, by revealing intelligence in real time, has put Russia on the defensive, preventing it from using such tactics to shroud its moves.  There are 130,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders. It is possible that Mr Putin is bluffing; the west’s warnings may make it harder for him to retreat without appearing humiliated. That might be a better problem for the world to have than the US projection that Russian forces could overwhelm Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, within two days, leaving as many as 50,000 civilians dead or wounded. Mr Putin helped create the current Ukrainian internal chaos. It was his bloody invasion and annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014 that turned the anger behind the protests in Kyiv against corruption, brutality and oligarchical rule into a much harder anti-Russian feeling in Ukraine. Today that is not anti-Russian so much as anti-Putin sentiment. The Russian president’s waning influence in Kyiv has largely been a problem of his own making. Russia’s actions have also lent credibility to the idea it is a rogue state. Diplomacy should be a way of reaching a destination that all parties can live with. It’s hard to see what safe haven that might be in the short term for Ukraine and Russia. Mr Putin would probably want a Ukrainian regime in power that is, if not pliant, at least friendly to Russia. But that is a faraway prospect without giving up control of the Ukrainian provinces currently in Russian hands. Ukrainians will not stand, quite reasonably, for their territory to become formalised as a cat’s paw for Moscow. Nato is no real threat to Mr Putin’s supremacy inside Russia and neither is a functioning democracy on Russia’s border. As his military creeps towards the Ukrainian border, talks are still the best way of exploring what he may accept. He could be president until at least 2036. All this makes it important for western leaders to engage with Moscow. Russia is unlikely to ever get a cast-iron commitment that Ukraine will never join Nato, but it might get assurances behind closed doors that that won’t happen any time soon. Mr Putin could be offered talks over wider Russian concerns. It was encouraging that on Monday, when the Russian president asked his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, about the likelihood of a deal with the west over Ukraine and Nato, he replied: “There’s always a chance.” At present, what Moscow will do and how the west will respond are unknowns. But there are things that should be said publicly to reassure allies, and others that should be said privately to calm – and deter – adversaries.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on megaphone diplomacy: countering Russian disinformation | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/14/the-guardian-view-on-megaphone-diplomacy-countering-russian-disinformation
2/15/2022,"The average Afghan was not even alive when planes were flown into the twin towers on 11 September 2001. This is only one of the reasons why handing money from the Afghan central bank to the families of 9/11 victims would be unconscionable. Parents are already selling their organs to feed their children, 98% of the population is short of food, and unless cash starts flowing again things are about to get much, much worse. The executive order signed by the Biden administration on Friday would allow Afghanistan’s $7bn US-held assets, frozen when the Taliban swept to power, to be halved. One half would be held pending the outcome of lawsuits brought against the Taliban by the families of 9/11 victims who have persuaded a judge to attach their case to the Afghan assets. The other half, if courts agree, would be used for humanitarian aid. The administration’s argument is that this may help get assistance to Afghanistan more swiftly, without having to await the outcome of the cases. The government can step into lawsuits to say what it believes is in the national interest, but decided that it would not object to any decision to award half the money to the families.  Though central bank funds are supposed to enjoy diplomatic immunities, it appears that the administration can act if a “recognised representative of the Afghan government” approves – raising obvious questions about who might now qualify. Whatever the legal technicalities, the moral case is clear. Afghans are not to blame for 9/11, though they have paid for it many times over. Some of the bereaved have already condemned the idea of taking Afghan money as a betrayal. Thousands of American families were devastated that day, and $7bn compensation was disbursed to bereaved relatives and the injured (many of whom faced huge medical bills); another $10bn is still being paid out. This is in stark contrast with Afghanistan, where, on the very rare occasions that the US made compensation or “condolence” payments for civilian deaths, relatives usually received a small four-figure sum. The administration cannot claim the moral high ground because it proposes using some of the money for aid. Though most of it originally came from international donors, including the US, it is no longer theirs to spend, and some represents the personal savings of Afghans. In any case, humanitarian relief is no substitute for a functioning, if floundering, economy. It is not merely that it raises the prospect of starving Afghans paying the salaries of western aid workers, and of a flood of food aid causing more long-term damage by crippling agriculture. The UN had already warned that the financial system could collapse within months; seizing the central bank’s assets could be the last straw. It’s true that those funds alone can’t solve Afghanistan’s underlying problems – but they are desperately needed to stave off some of the worst consequences. Afghan experts and others have worked on imaginative solutions to restore liquidity without simply ceding control of assets to the Taliban. The problem is not a lack of means, but of will: relief is an easier political sell in the US, which is also believed to have blocked other countries from unfreezing funds. No one wants to aid the Taliban, whose primary victims are Afghans. But no one should claim the administration’s plan is in the best interests of the Afghan people.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on a Kabul heist: snatching money from the starving | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/14/the-guardian-view-on-a-kabul-heist-snatching-money-from-the-starving
2/15/2022,"To paraphrase Mario Balotelli, why is it always them? Was it not enough that Russia corrupted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi with a devilish scheme that involved Federal Security Service agents passing steroid-riddled urine samples through a mouse hole before swapping them with clean urine? The act was so devious that the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, later called it “a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games”.  Was it not enough that, as the esteemed law professor Richard McLaren found in 2016, the Russian government, security services and sporting authorities colluded to hide doping across more than 1,000 athletes in more than 30 sports – a practice that became state policy after the country’s poor performance at the 2010 Winter Games? Even as late as 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency found Russia had manipulated data from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory to stop investigators banning more of its athletes. That is the reason why Russia is competing under the banner of the Russian Olympic Committee in Beijing, and their anthem is banned. And now, the greatest tragedy of all. A 15-year-old girl, already perhaps the greatest female skater in history, caught in a complicated mess, as the world’s media pick over the bones of her positive doping test. It is a tragedy because it is impossible to imagine Kamila Valieva ordering a banned drug off the internet, finding it in a family medicine cabinet, or whatever the explanation might be, and – on a whim – taking it. If trimetazidine was in her system someone must have passed it on, perhaps telling her it was for recovery, be it an individual, entourage, or even a state. And it is a tragedy, because to see Valieva up close is to marvel at one of the finest athletes in global sport. Twice in the past week I have had a rinkside seat, with perhaps just 30 or 40 others, while she has practised: the equivalent of seeing Lady Gaga playing an intimate pub gig. Time and again she has made the impossible look effortless: triple axels, triple toe loops, triple lutzes, even the famed quad. In a different system perhaps she would have time to etch her greatness with an indelible marker. Instead, with a doping ban still looming, Tuesday and Thursday might be the last times she skates at a Winter Olympics. That is why, for all the condemnation of the court of arbitration for sport’s decision on Monday, it didn’t feel entirely unfair for it to allow her compete again despite her positive test. At least this way she gets more time to fight her case and for the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate those around her. And, if a doping ban does come months down the line, at least it will avoid a public shaming in front of the eyes of hundreds of millions of people. Although other skaters denied the chance to stand on the podium would vehemently disagree. To many, the Valieva case has arisen due to an extraordinary set of circumstances across 44 days. On 25 December Valieva gave a drugs test at the Russian figure skating championships. Yet it was only on 8 February, a day after the 15-year-old inspired her country to gold in the team skating, that she learned she had tested positive. The reason for the delay? A Covid outbreak among workers at a doping laboratory in Sweden. However, this is not a 44-day problem but one stretching over at least six or seven years, from the moment the full extent of Russia’s doping problem started to seep out. Not so long ago, the broken windows theory became popular among politicians. The idea is simple: if you allow damage in a community to linger, it only promotes more crime and disorder. Therefore problems should be eradicated immediately. This, to put it mildly, has not been an approach taken by global sport leaders. At every turn they have talked tough on Russia while applying a homeopathic approach and diluting potential punishments. Perhaps it was necessarily realpolitik. Perhaps it was the only strategy to ensure innocent athletes weren’t wrongly caught up in the crimes and punishment of the broader state. But it has looked painfully weak: the equivalent of a parent punishing a child who attempts to burn down a house by wagging a finger and telling them to stand on the naughty step. But without real incentives to reform – or a fear they could be truly kicked out of international sport – how will Russia ever truly change? However when it comes to the abuse of young athletes, it is not just Russia, and it is not only doping. In the US and Britain, we have heard horrific tales of sexual and physical abuse, particularly in gymnastics, where girls are required to train as elite athletes from a young age. As one leading British coach put it to me, it is all too easy for young kids to become vessels for coaches, federations and even states. “Doping is a symptom,” he added. “The disease is the early specialisation of children. It never gets talked about, and the whole situation is tragic.” Given Valieva’s age, she is classified by Wada as a protected athlete. But how protected is she really from the pressures of an Olympic Games, or the demands of her country and coach? Perhaps it is time to ask whether 13, 14 or 15 year olds really should be competing at a summer or winter Games. As Global Athlete, a union that represents thousands of athletes, put it on Monday, Valieva’s positive doping test appears clear evidence of abuse of a minor. “Sport should be protecting its athletes, not damaging them,” it said. It is hard to argue with that. But in this case words are cheap. Valieva is but a pawn here. And if she ends up tarred and condemned, while a bigger kingpin escapes censure, it would be an affront to natural justice.",Sport/Sport,Valieva caught in a complicated mess that has been coming for years | Sean Ingle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/14/valieva-caught-in-a-complicated-mess-that-has-been-coming-for-years
2/15/2022,"The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has left financial markets jittery but not yet panicky. Unsurprisingly, shares took a tumble on the world’s bourses and there was a brief rise in oil prices to just over $96 a barrel. Investors were taking few chances and sought out traditional safe havens such as the US dollar, but there was little sense that world war three was about to break out. If anything, financial markets seem to be underestimating the risks.  War in eastern Europe would deliver a double blow: affecting consumer and business confidence, while at the same time giving an added twist to already strong inflationary pressures. The fear is that Putin would respond to western sanctions by deploying economic weapons of his own. That looks a reasonable assumption. Russia provides the EU with 40% of its oil products and coal, and a fifth of its natural gas. It is the world’s biggest exporter of fertilisers and the palladium used by the auto industry in catalytic converters. So, while it is the case that Russia is a big landmass with a tiny economy (its GDP is smaller than Italy’s, for example) it can have an impact disproportionate to its size. Indeed, the impact of the tension between Moscow and Kyiv is already being felt by motorists in the UK. Petrol prices are already at a record high and forecast to go higher. Those who remain relatively relaxed say events in Ukraine will have a much smaller impact on markets than the fading of the Covid threat, supply-side bottlenecks and the interest rate decisions made by the Federal Reserve. Even if they are right, though, it is clear that supply-side problems and inflationary pressure would be worsened by military conflict in Ukraine. In theory, an increase in the cost of living caused by a one-off event is exactly the sort of supply shock that central banks tend to “look through” – that is, do nothing about in the belief that they will have no lasting effects. But Simon MacAdam of Capital Economics says a Russian invasion or a ratcheting-up of sanctions could add as much as two percentage points to inflation in the west. Would the Bank of England – already forecasting inflation of more than 7% this spring – really turn a blind eye if instead it was nudging 10%? It hardly seems likely. By international standards, Britain has a long-hours culture. The average working week is almost 42 hours, and 12% of people work more than 50 hours. Other countries put in fewer weekly hours but get more out of their employees when they are in the workplace. So, for many years there has been a campaign to shorten the working week to four days without loss of pay on the grounds that workers will be more committed to their jobs and hence more productive. The basic argument is that employers will get as much out of happy workers in four days as they would out of unhappy workers in five, and their wellbeing will improve. The pandemic has brought a sharper focus to the debate, with a boom in working from home and hybrid working. Now the Welsh government is being urged by its future generations commissioner, Sophie Howe, to launch a four-day-week trial in parts of the public sector. This might be the worst time to test out the idea, given that vacancies are at record levels and money is tight. NHS administrators will rightly ask what the implications may be for waiting lists. Schools will want to know whether they will have to hire more supply teachers. In fact, this is the best time for a trial, because it means the idea will be examined on a small scale under the toughest conditions. Wales should go for it. Just over 100 MPs were asked to answer a simple probability question by the Royal Statistical Society: the chances of heads coming up both times when a coin is tossed twice. Given that they are ultimately responsible for spending more than £1tn of taxpayers’ money, the result was not altogether reassuring. Only 52% of lawmakers were able to come up with the right answer, 25%.",News/World news,"Ukraine crisis has financial markets spooked, but not yet despondent | Larry Elliott",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/14/ukraine-crisis-has-financial-markets-spooked-but-not-yet-despondent
2/15/2022,"Cressida Dick was ousted by London’s mayor to deflect from his own failings, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation has said. Ken Marsh, who leads the body representing rank-and-file officers in Britain’s largest force, claimed his members had “no faith” in Sadiq Khan, and needed to support any changes otherwise they would not work. He insisted the Metropolitan police commissioner had been reforming the force’s culture before she was pushed out.  His attack comes as government sources insist they believe “radical change” is needed in the Met, the same view held by Khan. The home secretary, Priti Patel, and Khan are expected this week to discuss the attributes they want to see in the next commissioner. A government source denied claims the London mayor would be excluded from the selection process, pointing out it was mandated by law. In his attack, Marsh said Met morale was at rock bottom after Dick quit last week. It came after Khan told her her plans for ridding the Met of racism, misogyny and boosting flagging public confidence were not good enough. Marsh said: “We’ve got to put some context on what we are talking about. The incidents that have taken place are horrific. We do not want these individuals in the job. “But the federation will continue to speak up for our good officers. We totally accept that we have to deliver for the public and work to improve confidence, but if you haven’t got your workforce with you then you are not going to achieve what you’re setting out to achieve. “Frankly, what we are viewing is politicians trying to use policing and the career of the country’s most senior police leader to deflect from their own failings.” Chris Excell, the chair of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said the next commissioner had to accept the force was still plagued by institutional racism. “New leadership must be willing to fully acknowledge the importance of the task ahead and produce a plan of action that guards against deflection or non-acceptance of institutional racism,” Excell said. A Home Office source said despite press reports over the weekend, the Conservative home secretary and the Labour mayor were in broad agreement. “Both of them believe there needs to be radical change in the Met. The need for radical change is evident for all to see,” they said. A spokesperson for the mayor hit back at the Marsh warning, downplaying the idea that the crisis would hamper efforts to rebuild public trust. “It was the mayor’s view that a change of leadership was the only way to address this crisis in trust,” they said. “The mayor has always made clear that there are thousands of incredibly brave and decent police officers at the Met who we owe a huge debt of gratitude. But the series of scandals seen in recent years has tarnished the reputation of the police, which is so crucial to policing by consent. “Downplaying the scale of the change required is only going to hinder, not help, the vital process of restoring Londoners’ trust in the Met.” Talks continue about how long Dick will remain as commissioner and whether she will get any pay out. She had been granted a two-year contract extension due to start in April. She took an annual salary of £230,000 but was entitled to £40,000 a year more. Government and City Hall sources insist the search for her replacement will be genuinely open and there are no favourites in mind.",News/UK news,"Khan ousted Cressida Dick to ‘deflect from his own failings’, says police union",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/khan-ousted-cressida-dick-deflect-from-his-own-failings-says-metropolitan-police-federation-chair
2/15/2022,"A senior Metropolitan police commander who wrote his force’s current drug strategy faces the sack after being accused of taking cannabis, LSD and magic mushrooms. Commander Julian Bennett – who oversaw the dismissal of two officers for drug misuse – took the drugs while on holiday in France, a gross misconduct hearing has been told.  The police officer – who has been suspended on full pay since July 2021, pending an investigation by the Met’s directorate of professional standards – allegedly took the drugs on holiday between February 2019 and July 2020. He is accused of refusing to provide a drug sample on 21 July 2020. After being informed on that occasion that there was reasonable cause to suspect that he had used cannabis, he allegedly claimed he had taken CBD (cannabidiol) for a medical condition with his face as a reason for refusing. A photograph sent on WhatsApp showing cannabis on a table had been submitted as evidence, the hearing in London was told. The hearing, which had been listed to take place over the course of this week, was adjourned until 23 May this year after lawyers for Bennett argued that it would not be “fair” to proceed because they had not received all the WhatsApp messages, emails and SMSs they wanted, including a year’s worth from one witness. John Beggs, defending Bennett, said: “Although we are all committed to getting this hearing on the way in the public interest, in the interest of the Metropolitan police service and in the interest of Mr Bennett, fairness must trump disposition.” Beggs said the witness may have “cherry-picked” the messages that had been disclosed. Mark Ley-Morgan QC, representing the police, said they had disclosed all relevant material. Bennett, who faces dismissal from the force for gross misconduct over the alleged drug use, wrote the MPS drug strategy for 2017-21 as a commander for territorial policing. The document, titled “Dealing with the impact of drugs on communities”, set out plans to “raise awareness of the dangers of drug misuse”. Bennett also presided over 74 misconduct hearings, involving 90 officers, between June 2010 and February 2012, according to a freedom of information request lodged in 2021. Out of these hearings,, 56 officers were dismissed – more than 75%. A further FoI request in 2020 found that Bennett chaired 69 of the hearings during the time period and that two officers were dismissed for drugs misuse. When he was suspended, Bennett was a lead for the Met on criminal justice – an area that includes managing prosecutions and pandemic planning. He joined the force in 1977 and has served in a range of high-profile roles including operations to tackle moped gangs in London and planning for the 2012 London Olympics. He also chaired the panel that sacked PC Simon Harwood, the Met police officer who struck and pushed Ian Tomlinson as he walked away from riot officers on the fringe of the G20 protests in London, after a disciplinary hearing found he had committed gross misconduct. He headed a Scotland Yard panel that dismissed misconduct charges in 2019 against five officers involved in an incident that led to the death of Sean Rigg, a black musician.",News/UK news,Senior Met commander faces sack for allegedly taking illegal drugs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/senior-met-commander-julian-bennett-faces-sack-allegedly-taking-illegal-drugs
2/15/2022,"Before the Super Bowl could officially kick off in Los Angeles, someone had to raise the curtain on this distinctly post-Covid festival of American glitz and glamour – so why not the biggest movie star on the planet. In a WWE-style teaser that played over the enormous video board that hovers over SoFi Stadium like a serpentine halo, the Rock set the tone for Super Gold Sunday, TV-speak for the cosmic-like coincidence of a Super Bowl falling during the middle weekend of the Winter Olympics – a first. Over the course of a two-minute monologue the actor-wrestler also known as Dwayne Johnson valorized the gladiators here as well as the others gritting it out under our flag in the Beijing Olympics. And he made sure to justify why we should stay tuned to the exception of all else. “It’s about the idea that this game [the Super Bowl] and these Games [the Olympics] can achieve one of the most precious feats of all – bringing us all together for a celebration of who we are.”  And as 70,000 fans at SoFi Stadium lost their minds when the Rock was revealed at midfield, a cordless mic in the grip of his anaconda-like right arm and a single eyebrow arched, you couldn’t help but wonder: Um, who are we exactly? Set aside for a moment the fact that the Beijing Olympics have been less a celebration of human achievement than a panoply of human rights crises, free speech and press crackdowns and doping-aided cheating scandals; what’s more, the Games appear to be filling time until war breaks out in Ukraine. Here in Los Angeles, the Super Bowl followed the Hollywood cliche of a tale of two cities. Amid the star-studded confines of SoFi Stadium was a story of wretched excess. But the scene outside offered a sadder story of the city’s many unhoused citizens. True, it’s a story as old as modern capitalism itself. And as a former Californian I was sadly prepared for the sight of people living in tents on downtown city streets just trying to survive. Still: there was something about the weekend’s juxtaposition of haves and have nots that was especially jarring. It’s one thing for a city to help erect a $5bn stadium less than an hour’s drive from Skid Row. It’s quite another for jersey-wearing fans, many holding four-figure tickets for the big game, to sidestep Angelenos pushing belongings-filled shopping carts or passed out on the sidewalk altogether along the route to the pregame carnival around the LA Convention Center. The unhoused who weren’t totally left alone were shooed away by street sweepers and security forces on bikes. These Dickensian scenes unfolded amid near-90-degree temperatures, a reminder of yet another way in which one of the more hospitable refuges for the unhoused is becoming increasingly untenable. It’s a class disparity that only figures to widen as LA builds itself up to host the 2028 Summer Games, both literally and figuratively. But of course the Super Bowl’s job isn’t to call attention to that. Its job is to entertain. It’s to stage a $9m half-time show headlined by a kid from Compton who parlayed his musical talent to pull himself out of inner-city poverty on the way to becoming a near billionaire. It’s about Sean Penn, Martha Stewart and other loaded A-listers rooting on the equally well-heeled celebrities on the field. It’s about suspending disbelief to properly immerse ourselves in entertainment. It’s about dreaming of who we could be instead of accepting what we are – one nation, under consumption, ever divisible. The only notable exception is the Rock. Everybody genuinely seems to like him. The Super Bowl was supposed to be LA’s comeback party. But if anything, it showed just how much the place hasn’t changed. This is very much still a city in which staggering wealth and abject poverty coexist without ever really touching, like so much oil and vinegar. When it comes to all-American celebrations of who we are, in the end, the city was a perfect host.",News/US news,"LA Super Bowl was a Hollywood cliche of rags and riches, cheek by jowl ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/super-bowl-los-angeles-hollywood-cliche-rags-riches
2/15/2022,"NatWest has become the first bank this year to announce it will close some of its outlets as customers shun branches for mobile banking. The high street lender will shut 32 branches across its NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland brands in England and Wales over the next year.  The bank, which is majority owned by the taxpayer, said the closures were a result of customers shifting to mobile and online banking “because it is faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives”. It confirmed 21 of the closures would be NatWest branches, and 11 of them RBS. Planned closures include the RBS branch in NatWest’s headquarters in Bishopsgate, in the heart of the City of London. Most staff will be moved to other branches, but 12 jobs will be at risk. A report by the banking trade body UK Finance underlined the rapid pace of change in spending habits during the pandemic, with more people retreating from cash and opting for phones and computers to pay for goods and services online. NatWest’s move may fuel concerns about millions of people being left behind as the shift to a cashless society speeds up. About 1.2 million consumers mainly used cash for their day-to-day spending during 2020, down from 2.1 million people in 2019. Addressing concerns about how the closures will impact groups who do not use digital services, the bank said: “We take our responsibility seriously to support the people who face challenges in moving online, so we are investing to provide them with support and alternatives that work for them.” NatWest will contact vulnerable customers ahead of the closures to discuss alternative payment methods, a spokesperson said, alongside the rollout of a new nationwide postal cash delivery service. The round of cuts comes after consumer organisation Citizens Advice revealed more than 200 post offices have closed in the past two years – the equivalent of two a week – leaving “huge gaps” in communities that depend on them for essential tasks such as paying bills. Older and disabled people, carers, and people who don’t use the internet are also disproportionately affected, the report said. The government owns about 52% of NatWest after spending £45bn bailing out the lender 13 years ago. It plans to sell a stake over the next year in a trading plan that will return the bank to majority private ownership. Analysts predict the bank’s operating profit before tax in 2021, to be announced on Friday, will be just above £4bn.",News/Business,NatWest to close 32 branches as more customers move online,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/natwest-to-close-32-branches-as-more-customers-move-online
2/15/2022,"Vladimir Putin has suggested it is still not too late for dialogue over Ukraine, as the world continues to be left guessing whether the Russian president is on the brink of invading his neighbour, or whether his military buildup is a negotiating ploy. In a meeting in the Kremlin, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told Putin he believed there was still room for dialogue on Russian requests for a new security deal with the west, which have been made as Russia amassed 140,000 troops around Ukraine’s borders in recent weeks.  “It seems to me that our possibilities are far from being exhausted. They certainly should not continue indefinitely. But at this stage I would suggest that they continue and be intensified,” Lavrov told Putin. Putin, who has taken to holding meetings with extreme social distancing owing to a fear of contracting Covid, gave his assent from the other end of an extremely long table. The footage released from the meeting appeared carefully choreographed to send a message about Kremlin thinking. “We warn against endless conversations on issues that need to be resolved today. Still, as the foreign minister, I should say that there is always a chance,” said Lavrov. At the same time, a senior Russian diplomat told the Guardian that Russia would be within its rights to “counterattack” against Ukraine if it felt Kyiv was threatening the population of eastern Ukraine. “We will not invade Ukraine unless we are provoked to do that,” said Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the EU, in an interview in Brussels. “If the Ukrainians launch an attack against Russia, you shouldn’t be surprised if we counterattack. Or, if they start blatantly killing Russian citizens anywhere – Donbas or wherever,” he said. Donbas is the region of eastern Ukraine where Russia has armed and funded an insurgency since 2014, and where the Kremlin has handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports. In January, US officials briefed journalists on intelligence they claimed showed that Russia was preparing a “false flag” incident that could be used as a pretext for an intervention. In this context, Chizhov’s words about a Russian response to a Ukrainian attack will sound ominous to Western officials, especially as there is no sign Ukraine currently has any desire to attack its much larger and more powerful neighbour. Russia has massed an estimated 145,000 troops along various stretches of its border with Ukraine, in Belarus where joint military drills are taking place, and in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014. US officials said over the weekend that Russia had accelerated plans for an invasion and could launch a full-scale land and air assault as soon as Wednesday. On Monday, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced that the last few US diplomats in the Kyiv embassy would move west to Lviv, “due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces”. On Saturday, a senior state department official told reporters that a handful of American diplomats would stay in the capital “to be able to continue working closely with the Ukrainian government and to be able to ensure we’ve got the best possible information for our senior leaders and the President about what’s happening broadly in society”. The change of mind two days later suggests that US security assessments have darkened still further. Western diplomatic efforts to avert an invasion continued on Monday, with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Kyiv. “The sovereignty and territorial independence of Ukraine are non-negotiable,” said Scholz, speaking alongside Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, after a bilateral meeting. On Tuesday, Scholz will meet Putin in Moscow, a week after France’s Emmanuel Macron also visited both capital cities in an attempt to seek paths for de-escalation. In five hours of one-on-one talks over dinner in the Kremlin, Putin is reported to have spent a long time lecturing Macron on historical Russian grievances. Putin has claimed that Ukraine joining Nato would inevitably lead to war between Russia and the alliance. On Monday morning, Ukraine’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, said Kyiv might consider giving up its ambition of Nato membership if it would help de-escalate the situation. The foreign ministry quickly said Prystaiko’s words had been taken out of context and other officials also played down the remarks. While most western officials believe Ukraine has little chance of joining Nato any time soon, they are reluctant to publicly rule out the possibility. “The Russian government is turning something into a big political issue that isn’t really currently on the agenda,” Scholz said in Kyiv. After the US warnings of imminent military action, diplomats from numerous countries, including the US, Canada and Australia have evacuated from Kyiv and are running small emergency diplomatic missions from the western city of Lviv. Many European countries, where there is some scepticism about the US warnings, have decided to keep a diplomatic presence in Kyiv. The British ambassador has also remained in Kyiv, along with a core team. “It’s a big mistake that some embassies moved to western Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said on Monday. “It’s their decision, but ‘western Ukraine’ doesn’t exist. It’s united Ukraine. If something happens, God forbid, it will happen everywhere.” Most scheduled flights to Ukraine continued to operate on Monday after the government announced a $592m (£437m) fund to help keep Ukraine’s airspace open, as some insurers refuse to cover aircraft following the US warnings. The Dutch airline KLM has stopped all flights to Ukraine, while Lufthansa has said it is considering a suspension. The low-cost airline SkyUp, which had to divert a plane to Moldova on Sunday after the company that owned the plane banned it from entering Ukrainian airspace, said it had resumed ticket sales after coming to an agreement with the Ukrainian government. “Negotiations with insurers have been difficult and our foreign partners continue to regularly assess their own risks and monitor the situation,” the airline said in a statement. Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called for calm, saying they see the threat on the border but do not believe Russia will launch a full-scale invasion and that the apocalyptic US messaging is only serving to create panic and chaos economic chaos. “Keep calm. Don’t panic. This is not 2014, Ukraine has become stronger and better organised,” said the interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, in a video address on Monday.",News/World news,Vladimir Putin suggests dialogue is still possible on Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/vladimir-putin-suggests-dialogue-is-still-possible-on-ukraine-crisis
2/15/2022,"Ministers are pressing ahead with plans to start winding down Covid testing and payments for isolation from next week to save more than £10bn, despite health chiefs warning this could hamper crucial research into antiviral treatments. No 10, the Treasury and the health department will decide this week on a “living with Covid strategy” due to be unveiled on Monday, which will involve phasing out free Covid testing and all but ending the tracing system.  Whitehall sources say the Treasury is driving efforts to reduce costs from an estimated annual £15bn, with an opening suggestion of cutting the budget by more than 90%, to £1.3bn. It is unclear whether the changes will be England-only or apply UK-wide. Under plans for the “living with Covid strategy”, from Monday 21 February people will no longer be advised to test regularly if they are asymptomatic. From this date the government is also likely to end support payments worth £500 to £750 for people isolating, as well as routine contact tracing. Boris Johnson previously announced plans to end mandatory isolation for people who test positive from next week. From 31 March the government is likely to end free PCR testing for people with symptoms, apart from in hospitals and high-risk settings and for more than 1m of the most vulnerable people. Those with symptoms are expected to be advised to take lateral flow tests (LFTs), although free tests may be limited to older age groups. The government is also likely to stop recommending LFTs on days five and six after a positive test, and to end free LFTs for asymptomatic testing. However, the government’s public health experts are concerned that a £1.3bn settlement would be insufficient to cover the costs of free LFTs for key groups, the Guardian understands. They fear slashing the testing budget could also be counterproductive and damage a planned move to a “test to treat” strategy, where the most vulnerable people are identified and treated with antiviral dugs in an effort to cut deaths. A growing repertoire of antiviral medicines, including molnupiravir and paxlovid, are being used on patients who have contracted Covid. They work by disrupting a virus’s ability to replicate inside an infected cell. In particular, government health officials worry that such a steep cut in the budget could harm the work of the Panoramic study examining widening the cohort of those eligible for antivirals from at least 1.3 million to between 5 million and 30 million people. This research relies on enough vulnerable and older people testing positive for Covid. The government has said it wants to move to a scenario where antivirals are given to all those who are most at risk of severe disease, with significant stocks of drugs already paid for. One Whitehall source said a large reduction in community testing in the coming months could harm the ability of the Panoramic trial to continue. Another Whitehall health source said Covid antivirals were one of the main tools for “learning to live with Covid” by helping take pressure off the NHS. “If [the Treasury] basically put this trial in the bin, it’s very shortsighted,” they said. The Guardian revealed last week that the Treasury was pushing to phase out free Covid testing. Officials will this week send to No 10 and the Treasury the costs of continuing free LFTs for all symptomatic people or reducing it to various cohorts such as vulnerable or older age groups. There is likely to be a ministerial Quad meeting on Wednesday, a call with chief medical officers from the four nations of the UK on Thursday, finalisation of the plan on Friday and a Covid-O meeting on Sunday. The strategy, fronted by Boris Johnson, is expected to be unveiled on Monday. The move to cut funding for free testing has already caused consternation in the devolved administrations. On Monday the SNP called on the UK government to confirm it will continue to fund Covid testing in Scotland. Martyn Day, the SNP’s Westminster health spokesperson, said: “Any changes to Covid testing must be guided by expert public health advice through the chief medical officers … Scotland’s more safe and cautious approach to the pandemic has seen better outcomes. We must continue to be guided by the scientific evidence, and not by Downing Street’s concerns over the number of letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson from Tory MPs.” Asked on Monday about whether he was planning to scrap free PCR tests, Johnson said: “We’ll continue to work with our colleagues in Scotland but I believe the similarities in our approach vastly outweigh the differences.” A No 10 spokesperson said: “We haven’t made any final decisions on the future of testing. We have said free testing will come to an end at the right moment. Those decisions need to be made this week in terms of exactly when that time is, what comes to an end and what is retained. All of that will be considered and we will set it out in the strategy. We will retain the ability to monitor coronavirus as we do with other viruses.” Ministers’ plans, according to sources, include: 21 February Scrap guidance recommending regular asymptomatic testing with lateral flow tests; testing in education settings; test-and-trace support payments; tracing close contacts of positive cases. Week of 21 February Scrap mandatory isolation for positive Covid cases, though advice to stay home remains. 31 March Scrap free LFTs for asymptomatic people; free PCR testing for all but vulnerable people and those in hospitals and high-risk settings; recommendation of day five and six LFTs for those who have tested positive. Recommend free LFTs for everyone with Covid symptoms, or only older/vulnerable cohorts.",News/Politics,UK ministers press ahead with plan to wind down Covid testing,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/14/uk-ministers-press-ahead-with-plan-to-wind-down-covid-testing
2/15/2022,"Plans to offer Covid vaccinations to all children aged five to 11 have been delayed by the government because the jabs have not been deemed urgent. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decided more than a week ago to expand the Covid vaccination programme to all those aged five to 11 and handed its advice to ministers.  However, the government has not publicly declared whether it will go ahead with the offer and is still “reviewing” the evidence for another week, which is a break with its previous moves to accept JCVI advice straight away. The decision is now expected to be announced on 21 February, when a long-term strategy for “living with Covid” is to be outlined by Boris Johnson. It is understood any vaccination programme for this age group would not start until Easter at the earliest. JCVI members told the Guardian they were in the dark as to reasons for the delay. But the hold-up appears, at least in part, to be down to the JCVI advice that the jabs are non-urgent. A government spokesperson said: “We have received advice from the JCVI as part of the wider work on the living with Covid strategy so we will set out more details in due course. You can expect more detail next week.” The decision to offer the jab to clinically vulnerable children in the five to 11 age group was made in December. Prof Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, criticised the approach. “I definitely welcome the news that parents are given the choice whether to vaccinate their primary school-age children with a vaccine that has proven both very safe and very effective. Unfortunately it is coming too late to prevent the maybe half a million or more infections in five- to 11-year-olds this year so far, and the lack of transparency around JCVI decision-making and government intervention remains worrying,” she said. “Waiting until after the end of term seems perverse, when rates in that age group are the highest in all age groups. This delay in announcing is just causing additional stress and confusion for the many families that have been waiting to vaccinate their children with no clarity.” Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at the University of Swansea, also expressed concern. “The fact that the JCVI have now apparently recommended the offer, and the UK government have delayed action on this, despite the fact that a majority of parents report wanting it for their children, and the fact that Covid is ripping through the primary school population, beggars belief,” he said. Dr Nathalie MacDermott of King’s College London, a clinical doctor sub-specialising in paediatric infectious diseases in the NHS, also raised questions about transparency. “It is unusual that the government have chosen not to announce the decision made by the JCVI in relation to the immunisation of five- to 11-year-olds against Covid-19, particularly as they have not given a clear reason for this,” she said. “If they are doing this because they are seeking information or evidence from other sectors then this is perhaps understandable, but then this reason should be clearly stated … To simply delay … without giving a reason, when it is public knowledge a decision has been made, raises concerns, not least since recent comments and decisions relating to public health no longer seem to be ‘following the science’.” Mike Short, Unison’s head of education, said: “Offering the vaccine to younger children is crucial if many more hours of learning are not to be lost. Ministers should stop dithering and announce jab plans for all primary pupils to reassure parents and school staff. “Covid is running rife in schools. The half-term holidays should help infection rates, but the prime minister’s decision to jettison sensible isolation rules next week could make everything significantly worse.” Prof Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said: “Additional issues which come into play include how to schedule these vaccinations in the context not only of Covid vaccination delivery but also delivering other childhood vaccines, which are equally important in this age group, in the context of a service which is overstretched.”",News/Society,Plans to delay Covid jabs for UK children aged five to 11 criticised ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/14/plans-to-delay-covid-jabs-for-uk-children-aged-five-to-11-criticised
2/15/2022,"Though the Cuban-American artist Carmen Herrera, who has died aged 106, spent 70 years refining her painting style into a severe yet seductive form of geometric abstraction, her pioneering work remained largely unrecognised by the art world until she was in her early 90s. From thereon, however, it received popular acclaim, with myriad museum exhibitions dedicated to the artist’s paintings and occasional forays into sculpture. Her work, she said in 2005, has been a “lifelong process of purification, a process of taking away what isn’t essential”. The artist was an early adopter of an aesthetic that has an affinity to American colour field painting, op art and Latin American neo-concretism. A typical Herrera painting does no more than balance two planes of contrasting colour across a large canvas. Each work in the Blanco y Verde series (1959-71), for example, is painted uniformly white in acrylic, bar the imposition of one or several green triangles, each with slight variations in acuteness, which stretch the width or length of the composition.  The artist rejected painting as intuitive practice. Her paintings were carefully planned through scale drawings on tracing paper, complete with annotated measurements, which would later be replicated in acrylic on canvas. Her later work became sharper, more angular. Curves were banished. “I never met a straight line I did not like,” she noted in 2010. Herrera also made human-scale wood sculptures. Stylistically echoing the acrylic works, these tended to balance multiple parts, painted a flat primary colour monochrome, into simple geometric arrangements. Untitled (1971), now part of the collection at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, consists of a rectangular block of wood, over a metre in height and width, yet just eight centimetres deep, on top of which is balanced a smaller rectangular wood block, similar in depth, and likewise painted royal blue. In later years she moved into public works, which she titled Estructuras Monumentales, her abstract compositions rendered in monochromatically painted aluminium. Despite a lifetime’s dedicated practice, Herrera was 89 when her big break came. In 2004, a fellow artist, Tony Bechara, ran into the New York dealer Frederico Sève at a dinner. Sève mentioned that one of the exhibitors had withdrawn from what was supposed to be a three-woman show he was curating of Latin American geometric abstraction. Bechara recommended Herrera as a replacement. Sève sold several of Herrera’s works off the back of the show, with the prominent New York collector and philanthropist Agnes Gund buying several and donating one to the Museum of Modern Art. That work, a large hypnotic black and white striped painting from 1952, was put on display in the 2007 survey exhibition New Perspectives in Latin American Art. In 2009 Herrera had a solo show at the Ikon gallery in Birmingham, piquing the interest of the gallerist Nicholas Logsdail. His gallery, Lisson, showed Herrera’s work for the first time in London in 2012, and inaugurated a New York space with an exhibition by the artist in 2016, the same year the Whitney Museum staged a retrospective. Born in Havana, Herrera was the second child of Carmela Nieto y Font and Antonio Herrera y López de la Torre. Her father was the founding editor of El Mundo, a progressive newspaper, her mother a journalist. Herrera was raised alongside her mother’s five children from a previous marriage. Antonio and Carmela were outspoken in their politics, Herrera’s mother ingraining a feminist attitude into her and her two half-sisters from a young age. As the Cuban general Gerardo Machado, elected president in 1925, grew increasingly despotic in his second term of office, Herrera’s parents largely evaded persecution. However many of her relatives, including two of her half-brothers, were harassed and imprisoned. In 1929, at the age of 14, Herrera left Cuba for finishing school in Paris, the first of several trips over her life to the French capital. Returning to Havana in 1931 she took a sculpture course at the Lyceum, a women’s college, building on the private tutelage she had received when aged eight from the painter Federico Edelmann y Pinto. Those early exercises in sketching classical sculpture served her well.The first work she exhibited, Cristo, in 1937, consisted of a tearful mahogany-carved Christ set on a mount bearing a swastika. It was part of a group exhibition in a public park – the art was hung from trees; Herrera was “the spirit” behind the show according to one critic. The same year she met Jesse Loewenthal, an English teacher visiting from the US, and their courtship continued after Loewenthal returned home. In 1938 she enrolled on an architecture course at the Universidad de La Habana. “Modern architecture was interesting to me. I loved spaces, shapes, and lines,” she said in an interview with Artnet in 2016. However, she was forced to abandon her studies after a year due to the volatile political situation. “There were always revolutions going on, and fighting in the streets. The university was closed most of the time, so it affected my studies,” she said in a Guardian interview in 2016. Fulgencio Batista came to power for the first time in 1940 (having served four years democratically he would return in 1952 to establish a US-backed dictatorship), establishing a semblance of stability, but by then Herrera had left Havana to be reunited with Loewenthal in New York. They married in 1939. In the US Herrera took an apprenticeship with the Austrian-born painter Samuel Brecher. Despite her teacher’s adherence to realism, Herrera made tentative steps towards abstraction. Two surviving early portraits, one of a male figure, another a female, make use of blocks of colour delineating parts of the bodies and background. From 1943 to 1947 she studied at the Art Students League in New York, but was increasingly dissatisfied with the traditional approach of her teachers. She later noted that her friendship with the abstract artist Barnett Newman and his wife, Annalee, proved the greater education. “He had such incredible insight into the artist,” she said. “And that was the best university you could have.” In 1948 Herrera and Loewenthal moved to Paris. Living on the Left Bank in Montparnasse, she made contact with Sonia Delaunay, Jean Arp and other prominent figures of the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles. It was under their influence that Herrera dropped the lingering remnants of figuration. “It was a struggle,” she noted in a 2010 interview with the Guardian of this development in her art. “An interesting struggle.” In 1950 she had her first solo show, back at the Lyceum in Havana, where she showed a series of large, angry, gestural paintings, works which she described as a reaction against her home city. The artist noted that the reception from the local audience was largely negative. Green Garden (1950), made back in Paris, was the last of Herrera’s work that had any subject other than the formal devices of geometry and colour. Framed against a brown background were curving organic forms in a variety of green tones. The canvas was stretched around a circular frame, the first of many irregular shaped paintings. Iberic, painted a year later, took similar form, but this time, bar unity in the autumnal, burnished red, orange and black interlocking shapes, it bore not the slightest allusion to figuration. The couple returned to New York in 1954. Herrera then stayed in the US, despite the lack of attention afforded her work. Two years later she had a solo exhibition and work included in two group shows, both of which focused on Cuban art, something that irritated her. “I don’t believe the ‘Cuban painter’ exists,” she later stated. “The artist is universal.” Between 1958 and 1962 she did not exhibit at all and she and her husband struggled financially. Fidel Castro assumed power in 1959 and rent payments from a family property in Havana failed to get through. Herrera made efforts to bring some of her family’s more valuable belongings to New York and put them up for sale. A year later her brother Antonio was given a 22-year prison sentence for “anti-revolutionary activity”. For the next four decades she fell into a cycle of occasional small solo exhibitions and only slightly more frequent participation in groups shows. In the late 1960s she was awarded two fellowships from the Cintas Foundation and in 1977 a grant by the Creative Artists Public Service, but Herrera and Loewenthal sought out a cheap neighbourhood so they could live solely on his teaching salary. From 1988 to 2005 she managed only a single solo show, at El Museo del Barrio, New York, an exhibition of her black and white paintings from the 1950s. She blamed her lack of success unequivocally on sexism. She recalled being explicitly told that while she was a great painter, a gallerist could not give her a show because of her gender. “Everything was controlled by men,” she noted. “Not just art.” Now Herrera’s work is held in the collections of the Smithsonian and the Hirshhorn museums in Washington; the Pérez Art Museum, Miami; Tate Modern in London; and the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Havana; as well as MoMa, the Whitney and the Walker. In 2019 her public sculpture was shown in City Hall Park in New York, moving to Buffalo Bayou Park in Houston in 2020 to coincide with a retrospective at the city’s Museum of Fine Arts. In 2019 she was made an honorary Royal Academician, the French government awarding her the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres the following year. “I was left alone to refine and distil my art for decades,” she said of her late-starting career. “I have no regrets.” Loewenthal died in 2000.
