3/21/2022,"As violent winds battered the Californian desert across the weekend, disturbing countless tennis players in its wake, a new American champion emerged from the chaos of the BNP Paribas Open. Taylor Fritz, 24, finished the tournament of his life by holding his nerve in the tightest moments to upset Rafael Nadal 6-3, 7-6(5) and win his first Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells. In the women’s singles, Iga Swiatek further built on her exceptional start to the season and her profile as the most promising young player today as she defeated Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-1 to win her second consecutive WTA 1000 title and move to 20-3 (87%) this season. The build-up to the men’s match had centred around Fritz’s condition after he tweaked his ankle in Saturday’s semi-final and then aborted his practice hours before the biggest match of his life. When he arrived on court, all eyes settled on the blue tape rising up from the white sock on his right foot. “I went through a rollercoaster of emotions before the match, from thinking ‘there’s no way I could possibly play’, then doing so much work on the ankle, then going out, hitting on one of the back courts, all of a sudden thinking: ‘oh my god maybe I can play’,” said Fritz. But instead of hobbling around the court, Fritz rose to the moment. He opened the match attacking relentlessly off both wings, unloaded on forehands whenever the opportunity presented itself and combined with seamless serving to quickly establish a 4-0, double-break lead. While he played tremendously well, with every passing game, attention shifted from his own injury to the ailment across the net that played an even greater role in the match. Nadal had issues with his left chest area in his spectacular semi-final match against Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz. Against Fritz, his service speeds had fallen off a cliff, he winced when lunging to retrieve forehands and he offered minimal resistance to the American’s barrage. But in the second set, after a medical timeout, Nadal fought with everything he had and he stood on the verge of pushing Fritz into a nervous third set numerous times. But through all the obstacles that followed, from an early break for Nadal, to multiple long, tight service games, a squandered championship point and then an impossibly tight tiebreak, Fritz overcame each in turn to seal the match of his life. Fritz, one of a number of talented American players around his age growing steadily if not spectacularly, has been one of the most improved players in recent months. His rise began at the winter edition of Indian Wells in October when he reached the semi-final, and he has since compiled a 5-3 record against top 10 players, moving from 39th in October to his pre-tournament career high of 16. He will now leave Indian Wells as the world No 13 and, most importantly, a Masters 1000 champion: “Winning this tournament especially, Indian Wells, this is one of those childhood dreams that you just never even think could come true,” said Fritz, who is from California. “I just keep saying ‘no, no, just no way it’s real.’” After his greatest ever start to a season, a spotless 20-match winning streak with three titles, including the Australian Open, and a final, Nadal’s great run comes to an end. Having already withdrawn from the Miami Open, he will now return to Spain in order to recover and prepare for an imminent clay court season. Few will look forward to facing him there. For Swiatek, an 11th match win in succession marked another crucial step up in her career as she continues to distance herself from the rest of her contemporaries as the biggest talent of her generation. After blitzing the field to shock French Open in 2020 aged 19 and an extremely solid sophomore season inside the top 10, she has started this year by taking her growth to hard courts. Swiatek has now won the first two WTA 1000 titles of the year, Doha and Indian Wells, in addition to a hard-fought semi-final run at the Australian Open. Mentally, she has become comfortable as a top player and she is ready to push for more. She is quietly building her well-rounded game, moving forward to the net more, incorporating more variety into her game while also pushing herself to play with a far more attacking mindset, looking to bully opponents with her vast weaponry and then making the adjustments as matches go on. The final itself was volatile due to the wind, with countless breaks and swings in momentum in the opening set. But Swiatek managed her nerves far better than Sakkari and she attacked through the wind with greater margin and intelligence. She completed her first big title with just five games lost which, incredibly, is the joint most she has conceded in her four one-sided big finals. While Swiatek leaves as the new world number two, right on track as she looks to further fulfil her incredible potential across all surfaces, she is still learning the full breadth of her powers: “It’s pretty crazy because I wasn’t expecting to be in that place, honestly, especially after playing so well in previous tournaments,” she said. “I didn’t know it’s possible for me to play this well and [for] this long.”",Sport/Sport,Taylor Fritz hands Rafael Nadal first loss of 2022 with win in Indian Wells final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/taylor-fritz-hands-rafael-nadal-first-loss-of-2022-with-win-in-indian-wells-final
3/21/2022,"Scott Morrison has signalled further measures to counter the rising cost of living, potentially including temporary petrol excise cuts, as the Coalition mulls federal implications from the Liberal loss in South Australia. The prime minister travelled to Brisbane on Monday campaigning on the commonwealth’s $667m investment in the south-east Queensland city deal, primarily for transport projects, ahead of the federal budget on 29 March. For weeks, the Morrison government has been signalling possible action on petrol prices and targeted cash payments for low- and middle-income earners as ways to combat the rising cost of living. In SA, Labor’s Peter Malinauskas defeated the first term Liberal government with a 7% swing by campaigning on health funding and cost-of-living pressures. The victory is the first loss in Australia of an incumbent government since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to warnings that Morrison had damaged the Liberal brand in the state, and that a bigger agenda for the next term of government could trump pandemic management in voters’ minds. Morrison told reporters in Brisbane the government was “very conscious of cost-of-living impacts, particularly at the moment, with the war in Ukraine and the impact that that is especially having on fuel prices”. He argued high fuel prices, which have hit $2.20 in some parts of Australia, “don’t just hit the economy and hit family budgets when they fill up, but they have a knock-on effect across the economy”. “We’ve been carefully considering our response to ensure that we can deliver a budget that both addresses those immediate needs but also ensures that we continue on with our strong economic plan for a stronger economy.” Earlier, Morrison told 4BC radio that the spike in petrol prices “won’t go forever” and the government would not engage in a “kneejerk” response, suggesting that any move to reduce excise, which adds 44.2 cents to the price of petrol, would be temporary. Mark Butler, the federal Labor health spokesperson and a senior South Australian in Anthony Albanese’s shadow ministry, said that Malinauskas, like federal Labor, had “been very busy preparing a focused policy agenda that would look beyond the pandemic”. Butler said that defeated premier, Stephen Marshall, and the federal Liberals “consistently pat themselves on the back about the state of the economy”. “That doesn’t reflect the real lives of working Australians,” Butler told ABC Radio National. “Household budgets are being smashed by flat wages and rising household costs.” “Talking to the economic reality of Australia today is a strong lesson out of the South Australian election,” he said, in addition to a focus on healthcare. Butler said Labor research revealed one in two voters were less likely to vote for Marshall when they learned he was from the same party as Morrison. He noted reports that the New South Wales Liberals also want the prime minister to keep a low profile in their seats in the federal campaign. On Sunday Labor’s national president, Wayne Swan, said the SA election result should have Morrison’s Coalition “trembling” ahead of the federal poll. Morrison dismissed state and federal comparisons, saying “Anthony Albanese is not Peter Malinauskas”. On Monday Morrison appeared alongside Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to spruik the $1.8bn city deal between the federal, state and local governments. The deal includes a $450m investment in the Gabba Brisbane metro station for upgrades to support the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games. On Sunday the Grattan Institute released a report finding that both major parties had targeted their election spending promises at marginal seats and just one of the 71 Coalition transport promises worth $100m or more was based on a business case approved by Infrastructure Australia. Morrison insisted that “every electorate in every part of the country obviously matters”. “The city deals are developed as a partnership,” he said. “So the priorities for the projects are worked up between the parties.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison signals budget measures to counter soaring petrol prices and cost of living,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/scott-morrison-signals-budget-measures-to-counter-soaring-petrol-prices-and-cost-of-living
3/21/2022,"An otherwise healthy toddler was one of four people in New South Wales to die with Covid over the past 24 hours, with the state recording a further 14,970 cases. NSW Health reported the two-year-old’s death on Monday, describing it as tragic. “A previously well two-year-old child from Sydney died at the Children’s hospital at Westmead due to Covid-19 infection,” NSW Health said in a statement. “NSW Health asks for the privacy of this child’s family to be respected during this most difficult time.” Children under five are not eligible for any Covid vaccines in Australia. Three adults also died from the virus – taking the state’s Covid death toll to 2,027. Each of the adults, aged in their 70s, 80s and 90s, had received two doses of the vaccine. Hospitalisations of people with Covid have increased over the past fortnight, jumping from 1,066 to 1,163. Prof Adrian Esterman, a former World Health Organization epidemiologist from the University of South Australia, described the child’s death as “extremely unusual”. “Kids and even young kids do die from Covid, but they usually have an underlying health condition,” Esterman said. “That is very, very unusual but it does happen. “We get some highly fit and athletic 20-year-olds dying, but again, it’s unusual.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Esterman predicted the state’s cases would continue to grow and expects about 30,000 daily cases within a fortnight if public health settings remained the same. He said did not expect hospitalisations to rise at the same rate. “We’re getting a younger and younger age group being infected and they don’t get quite as sick,” he said. “We’re starting to see hospitalisations going up definitely but not at the same rate as cases.” Children and teenagers have recorded the most Covid infections over the past month, with schools and extracurricular activities returning. Just under half of children across the state aged between five and 11 have received one vaccine dose, according to NSW Health.",News/Australia news,‘Previously well’ two-year-old child dies in Sydney hospital with Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/previously-well-two-year-old-child-dies-in-sydney-hospital-with-covid
