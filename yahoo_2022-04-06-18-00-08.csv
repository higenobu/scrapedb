4/6/2022,"Two-time Academy Award-winner Sean Penn joined Hannity, Tuesday, to speak about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Penn was in Ukraine filming a documentary the day it was invaded, and has since been back and seen the devastation firsthand. Sean Hannity began what turned out to be a lengthy, civil conversation, despite glaring political differences between the two, by recalling their first conversation. Hannity called Penn to invite him on the show to discuss Ukraine, but did not originally get the response he may have expected. According to both Penn and Hannity, the first thing Penn did was tell Hannity that he doesn’t trust him. “Is there a reason you didn’t trust me?” Hannity asked while laughing. “Yeah,” Penn replied, “there are a lot of reasons I don’t trust you.” Hannity had a hard time letting that go, and the issue of trust would come up again. But Penn said he didn’t get hung up on his lack of trust for Hannity because what’s happening in Ukraine is too important. “I don’t think that I’ve got time to indulge my lack of trust, which becomes a petty thing as people, and babies, are being vaporized,” Penn said. “And that these people are fighting for the very dreams that are the aspirations of all of us Americans. We talked about that too, and we agreed on that.” Penn spoke about first meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last fall, months before the invasion, when Hannity once again broached the issue of trust. “It’s interesting,” Penn said. “We had met initially on a Zoom call back…” “Did you trust him?” Hannity cut in, “A lot more than me.” “I was interested to see who he was,” Penn said, “and I didn’t have the baggage with him I have with you.” Hannity soon found out that the baggage Penn spoke of goes back to January of 2007 when Hannity referred to Penn as an “all around very angry man” and named him as “enemy of the state” for statements he’d made about the Bush administration. According to Hannity at the time, Penn had also called him “a whore.” “What is the baggage?” Hannity asked. “We never met before.” “Well, actually, I have… as a badge of honor at my house,” Penn said, “I got the full screen that I dominate as an enemy of the state with you in the foreground.” Hannity gave it one more shot at the end of the interview, asking why Penn still doesn’t trust him, so Penn summed up his continued lack of trust with an analogy. “You know what happens is that there’s a lot of physical therapy necessary after a big car accident,” Penn said. “You don’t get it all done in a day.” Hannity airs weeknights at 9 p.m. on Fox News Channel. Watch Andy Cohen apologize to nurses after off-the-cuff remark: 'They are beautiful inside and out' On  Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen Monday, Cohen had some explaining to do after offending nurses worldwide. One of Cohen’s guests was Ciara Miller, a nurse and member of the cast of Bravo TV’s Summer House. Cohen was stunned that a nurse could be as attractive as Miller.
“Hi, Ciara, you’re looking so beautiful. Wow,” Cohen said. You’re actually a nurse?” When Miller said yes, Cohen responded, “And this is what you look like? Wow.”
Viewers took to Twitter chiding Cohen’s comments. One registered nurse even posted pictures of herself to prove Cohen wrong. About halfway through the show, Cohen became aware of the backlash and issued an apology.
“Just want to say before going on, I have offended the nurses of America and internationally. I apologize,” Cohen said. “I was merely mentioning that Ciara looks like a supermodel. I know that many nurses look — it’s no condemnation of nurses.”
Miller interrupted, saying, “All nurses are hot.”
“All nurses are hot,” Cohen agreed. “But the most important thing is, all nurses have the biggest hearts in the universe, and they are beautiful inside and out. I am sorry if I offended anyone.” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: 'Secrets of Playboy' inspires another woman to come forward and accuse Hugh Hefner of rape The Show sadly stops for 'American Idol' darling Kelsie Dolin: 'You've already won the competition' Former Playboy cover model Lisa Guerrero says she 'dodged multiple bullets' at mansion Tell us what you think!

4/6/2022,"(Reuters) -A Russian regional official said on Wednesday that frontier guards in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine had come under fire, while schools in nearby Belgorod were evacuated after a bomb threat, according to the city's mayor. Moscow, which sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a ""special military operation"", has accused Ukraine of targeting Russian assets across the border. ""Yesterday... they tried to fire mortars at the position of our border guards in the Sudzhansky district,"" said Roman Starovoit, the governor of the Kursk region. ""Russian border guards returned fire... There were no casualties or damage on our side."" Reuters could not immediately verify the report. In response to a question about it, a spokesman for the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said: ""We do not have such information"". Starovoit said officials were in touch with the defence ministry and urged citizens to remain calm. In separate comments to the RIA news agency, he said the mortars fired at the Sudzha border crossing did not reach Russian territory. The mayor of the Russian city of Belgorod, some 35 km (22 miles) from the border with Ukraine, said schools had been evacuated after receiving bomb threats. ""We understand that this is part of the information pressure (campaign) against our region,"" mayor Anton Ivanov said, without saying who he thought was responsible for the threats. Russia last week accused Ukrainian military helicopters of carrying out an air strike against a fuel depot in Belgorod, one of Russia's main logistics hubs for its military campaign in Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official denied responsibility. The Kremlin said at the time that the incident did not create comfortable conditions to continue peace talks with Kyiv.
