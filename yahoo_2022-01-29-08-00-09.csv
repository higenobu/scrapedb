1/29/2022,"On a Christmas vacation in Jamaica, Beth Ring and her husband tested positive for COVID-19. After spending two days in a state-run quarantine hotel, the couple chartered a $35,000 flight home. Ring told Insider she wished she had a better quarantine plan or purchased travel insurance. On Christmas morning, Beth Ring was relaxing in a villa in Jamaica. Beth, 53, her husband Dan, 54, their five children, and their son's girlfriend were wrapping up an eight-day vacation at the Mais Oui Villa, a luxury accommodation they said cost around $2,250 a night. Beth told Insider they took a number of precautions: most had gotten their booster shots, they ate outdoors, chartered private boats to avoid strangers, masked up in public, and prioritized activities outside. However, as the trip came to a close, Beth said she noticed a dry throat and cough. The day before she was set to fly home to Chicago, Illinois, Beth said that she and her family took at-home antigen COVID-19 tests. A negative test was required to board their return flight, but Beth and her husband tested positive. The couple ended up spending two-and-a-half days in a government-run quarantine hotel before ultimately choosing to leave the mandated quarantine and pay $35,000 for a private air ambulance — a luxury service that is becoming increasingly popular among those who can afford it — to get home. At the time of their trip, Jamaica's Health Ministry required travelers who tested positive to quarantine for 10 days (the current policy has since been shortened to five days for US travelers, as long as you're asymptomatic). As part of the original policy, positive travelers would then have two options: either find accommodations at their own expense or go to a free, government-run quarantine hotel. Beth and Dan said they had limited options. Mais Oui is rented to one group at a time, and new guests were set to arrive, so quarantining there wasn't possible. Darrell Looney, an owner of the villa, told Insider that they do have reciprocal arrangements in place to accept COVID-19 positive guests with other villas and properties, however, at the time of Beth and Dan's travel, those locations were booked due to an influx of holiday vacationers. According to the Jamaica Observer, in December, Jamaica experienced a surge in tourists with numbers comparable to pre-COVID-19 times. Because of the influx of tourists, they also had trouble finding another hotel with an open room. ""Our hosts were making calls, trying to find us another villa where we could stay, but everything was booked,"" Beth said. They were able to book a room at the El Greco Resort, a free, government-run quarantine hotel. Beth said she knew El Greco wouldn't be the Mais Oui with its private chef, butler, or luxury environs. But she said spotty Wi-Fi, a lack of hot water, and concerns about the hotel's COVID-19 protocols cemented Beth and Dan's decision to charter the private flight home. (Representatives for Jamaica's Ministry of Health did not respond to Insider's requests for comment about the accommodations.) The couple started filling out paperwork for Air Ambulance Worldwide on December 26, shortly after checking in and wired Air Ambulance Worldwide $35,000. For a fee, a private air ambulance service could take Beth and Dan back to the US, and in the event that they got sicker, they'd be back home for medical care. They're hardly alone in seeking out this type of travel. Since March of 2020, there's been a surge in demand for the private air industry, whether for medical flights or pure leisure. Largely fueled by concerns over the pandemic, private jet travel removes the need to enter crowded airports or airplanes, making it a go-to option for those who can afford it, according to ABC News. As Wired put it, the pandemic has created a ""middle-class private jet boom"" and indeed, Bloomberg reported that departures this year from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport, a popular private-jet terminal, was up 61% from a year earlier and that private jet travel was 19% higher in Europe and Asia in October 2021 than it was for the same time period two years prior. And like the Rings' flight, these planes are not cheap. CNBC reported that a private flight for a family of four from New York City to Washington, DC, could easily cost between $10,000 to $50,000, while individual flights can range from $1,200 to $36,000 depending on the company, route, and amenities. Beth said she reached out to a few emergency air-evacuation companies for price estimates. Air Ambulance Worldwide quoted them between $30,000 and $35,000 for a flight, while another company quoted them twice that amount. Representatives for Air Ambulance Worldwide did not respond to Insider's request for comment. However, Ross Thompson, the CEO of Covac Global, a membership-based medical evacuation and repatriation company, told Insider that his company completed over 60 air evacuations between Christmas and January 6. Typically, Covac does two or three evacuations a month, he said. While some private planes exude opulence, medical charters are quite different. Beth and Dan said Air Ambulance Worldwide was able to find them a plane that could depart on December 29 if they had a letter of approval from Jamaica's medical director, the only way to end quarantine early. They submitted the request and waited, she told Insider, and after 20 minutes, the letter arrived stating that they did not comply with the ordered quarantine but were fit to fly, as the medical air evacuation was a permitted practice. They boarded the plane, and that evening it landed in Chicago. While a private plane typically conjures images of luxury, Beth said the flight wasn't a typical chartered flight since it was an air ambulance. Two medical professionals were on board with the couple, Beth and Dan wore masks the entire time, and there was no bathroom. Beth said they were fortunate to have the means to charter a flight and had they been able to quarantine at the Mais Oui, they might have considered staying, but going home as soon as possible was their goal. Beth said she thought booking a private villa would be the safest way to vacation since it seemed more isolated than a resort with Mais Oui's 11,000-square-feet of living space, fully vaccinated staff, hands-free check in, and meals served outdoors. ""We cannot guarantee that our guests won't get COVID-19, however, we go above and beyond most villas to provide an environment with protocols to reduce the odds as much as possible in our villa,"" Looney told Insider. But for future vacations, Beth said she's more likely to consider a resort — many of which have quarantine floors for guests who test positive — to avoid another state-run quarantine. She also told Insider she wished she did more research on COVID-19 travel insurance. Covac Global, for instance, costs between $750 to $1,000 depending on the location and length of a trip and covers the cost of a private flight if needed. Beth said she looked into Covac but said the company wasn't accepting clients at the time of her trip. ""We were lucky enough to buy ourselves out of trouble,"" Beth said, adding that she wondered what would've happened if a room at El Greco hadn't opened up and if she wasn't in the position to afford a chartered flight. ""There were so many ways it could've been worse,"" she said. ""We felt OK, our kids got to go home, and we weren't sick.""

1/29/2022,"A Manhattan federal jury heard about porn star Stormy Daniels’ belief that “poltergeists” and “shadow figures” haunt her Louisiana home as part of her disgraced former lawyer Michael Avenatti’s fraud and identity theft trial on Friday. Avenatti, the 50-year-old California litigator who is representing himself on charges he stole nearly $300,000 of Daniels’ $800,000 book advance, seemed eager to air the actress-turned-paranormal investigator’s dirty laundry and their behind-the-scenes attorney-client drama during her first full day of cross examination. As The Daily Beast reported, Avenatti clawed his way to national prominence in 2018, and nearly ran for president, while representing Daniels in her infamous hush-money lawsuit against President Trump. Thanks to Avenatti’s relentless showmanship and TV appearances, Daniels’ case against the commander-in-chief dominated the press for months. Time Is Running Out to Indict Trump for His Sex Hush Money Payment to Stormy Daniels Now Avenatti and Daniels have reunited as legal adversaries, with the 42-year-old entertainer testifying against him in a proceeding filled with fireworks—and ghost stories. Avenatti asked whether Daniels had claimed on her TV project Spooky Babes that she encountered unexplained and frightening experiences in her former home in New Orleans, and Daniels replied yes. He followed up by asking whether she’s made statements about her house containing “poltergeist phenomenon” and “shadow figures,” and if she heard voices. “They are press for our TV show, and I stand behind them,” Daniels said of her claims. The alleged hauntings began to escalate in March 2019 and led to her then-boyfriend to question her sanity, Avenatti argued. “Of course,” Daniels answered. “This is all documented.” Avenatti asked Daniels about a “portal” in her house that allowed a “dark entity to come through it,” and the actress replied, “That’s what I was told by a medium.” Under questioning by Avenatti, Daniels testified that the “dark entity” caused her ex-boyfriend, unprovoked, to attack her and break her collarbone. “According to you, [the boyfriend] was held underwater in a bathtub, screamed at you, choked you so hard he broke your collarbone,” Avenatti said. “You looked at him and there was no color or white in his eyes?” “Correct,” Daniels said. Daniels also claimed she felt a woman’s presence in her erstwhile home, saying the woman was crying over a child. This specter was cutting her wrists and attempting to kill herself, Daniels alleged. Avenatti probed Daniels’ comments even further, asking whether she once claimed a room in her house suddenly morphed and contained furniture that didn’t belong to her and she looked down to see her arm covered in blood. “At the time you began to think you were crazy?” Avenatti said, to which Daniels said, “Correct.” “Ms. Daniels, have you developed a weird obsession with the house which you still have?” Avenatti inquired. Daniels answered yes and testified that she “wants answers” on the alleged supernatural encounters there. Avenatti then referred to Daniels’ claims that the house had caused her a series of disturbing health symptoms, asking if she said she had a “mass” in her head.    A post shared by spooky babes show (@spookybabesshow) “A blockage,” Daniels clarified, adding that an energy healer doing a Reiki scan had discovered it. At that point in the morning’s testimony, Judge Jesse Furman asked Daniels to spell Reiki. Daniels testified that she worried she had a tumor because her hair was falling out and she had memory loss and headaches, as well as bleeding from her eyes, ears and nose. “Luckily I was wrong,” Daniels added of her fear of a brain tumor. She said the ailments disappeared once she moved out of the spooky domicile. Avenatti was undaunted in this line of questioning, undoubedtly aware that he was only beefing up the spectacle of his criminal trial. “Do the dead speak to you?” Avenatti asked, followed by, “Are you able to have conversations with them?” “Sometimes,” Daniels said. “We record them.” Then Avenatti focused on a supposedly haunted doll named Susan, who Daniels has claimed can talk and calls her “mommy.” “She can play the piano?” Avenatti asked. “Someone else saw that, yes,” Daniels answered. “I believe they were telling the truth.” Over the next few hours, Avenatti questioned Daniels about the crowdfunding website he set up for her legal battle with Trump and whether she used the proceeds to buy a truck. Daniels denied doing so. Avenatti asked Daniels about her ex-husband Glenn and whether her high-profile litigation with Trump prompted him to clear Daniels’ bank account and run off with their daughter. Daniels said yes, and confirmed she’d asked Avenatti to drop the complaint against the president in April 2018. But after Daniels’ book contract came through days later, she stayed the course in the civil court case, she said. Avenatti asked Daniels whether she’d ever claimed she didn’t want to hire him and had no choice. “I was out of options,” Daniels said, adding that most attorneys wanted money up front and some “were just afraid” of taking on Trump. Daniels worked in a few zingers, too. When Avenatti displayed her fee agreement with him, presenting her with the language that indicated he was “entitled to a reasonable percentage” of her book proceeds “to be agreed upon,” Daniels retorted, “You’re very entitled, yes.” Avenatti asked whether Daniels knew lawyers generally don't work for free. “That’s why I was shocked that you would… for $100,” Daniels testified. Stormy Daniels on Michael Avenatti: ""Every time I watch him work, I think, This is what it must have been like to see the Sistine Chapel being painted. But instead of paint, Michael uses the tears of his enemies."" https://t.co/xAEJ6JKyG5 — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) July 10, 2018 The embattled legal eagle seemed to preen about his career, asking Daniels whether she told the government that Avenatti was nice and respectful during the 11 months he represented her. “You lied to me,” Daniels blurted. “That isn’t respectful.” Avenatti then asked whether Daniels told The New York Times in a fawning 2018 profile of the lawyer that watching him work was like seeing Michelangelo paint the Sistine Chapel. “Yes, that’s what you told me to say,” Daniels testified. Before Avenatti wrapped up his questioning, he asked Daniels whether she was ultimately ordered to pay Trump $300,000 in attorney’s fees. He was referring to a failed defamation suit he filed on her behalf. “And you blame me for that?” Avenatti asked. “Yes,” she replied. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?
