12/31/2021,"The Canadian film-maker Jean-Marc Vallée, who has died aged 58, apparently of a heart attack, handled serious subjects with bounce and briskness, earning prizes and respect in the process. His film Dallas Buyers Club (2013), starring Matthew McConaughey as a rodeo rider who illegally imports retroviral drugs for himself and his fellow Aids patients in the mid-1980s, was directed with great clarity. McConaughey and his co-star Jared Leto, who played an HIV-positive transgender woman, won Oscars. Moments in the film that might have been heightened or underlined – such as a sexual encounter that qualifies as carefree only because both participants have already contracted Aids, or a fantasy scene in a room full of butterflies – were instead folded nonchalantly into the mix. “It really comes down to the fact that I just don’t want to show off in any way,” he said. “I love telling these stories that feel real, and authentic, so I try not to get too ‘Hollywood’ with it all when I am shooting. I just say, ‘Let’s get rid of this, go handheld, use natural light.’” The critic Anthony Lane called him “a film-maker of considerable cunning, who takes predicaments that should by rights deflate the heart … and turns them into nimble entertainments”.  He was equally successful in television. In 2017, he directed a starry cast (Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern) in the first series of Big Little Lies, a murder mystery set in an affluent community in Monterey, California. The show won multiple acting prizes, while Vallée took home a Primetime Emmy and a Directors Guild of America award. Citing his interest in “complicated, strongly etched female leads”, the DGA Quarterly called him “the George Cukor of our times”. He had previously worked with two members of the show’s cast on Wild (2014), in which Witherspoon played the writer Cheryl Strayed, for whom a 1,100-mile solo hike becomes a way of coping with and reflecting on her troubled past; Dern is seen in flashback as her late mother. Both women were Oscar-nominated. Vallée was born in Montreal, Canada; his father was a music programmer at the city’s radio stations. It was while studying business management at Collège Ahuntsic, Montreal, that Vallée took a film class for reasons of “pure laziness”, only to find the subject enthralling. He went on to study film at the University of Quebec, and directed music videos and several award-winning shorts after graduating. He made the thriller Black List (1995) before coming to Hollywood to direct the western Los Locos (1997). His international breakthrough came with C.R.A.Z.Y. (2005), a coming-out drama set in the 1960s and 70s. Having tried to get it off the ground for a decade, he was finally inspired to make it after seeing the British hit Billy Elliot. “I was frustrated with my films in the past,” he said. “I was having some kind of midlife crisis with my career and who I was … Seeing [Billy Elliot] really made me think that I’d better hurry up and make my film.” C.R.A.Z.Y. was curiously tentative about its hero’s sexuality, though Vallée’s use of music to express characterisation could not be faulted. He ploughed his entire fee, C$600,000 (£350,000) into securing rights to songs by David Bowie, Pink Floyd and others. Music shaped his approach to directing. He created playlists to help his actors get into character, and blasted out the Rolling Stones on the set of The Young Victoria (2009), scripted by the Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, co-produced by Sarah Ferguson and starring Emily Blunt as the youthful monarch. But his hopes of using songs by the Icelandic rock band Sigur Rós on the soundtrack were scuppered by the producers. “I lost creative control,” he said. “It’s not my cut. I would have done something different, mainly with the music.” He called the final score “traditional, classical, almost too cliched”. He had a happier time making Café de Flore (2011), which juxtaposes the travails of a celebrity DJ in latter-day Montreal with the story of a single mother raising a son with Down’s syndrome in late-60s Paris. Aside from C.R.A.Z.Y., it was the only one of his films on which he took a writing credit. He also directed Demolition (2015), starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a widower whose grief is expressed in a compulsion to destroy or dismantle his surroundings. Vallée went straight from Big Little Lies into another TV miniseries: Sharp Objects (2018), adapted from Gillian Flynn’s novel about a wayward reporter, played by Amy Adams, covering a murder story in her home town. Vallée, who had previously worked with Adams on an unmade Janis Joplin biopic, directed all eight episodes. The second series of Big Little Lies (2019), in which Meryl Streep joined the cast, was less rapturously received. It was also overshadowed by reports that material shot by its British director, Andrea Arnold, had been recut against her wishes by producers and editors, Vallée among them, to bring the series more in line with its predecessor. Vallée’s upcoming projects included a film about John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and an adaptation for television of Zack McDermott’s book Gorilla and the Bird: A Memoir of Madness and a Mother’s Love, about a lawyer who is admitted to a psychiatric hospital after suffering a breakdown. “I have a thing for underdogs, where they’ve got to put up a fight to find their happiness and to find themselves,” he said. “I guess I had to do it, too.” He is survived by his sons, Alex and Émile, from his marriage to the writer Chantal Cadieux; the couple divorced in 2006.

12/31/2021,"It was one of the most heartwarming images of the Tokyo Olympics. In the aftermath of the women’s BMX final, newly minted gold medallist Beth Shriever sat slumped on the track in front of a metal barrier, her legs splayed uselessly in front of her. She had pumped every last drop from them to see off the world No 1, Mariana Pajón, in a thrilling chase to the line. Now, they couldn’t even lift her to her feet. Within seconds, her GB teammate Kye Whyte was at her side. Whyte had taken silver in the men’s race that preceded Shriever’s, but you could see in his face what meant more to him. She mumbled something about not being able to feel her limbs. So he scooped her up in her arms, and they celebrated the moment together.  BMX is such a male-dominated affair in Britain that UK Sport initially withdrew its funding for female athletes after Rio, believing there wasn’t enough talent around to justify a programme. Just two days after Shriever won Britain’s first ever BMX gold, Charlotte Worthington secured its second in the women’s freestyle title. In her final routine, the 25-year-old became the first woman to land a 360 backflip in competition – she had been competing herself for only four years. Shriever says she hopes that their joint achievements have “proved our point”. “What Charlotte and I have done has made people realise there’s high potential for women to succeed in this sport,” she says. What’s interesting about the experiences of these two champions is that after their experiences outside the system – crowdfunding to cover travel expenses, working part-time as a teaching assistant and waitress respectively – Shriever and Worthington had spent the last couple of years training full-time with their male peers. The reason Kye Whyte was so excited for Shriever was that he had witnessed first-hand what she had put herself through. In 2021, sport seemed more open than ever to the notion of women training, performing and competing on the same stage as men. Mixed relay events made their debut at the Olympic Games in the pool and on the track. Cricket launched a new tournament that offered the same profile to its women’s and men’s teams. The trend is a promising one for gender equality, not least because it breaks the mould that has, for so long, cast women’s sports as an adjunct to men’s. The advantages of more gender-mixed environments have been many and instantaneous. Worthington says that in other circumstances, that famed 360 might never have been in her arsenal. “Performing tricks is so much about mental capability and confidence,” she says. “If I’d been training with women I might have been held back by what’s been achieved already – or rather, what had never been achieved.” Shriever, meanwhile, watched as the men around her learned a new attitude from the way she worked. “They’ve learned to treat and respect women a bit more. It creates a much more positive environment.” The staging of The Hundred, English cricket’s new domestic tournament, spread those happy outcomes even further. While plenty of fans had decried the need for more short-form cricket in the game’s already strained calendar, most of them agreed on one thing: it did wonders for the prestige, and the following, of the women’s game. In a counterintuitive piece of scheduling, The Hundred kicked off with a women’s fixture at The Oval which instantly broke both attendance and viewing figures, and records continued to be broken throughout its six-week run. The BBC’s prime-time coverage created a number of new stars among the young fanbase it was targeting – including the then 16-year-old Alice Capsey, who was still waiting for her GCSE results when she scored a half-century on debut. “That first game was daunting,” admits Capsey. “There were international players like Tash Farrant and Mady Villiers and Dane Niekerk all saying that was the best crowd they’d ever played in front of. I was a bit naive going into it, I’d only played a bit of county cricket – this was a completely new experience, not being able to hear what your teammate was saying 10 metres away!” Capsey ended up in playing every game, including the final against Southern Brave at Lord’s, where she contributed to Oval Invincibles’ victory with both bat and ball. She says there is huge anticipation among her fellow cricketers at the massive interest the Hundred has sparked in the women’s game. “Everyone’s really excited about how we’re going to build on it next year,” says Capsey. She hopes that in its next edition the men’s and women’s teams will be more closely integrated – “some teams like Southern Brave and Birmingham Phoenix were really big on combining the two sides, but Covid regulations made it more difficult.” For many, one of the most enjoyable features of the Hundred was itself a byproduct of Covid – the fact that most of the games were played as double-headers, ensuring unusually gender-mixed crowds in the stands. The family-friendly atmosphere was a good look for the sport, whose one-day and T20 matches can often evolve into rowdy, binge-laden affairs. Sports fans have long resigned themselves to the idea that antisocial behaviours are just the price you pay for a stadium atmosphere: here was proof that a change in tradition isn’t always a bad thing. Elsewhere, 2021 saw major sporting breakthroughs in a variety of traditionally masculine arenas. There are certain sports where the only thing that has ever prevented men and women competing on an equal footing has been male opposition to the idea. Darts is one of those – and in the Nordic Darts Masters, Fallon Sherrock finished runner-up to the legendary Michael van Gerwen, before becoming the first woman ever to reach the quarter-final of the Grand Slam of Darts in November. While Sherrock’s ceiling-smashing achievements made her the darling of the oche, jump racing was experiencing an even more seismic shock. At the Cheltenham Festival, Rachael Blackmore’s six winners – including the Champion Hurdle – led to her being named the leading jockey, the first woman ever to receive the title. But it was her pitch-perfect race on Minella Times in the Grand National that secured her the national spotlight, and an everlasting legacy. Only 20 women have ever competed in Aintree’s marquee race; half of their rides have come in the past decade. The speed with which they have proved themselves on equal terms is astonishing. Given the natural weight advantage and tradition of horsemanship that pertains to women, it is just as extraordinary that is has taken so long for horse racing to learn to value them. For Laura Collett, who won team eventing gold in Tokyo alongside Tom McEwen and Oliver Townend, the injustice is stark. “In equestrianism, gender has never been an issue: we’re all treated as completely equal and see ourselves that way. But in racing, which I’m very into, it’s only recently you’ve got the likes of Rachael, or Holly Doyle, being given the opportunity. Rachael sees herself just as a jockey, not a female jockey – that’s what it should be like. It makes me realise how lucky we are in our sport.” Within days of returning home from the Olympics, Collett, McEwen and Townend were back competing against each other in their regular events. And while mixed relay triathlon was a first for this year’s Olympics, teaming up was nothing new for its inaugural winners. “I’ve been doing mixed relays for a few years now and I’ve always loved it,” says Georgia Taylor-Brown, who took gold alongside Jess Learmonth, Jonny Brownlee and Alex Yee. “I was really aware that if we did well in the very first one at the Olympic Games we’d go down in the history books.” Their triumph was more than just another notch in GB’s medal tally: it fired the imagination of the watching public. For Taylor-Brown, it was an expression of the strong collegiate spirit that exists between Britain’s male and female triathletes. “We’re quite a small family – we’ll go to a world series race with only 10 or so athletes, so you’re all close and it’s very inclusive,” she says. “I’ll go out with the guys’ group ride, and Jess will swim with them in the pool because she’s probably quicker than a lot of the boys anyway.” Taylor-Brown thinks we’ll see more and more sports adopting a more mixed-gender approach in future. “Mixed genders adds an even better dynamic to the race because you don’t know what’s going to happen,” she says. “Just look at the swimming mixed relay, when GB were quite far behind after the first leg. All of a sudden Adam Peaty’s chasing down the women’s 100m breaststroke champion – it’s really dramatic, and tactically fascinating.”",Sport/Sport,"2021, the year of women in sport: Shriever and Capsey lead the way",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/30/2021-the-year-of-women-in-sport-shriever-and-capsey-lead-the-way
12/31/2021,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s lead defense attorney, Bobbi Sternheim, and members of her family vowed to appeal the five guilty verdicts on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges as they left court on Wednesday, but their efforts to clear her face considerable obstacles.  The challenges will probably center on judicial rulings during the defense presentation that prevented Maxwell’s lawyers from putting some witnesses on the stand anonymously, and another that prevented defense attorneys from recalling two of Maxwell’s accusers. “We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated,” Sternheim told reporters outside the court. To succeed in any appeal, the team would need to show that Judge Alison Nathan abused her discretion or violated rules of evidence. “It will be a difficult talk for the defense to win on appeal,” said New York appeals attorney Julie Rendelman. “Judge Nathan worked very hard to seat an impartial jury, and the defendant received a fair trial.” One area that Maxwell’s defense could try and use as grounds for appeal is whether the jury felt rushed in their deliberations after they were told they would have to work through New Years and pressure from the risk of Covid interrupting deliberations. “Did that play any role in their decision-making? At the same time, the jury was very expressive in their notes to the judge that they were taking the time they needed. The fact that they came back not guilty on one of the counts showed that they were taking the time to go through every piece of evidence,” Rendelman said. Another issue to be raised could be the role of compensation to Epstein’s victims. Ahead of the trial, for instance, Maxwell’s defense said they planned to call officials from the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund, which has awarded nearly $125m to about 150 individuals. The four witness against Maxwell received sums of up to $5m, and Maxwell’s defense had planned to introduce their statements to the fund to illuminate any inconsistencies in their testimony to the jury. But lawyers say that even if an appeals court agreed to hear the case, Maxwell’s lawyers would need to show that any violations were material to the trial’s outcome. A “harmless error” is not enough to overturn a conviction, Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School, told Reuters. Appeals lawyers could also argue as grounds for a challenge Nathan’s instruction to the jury that Maxwell could be found guilty even if she had deliberately ignored evidence of Epstein’s wrongdoing. Maxwell’s lawyers may also raise on appeal Nathan’s ruling preventing three defense witnesses from testifying anonymously. “There’s precedent when it comes to sexual crimes for witnesses to have their names removed, but there’s no precedent in the defense’s request to have their witnesses testify under a pseudonym, so I think Judge Nathan felt she had no choice but to rule them inadmissable,” Rendelman said.",News/US news,Maxwell’s attorney and family vow to appeal guilty verdict but face obstacles,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/ghislaine-maxwell-vow-appeal-guilty-verdict
