3/9/2022,"McDonald’s is temporarily closing its 850 restaurants in Russia and pausing all operations in the country, a decision that will affect 62,000 jobs, after mounting calls for action after the invasion of Ukraine. The burger chain said it would continue to pay the salaries for all employees in Russia and its charitable arm, Ronald McDonald House Charities, would also continue in the country. In a message to staff and franchisees, Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive of McDonald’s, said the situation was “extraordinarily challenging for a global brand like ours”, which he said worked with hundreds of local suppliers and partners producing its food. “We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners,” he said. But he added: “Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.” McDonald’s and other western food and drink companies including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have faced calls to pull out of Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. The film-maker and actor Sean Penn called on Americans to boycott the brand. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told CNN two days ago that “all western companies must withdraw from Russia” on humanitarian grounds. “We were upset to hear companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s remain in Russia and continue providing their products,” he said. McDonald’s, which has operated in Russia for more than 30 years, said it could not predict when it may be able to reopen its restaurants there and would “continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required”. It said it would “closely monitor the humanitarian situation” as well as disruption to its supply chain. McDonald’s is also paying full salaries to its Ukrainian employees and has donated $5m (£3.8m) to an assistance fund for employees as well as supporting relief efforts led by the International Red Cross. The McDonald’s shutdown comes after a host of other consumer brands including Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry, Ikea and Unilever, the owner of Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s, announced they had halted business in the country. Leading professional services firms including KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte have also cut off businesses in Russia and Belarus. Companies around the world have been scrambling to assess their links with Russia after the US, EU and UK sought to isolate it economically with sanctions. Sanctions have also made it illegal for US, EU or UK companies to serve some of the biggest Russian businesses, including banks such as Sberbank, Gazprombank and VTB.",News/World news,McDonald’s bows to pressure and closes all its Russian restaurants,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/mcdonalds-bows-to-pressure-and-closes-all-its-russian-restaurants
3/9/2022,"Joe Biden’s decision to ban imports of Russian oil increases the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin – but it is not without risk. On the face of it, the announcement from the White House looks like a bit of a free hit, given the fact that Russia accounts for just 7% of the oil imported by the world’s biggest economy. Three-fifths of Russia’s oil exports go to the EU, only 8% to the US. Even so, Biden is taking a gamble for three important reasons. The first is that a toughening up of sanctions has given another upward twist to oil prices. American motorists were already paying higher pump prices, even before the latest surge in the cost of Brent crude above $130 a barrel and, as the US president admitted, they will soon be paying even more. Oil prices are up by 70% since the start of the year and there is no sign of them coming down any time soon. The Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy has predicted a complete ban on Russian oil and gas could send crude prices to $200 a barrel. The previous milestone was the $147-a-barrel peak reached in 2008. The second risk is that Biden’s action fractures the western coalition against Putin, which in the first two weeks of the conflict has been solid. While support from the UK (phased in by the end of the year) means the US is not going it alone with its ban, other European countries clearly have misgivings. That is hardly surprising, because the EU gets 40% of its gas and just over a quarter of its oil from Russia. So when Biden said the west remained united in its determination to keep the pressure on Russia, that is not strictly true. The EU, as the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, made clear 24 hours before the US ban was announced, is worried about its energy security and has decided not to follow suit, for now at least. There is no risk of the lights going out in the US; the same could not be said of every country in Europe. This dependency on Russian energy creates a third risk, namely that Putin gets in his retaliation first by cutting off supplies. The EU has announced steps to reduce its dependency on Russian oil and gas, and the crisis could well have the effect of speeding up the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, but in the short term the loss of such a big chunk of its energy supply would result in weaker growth and higher inflation. While high energy prices eventually prove self-correcting because they tend to lead to recessions, the damage they can cause is considerable. UK living standards are on course for their biggest one-year fall since modern records began in the mid-1950s, with the war in Ukraine putting at risk the post-pandemic recovery. All of which makes it important that sanctions work quickly. The longer the economic war, the higher the cost.",News/Business,How the US Russian oil ban risks splitting the west’s response,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/how-the-us-russian-oil-ban-risks-splitting-the-wests-response
3/9/2022,"The only straightforward part of Shell’s announcement of its intention “to withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons” was the grovelling apology for buying a shipload of Russian oil in the rapid-delivery “spot” market last week. And an apology from chief executive Ben van Beurden was obviously necessary: the company’s huge Rotterdam refinery may have been running low on supplies, but the obligation was to pay through the nose to secure alternative barrels from west Africa or somewhere. Shell will now cease spot purchases from Russia immediately. Good. The rest of the carefully worded statement, however, was a reminder that Europe’s effort to wean itself off Russian oil and gas is an exercise in how much disruption European governments and consumers are prepared to bear, and how soon. Shell’s disentanglement plan came with two important qualifications. It will be conducted “in a phased manner” and will be “aligned with new government guidance”. In other words, in the absence of formal EU sanctions, it’s up to European governments to tell Shell, and by implication, all oil majors how quickly to disentangle. The company’s timetable imagines “weeks” to remove Russian oil from the European system and “much longer” to withdraw petroleum products (meaning petrol, diesel, heating oil and so on) plus gas in both pipeline and liquefied form. It’s vague on detail, but so is the EU’s own hugely ambitious plan to reduce Russian gas imports by two-thirds before the end of the year. Nothing concentrates minds like a crisis, but the EU is attempting to do in 10 months what would previously have been assumed to take a decade or more. Renewables will be accelerated “at lightning speed”; new sources of liquefied gas will be secured; hydrogen production will be ramped up; state-aid rules will be rewritten. Aside from the extra use of dirty coal, one can only applaud the EU’s determination. By comparison, the UK’s parallel effort to phase out the import of Russian oil and oil products by the end of this year (and liquefied gas at some point) looks straightforward given our starting point of much lower direct dependency on Russia. But it is only realistic to warn that consumers cannot expect a smooth ride. An entire European energy framework that has developed over the past 50 years is being redesigned at breakneck speed. Disruption seems inevitable. There was a hint of what’s to come in Shell’s reference to likely “reduced throughput at some of our refineries”, which translates as a warning of possible shortages on forecourts. At the moment, the messaging to western European consumers has barely risen above the level of gentle hints to please turn down the thermostat. We’re surely going to have to go further on the demand side. In the oil shock of the 1970s, speed limits on roads were lowered to reduce consumption. It may not come to that this time, but, one way or another, a chunk of demand has to be removed. Voluntary measures when oil is at $126 a barrel are easier than enforced ones at $200. Betting everything on the EU’s rapid reinvention of its supply infrastructure is quite a gamble. Mind you, the gyrations in energy markets have nothing on the wild goings-on with metals. Nickel doubled in price on Tuesday to a record $100,000 a tonne, forcing the London Metal Exchange to halt trading on “orderly market grounds”. It’s an old-fashioned tale of a savage squeeze on short-sellers, given extra impetus on this occasion by big trading houses’ self-sanctioning stances towards Russian purchases. China Construction Bank was allowed more time to put up extra collateral on behalf of a Chinese stainless steel billionaire who was caught on the wrong side of the action. Both the state-owned bank and the client will cope, one suspects, but one moral of that story is that some enormous profits and losses will have been made in the past fortnight of turmoil in everything commodity-related. Aside from operating companies hedging their input costs, hedge funds also fish in these waters. On past form, there will be casualties.",News/Business,Pulling the plug on Russian oil and gas won’t be a smooth ride for consumers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/08/pulling-the-plug-on-russian-oil-and-gas-wont-be-a-smooth-ride-for-consumers
3/9/2022,"Even on the night Real Madrid may have wrapped up La Liga, it was all about Europe. On Saturday, the day Paris Saint-Germain were losing 1-0 at Nice, Carlo Ancelotti’s team produced possibly their best performance of the season. Coming from a goal down, they defeated Real Sociedad 4-1 at a noisy Santiago Bernabéu where well after the final whistle the players came back out to greet their fans and a defiant chant went round, a message of hope. “Sí, se puede!” it ran. “Yes, we can!” They weren’t talking about being able to win the league. Having just pulled eight points clear of Sevilla – a lead never overturned at this stage of the season – that seems likely now. Instead, they were talking about being able to turn round the 1-0 deficit from the first leg against PSG. This, after all is the competition that truly measures them and obsesses the 13-times winners of the European Cup. It is the competition that obsesses PSG too of course, the only one that truly appears to matter for a club at the opposite end of the European scale when it comes to trophies. “The Champions League is special, you’re motivated even more and I want to produce a great game, make history and take Paris where they should be,” Neymar said here in Madrid. “What we most want is the Champions League. The excitement and hope will always be there with the Champions League.” If the “unlike Ligue 1”, still less the French Cup, went without saying it was pretty explicit there and also in the words of Mauricio Pochettino, who insisted that “the Cup, the league, and the Champions League are different challenges”. It was even more explicit when the PSG coach added: “Neymar was signed a few years ago to try to win the Champions League: that was said in every press conference and at his presentation.” And that’s before you get on to Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé. For that to happen PSG must progress here. Neymar is back to help and they lead, which is the good news, as is the fact that they were so dominant at the Parc des Princes. And yet the feeling has shifted, that sense of superiority diminishing and something else building in its place. The conditions have been created for a comeback. “We have to adapt and read what has changed in three weeks,” Pochettino said. “As soon as the game was over the machinery started, those around Madrid and the club started to generate positive feelings, the idea that the comeback is possible,” he added, comparing that with the negativity and pessimism he believes surrounds his club. At one point he noted that he replies to some questions out of “good manners”, the line “I have been patient with you” serving instead to highlight that patience is something he is running out of. “We do know that if we lose there are no more Champions League games,” he said. Perhaps that is the pressure talking, the need to finally win this competition. For Madrid, it is the opposite: even in defeat, they are not defeated, history teaching them there is a way back and offering a lesson they cling to. The idea of a European comeback is built into their identity, as much a story as a statistical reality. Pochettino, though, may have overplayed it and there was a negative spin put on it too when Ancelotti was asked who had more at stake if they lost – him or his players. The first-leg performance was so bad that the initial reaction was not optimistic, consolation found only in it being a single year – next season Mbappé would be theirs. Concern was deepened by two key suspensions too: Ferland Mendy and Casemiro. Toni Kroos is a doubt, with Ancelotti saying: “If he’s 95% fit, he doesn’t play.” “Casemiro is the best there is in his position and Madrid will miss him; for us, obviously it is better he doesn’t play,” Neymar admitted, laughing. As for PSG’s key injury doubt, Pochettino and Neymar said they expected Mbappé to play after he limped out of training on Monday. For all that Pochettino saw Madrid’s wheels clicking into gear, it wasn’t until Saturday that the attitude finally shifted fully. Twenty days without midweek fixtures have helped, allowing for better preparation and fitness, Karim Benzema’s return has too, and there is a solidity about them that was not there before. But it took the Real Sociedad win to really feel ready for this meeting. “After this, Madridismo believes more in the comeback than before,” Ancelotti said on Saturday. “The reception from the fans was nice because their help will be vital.” A call has already gone out for them to gather at 7pm to welcome the team bus, Luka Modric insisting: “The Bernabéu can play an important role.” Madrid’s manager, though, was trying to avoid falling into the trap of making an epic of what will be a special evening no matter what. For all PSG’s dominance, it is only 1-0: for Madrid, that was the best news of all to come out of Paris. “There are lots of key factors in a game like this; the mental aspect is very important,” Ancelotti said. “The team is in a good shape, motivated, calm. We have to be intelligent. We can’t go mad because we have to win the game, not score loads of goals. Maybe we score early or in the last minute; the important thing is to be alive.”",Sport/Football,Real Madrid rediscover their belief as Neymar and PSG set sights on history  | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/real-madrid-rediscover-their-belief-as-neymar-and-psg-set-sights-on-history
3/9/2022,"John Bercow should never again hold public office or a position of leadership, a former Black Rod has said, as the former Speaker was found to have repeatedly lied and to have bullied staff during his tenure in the House of Commons. Lt Gen David Leakey, who made one of the complaints against Bercow and acted as a witness to others, told the Guardian he had been determined to ensure Bercow’s record was examined fully. Leakey said no public institution should give Bercow a position while he refused to show any contrition for his behaviour. Bercow, who joined the Labour party after leaving parliament, was reported to be considering a run for London mayor after Sadiq Khan’s term is over. Labour has since suspended him from the party. He is chancellor of the University of Essex, as well as professor of politics at Royal Holloway. A spokesperson for Bercow said on Tuesday he had “never sought or wanted” to be London mayor. The independent panel that examined parliament’s standards commissioner’s findings concluded that at least 21 complaints against him could be upheld. It banned him from holding a parliamentary pass and said he could have been expelled from the Commons if still an MP. The panel, chaired by the former appeal court judge Sir Stephen Irwin, said: “The findings of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which we have upheld, show that the respondent has been a serial bully. His evidence in the investigations, the findings of the commissioner, and his submissions to us, show also that the respondent has been a serial liar.” Complainants described Bercow’s “amazing display of temper”, including claims of mimicking, shouting, swearing, public humiliation and smashing a mobile phone while throwing it at a senior staffer. Bercow said the complaints were from staffers who had resisted his modernisation efforts. “To describe what I have experienced as a kangaroo court is grossly insulting to kangaroos,” he said. Leakey said: “People can redeem themselves and I hope John Bercow does redeem himself. But so far as I am aware, he has never ever said one word of contrition to anyone. He never put in place a process to deal with bullying when he had an opportunity to do so. In my view, that disqualifies him from a role anywhere in public life or in any position of leadership or governance. He is uniquely disqualified.” Leakey’s own complaint against Bercow was not upheld and he conceded there were no third party witnesses, but he gave detailed witness testimony of Bercow’s bullying of other staff to the inquiry. “I would never have taken him through the complaints procedure from my own personal point of view because I couldn’t have cared less about his bullying to me personally,” Leakey said. “I had to think very carefully about doing it while I was Black Rod – it would have been written up as the Queen’s representative taking on Bercow.” He said he had been aware of three people – Angus Sinclair, Kate Emms and Lord Lisvane – who had been treated far worse. Multiple complaints by the three were eventually upheld. “I thought that I would make it very public that I was doing it to try and encourage others who had been bullied to do similar because otherwise he and people like him, was simply going to go on getting away with mistreating staff and other colleagues,” he said. Bercow said the process had been unfair, describing it as “feeble conclusions reached [that] would be torn to shreds in any judicial process”. Leakey said the former Speaker could not complain about a system he had helped to enforce. “He will rail about how unfair or unjust it has been. But he was the Speaker in the House of Commons for 11 years,” he said. “He chaired the House of Commons commission. There were endless reports about bullying. If the process that is in place is a defective one in his view now, then he had 11 years of his own failure to put a proper process in place to blame for that.”",News/Politics,"Bercow should be barred from public office, says former Black Rod",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/john-bercow-should-never-again-hold-public-office-former-black-rod
3/9/2022,"Any outbreak of peace between Phil Mickelson and the PGA Tour will need to be instigated by the player. Jay Monahan, the Tour’s commissioner, stated that “the ball is in his court” after Mickelson’s comments about a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league. Mickelson is in the midst of a break from golf at his own behest but Monahan did not dismiss the idea of suspension for the six-time major winner. “He has said that he’s stepping away and he wants time for reflection,” said Monahan. “That’s something that I and we are going to respect and honour. When he’s ready to come back to the PGA Tour, we’re going to have that conversation. That’s a conversation I look forward to. “I have not talked to Phil since he made his comments and since he said that he was stepping away. I think the ball is in his court. I would welcome a phone call from him. But it’s hard for me to talk about the different scenarios that could play out.” A key intrigue surrounds whether Mickelson will end his break from the game at next month’s Masters, an event he has won three times. The Tour never reveal details of player sanctions. Still, it was notable that Monahan refused to confirm whether Mickelson would have been welcome to feature in this week’s Players Championship had he chosen to do so. “He stepped away on his own accord and he asked for time,” the commissioner added. “He’s been given that time. We don’t comment on disciplinary matters, potential matters or actual matters. But every player is accountable for their actions out here.” Before Monahan spoke, Rory McIlroy had publicly called for the Tour to change their approach about players who breach the rules. “I think transparency and maybe it not being as closed a shop,” said McIlroy of what the Tour should look to improve. “I’ve always felt that a few of the bans or suspensions, I think that should all be announced. I think that should be more transparent. I’ve always said that.” Monahan had opened his traditional pre-Players address with a swipe at Mickelson. “We are and we always will be focused on legacy, not leverage,” he said. The precise status of the Saudi plan, fronted by Greg Norman, remains unclear after umpteen of the best players in the world stated a commitment to the PGA Tour. “We are in a position where no one can compete with what we have,” Monahan insisted. “The PGA Tour is moving on. We have too much momentum and too much to accomplish to be consistently distracted by rumours of other golf leagues and their attempts to disrupt our players, our partners, and most importantly our fans from enjoying the Tour and the game we all love so much.” It has been confirmed Tiger Woods’s 14-year-old daughter, Sam, will introduce her father when he is inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Wednesday. Woods remains confident of competing again despite serious injuries sustained in a car crash early last year. “It feels like my career is not over yet,” Woods said.",Sport/Sport,PGA Tour chief says Phil Mickelson has ‘ball in his court’ in breakaway feud,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/pga-tour-chief-says-phil-mickelson-has-ball-in-his-court-in-league-feud
3/9/2022,"Nicola Sturgeon has issued a posthumous apology to the thousands of people persecuted as witches in Scotland, underlining that the deep misogyny that motivated this “colossal” injustice is something women today still have to live with. As she responded to a petition demanding a pardon for the more than 4,000 people in Scotland – the vast majority of them women – who were accused, convicted and often executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1563, the first minister told the Scottish parliament that she was acknowledging “that egregious historic injustice” and extending a formal posthumous apology to all those who were so vilified. Speaking during the Scottish government’s debate on International Women’s Day, Sturgeon explained: “Those who met this fate were not witches, they were people, and they were overwhelmingly women. “At a time when women were not even allowed to speak as witnesses in a courtroom, they were accused and killed because they were poor, different, vulnerable or in many cases just because they were women.” According to the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, a comprehensive database of known prosecutions, between the first execution in 1479 and the last in 1727, at least 2,500 people were killed. The moral panic around witchcraft and devil worship that convulsed post-Reformation societies across Europe and colonial America was especially fierce in Scotland, which carried out five times the European average of executions per capita. Sturgeon described this as “injustice on a colossal scale, driven at least in part by misogyny in its most literal sense: hatred of women”. Over the past few years, there have been growing calls for a national monument to commemorate those who died as well as a formal apology for their persecution, and campaigners on Tuesday welcomed “the first formal recognition of this terrible miscarriage of justice”. Sturgeon told MSPs there were three reasons why this generation should say sorry for events that took places centuries ago. “Firstly, acknowledging injustice, no matter how historic is important. This parliament has issued, rightly so, formal apologies and pardons for the more recent historic injustices suffered by gay men and by miners. “Second, for some, this is not yet historic. There are parts of our world where even today, women and girls face persecution and sometimes death because they have been accused of witchcraft. “And thirdly, fundamentally, while here in Scotland the Witchcraft Act may have been consigned to history a long time ago, the deep misogyny that motivated it has not. We live with that still. Today it expresses itself not in claims of witchcraft, but in everyday harassment, online rape threats and sexual violence.” BREAKING NEWS The First @NicolaSturgeon just issued a formal apology to those people, mostly women, convicted under the Witchcraft Act on #InternationalWomensDay2022 .This is the first formal recognition of this terrible miscarriage of justice @zoevenditozzi @madisonmitchel1 Modern misogyny, intensified by an increasingly polarised public discourse and amplified by social media, had a significant impact on women now questioning whether politics and public life are safe environments for them, Sturgeon added.Sturgeon also welcomed in principle the recommendations made by Helena Kennedy’s working group on misogynist abuse, published on Tuesday morning, stating her government would respond formally as soon as possible. She added: “This report matters beyond the detail of the specific recommendations it makes. It matters because it acknowledges and it gives powerful voice to the stark realities of everyday life for women. “It recognises that misogyny is endemic, and that it blights the lives of women every single day.”",News/UK news,Nicola Sturgeon issues apology for ‘historical injustice’ of witch hunts,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/nicola-sturgeon-issues-apology-for-historical-injustice-of-witch-hunts
3/9/2022,"Can China play peacemaker? That is the faint hope now being seized upon by western leaders desperate to end the bloodshed in Ukraine. “It has to be China,” said Josep Borrell, the UN foreign policy chief. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said that “China is interested in stopping this war”. On Tuesday, Xi Jinping made his strongest statement on the war yet as the French president and German chancellor met him virtually, calling for “maximum restraint” and saying that China was “pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe”. What he did not do was call it an invasion or blame Russia. The bilateral relationship is at its closest for seven decades, since the Sino-Soviet split. Weeks before the invasion, the two presidents declared that it had “no limits” as Vladimir Putin visited Beijing for the Winter Olympics – the only major leader to do so amid a western diplomatic boycott. China has denounced reports that it asked Russia not to invade during the Games as US disinformation. Even if Mr Xi knew that his counterpart planned a full-scale invasion across Ukraine, he surely failed to anticipate the strength of resistance and the scale of the international backlash. But his personal investment in the partnership makes it extremely hard to correct course. European attempts to position China as a mediator reflect the lack of other options, but also the understanding that it is attempting to reconcile three irreconcilable elements: its closeness to Russia; its long-declared belief in territorial integrity, national sovereignty and non-interference; and its need to minimise the fallout it experiences from the sanctions on Moscow. This, rather than fundamental shifts in its position, explains confused messaging since 24 February, and China’s decision to abstain rather than vote with Russia on key UN resolutions. The bilateral relationship is one of convenience, not love. The countries have been adversaries as well as partners in the past. Mr Xi and Mr Putin are alike in pursuing repression at home and a more aggressive policy abroad, and buttressing their regimes with a narrative of their nation’s historical greatness. Above all, they are brought together by their belief that the US – and the west more broadly – is the major threat that they face. China may not have welcomed the invasion – but it has repeatedly blamed the US and Nato encroachment for the crisis, described Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy as an attempt to create a regional version of Nato, and denounced “illegal” sanctions on Russia. The foreign ministry has amplified ludicrous claims made in Moscow’s disinformation campaign. Mr Xi no doubt appreciates that Mr Putin has dragged the Biden administration’s attention away from dealing with China. The new closeness between the US and Europe – including central and eastern European countries that China has been carefully courting – is less welcome. Sino-Russian trade has grown substantially; last year it jumped to a record $146.9bn (£111.9bn). But that is only around half the level of China’s trade with the EU, and a fraction of its trade with the US. It trails strategic objectives. Vaguely expressed hopes for de-escalation are very different to actions to help achieve it. The suspicion is that remarks suggesting Beijing is open to mediation are designed to soften criticism of its support for Russia, rather than reflecting a shift in its thinking. That at least shows that it knows that it too will pay a price for the invasion, economically and politically – a point that European leaders should reiterate. Though expectations of its ability and willingness to act as go-between should be low, pressing China may dissuade it from doing more to assist Russia, and impose limits on a friendship that is supposed to be without them.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on China and Russia: enough in common | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-russia-enough-in-common
3/9/2022,"There is no data on global plastic pollution that is equivalent to the regular measurements of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere. But as with greenhouse gases, the recent news has been nearly all bad. In 1950, worldwide production of plastics stood at 2m tons per year. In 2020, it was 367m tons (down from 368m the year before due to the coronavirus pandemic). An increase this enormous is hard to visualise. But the 8.8m tons of plastic waste that is estimated to enter the world’s marine environment each year is the equivalent of a rubbish truck filled with plastic being tipped into the sea every minute. So the agreement struck by 173 countries at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi last week was a huge relief. At last, something is going to be done multilaterally about a problem that no government can solve on its own. Without the legally binding treaty that will be negotiated over the next two years, it was hard to see where progress would come from. The announcement was only the beginning of a long and fraught process. The pollution and destruction of nature are material phenomena. As with cutting emissions (or failing to), fine words about plastics are no use unless they are accompanied by strong actions, including mechanisms to ensure reductions in consumption. Plastic pollution is closely linked to economic growth, and changing our way of life will not be simple. But as a statement of intent, and proof that multilateral cooperation to protect our shared environment is still possible, the agreement is more than welcome. Like global heating, plastic pollution is a matter of social justice issue as well as conservation, with people in poor countries suffering disproportionately. As with emissions, the richest countries and companies are the worst culprits. Research for the US federal government last year found that Americans now generate about 42m tonnes of plastic waste a year – more than all European Union member countries combined. Another report found that 20 companies are responsible for producing 55% of the world’s plastic waste. Some are the same companies responsible for fossil fuel production, since plastics are made from petrochemicals. Efforts to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and television footage of plastic waste in an albatross’s nest, have imprinted themselves on public consciousness in countries where these reports have been widely seen. But policymakers’ efforts to tackle the plastic problem have been limited to waste management, including the bans on plastic waste imports imposed by China and other countries, and restrictions in many countries on the sale of single-use plastic items such as bags. Such measures can have localised effects, and influence attitudes and behaviour. But they have not touched the source of the problem: the total amount of plastic waste in the world is predicted to almost quadruple by 2050 and the oil industry is heavily invested in expansion, partly as a means of coping with reduced demand in other areas, as people switch to greener technologies. This has to change. In the words of oceans campaigner Christina Dixon, the “plastics tap must be turned off”.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on plastics: a treaty could stem the tide | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/the-guardian-view-on-plastics-a-treaty-could-stem-the-tide
3/9/2022,"A family have spoken of their joy after a judge ruled that an autistic teenage boy with a rare kidney disease should be allowed a transplant, against the judgment of doctors. William Verden, 17, is being kept alive by dialysis at Manchester Children’s Hospital but it will stop working in 12 months at the most. Health officials took the medical decision that William should not be offered the chance to have a kidney transplant. That led to his family launching a legal case and an appeal for possible donors to come forward after tests showed relatives would not be suitable. William’s mother, Amy McLennan, of Lancaster, had accused the NHS of handing her son a “death sentence”. At a court hearing in Liverpool on Tuesday, Mrs Justice Arbuthnot ruled that a transplant was in the boy’s best interests. “Transplant is not futile,” she said. “Although the chances of that lead to an increase in William’s suffering in the short and medium term, it has the commensurate benefit which is there is a chance for William of long-term survival.” William’s mother said going to court was not something she ever wanted. “As a family we still struggle to comprehend why William’s case has gotten to this stage but this judgment is about trying to look to the future. “What’s happened is in the past and we now need to focus on trying to find the crucial donor who can provide William with the best chance in life.” McLennan said all she ever wanted was for William to be added to the transplant list and have his treatment continued until a donor was found. “I feel it is the minimum he deserves and what any mum would do for their child.” The family’s lawyer, Liz Davis, of the firm Irwin Mitchell, said it was an “incredibly sensitive case which has prompted a really important discussion not only about William’s care but also about the wider issue of providing medical treatment to people with autism and learning disabilities”. Davis said listening to the evidence in court had been tough for the family. “Strong legal arguments were put forward as to what is in William’s best interests. We’re pleased that the judge has ruled in William’s favour and understandably Amy and the family are overjoyed.” William, who is autistic and has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, suffers from steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The court heard evidence that there was a 50% chance of success. But William’s doctors argued the chance of disease recurrence after a transplant would be nearer 100%. The hearing was told doctors could not agree to a transplant because William would suffer psychological and physical harm from post-operation sedation and ventilation to prevent him pulling out lines and catheters. It was also argued that if a transplant proved successful then William would live a further 15 to 20 years before he needed another one. Because both parties were in disagreement Manchester University NHS foundation trust brought the case to ask a judge to rule on the matter. The trust has been approached for comment. William’s case was heard by the court of protection which considers cases relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions. A number of people have come forward wanting to help after the family launched an appeal for possible donors.",News/Society,Judge says autistic teenage boy with rare kidney disease can seek transplant,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/08/judge-says-autistic-teenage-boy-with-rare-kidney-disease-can-seek-transplant
3/9/2022,"The Duchess of Cornwall came face to face with the actor who played her younger self in The Crown at an event to mark International Women’s Day. The event, a reception at Clarence House, was hosted by Camilla and was attended by a range of women leading in fields such as the arts, politics and business for International Women’s Day. Emerald Fennell, who portrayed her in the Netflix series, was among those in attendance. The Duchess of Cornwall and Fennell were seen to be in conversation for a few minutes, but when Fennell was asked about what the conversation involved, she said: “You know what – I’m going to be very discreet, because if I’ve learned anything it’s ‘loose lips sink ships’.” The Duchess of Cornwall’s speech, which called on women to “share their stories” in order to bring about a more equal world, addressed Fennell directly. “It is reassuring to know that, if I should fall off my perch at any moment, my fictional alter ego is here to take over,” the Duchess said to laughter from the audience. “So, Emerald, be prepared!” Fennell said their meeting was “absolutely delightful”. “She is such an impressive person, it was fittingly nice to meet her today on International Women’s Day because she does so much for so many particularly female-centred charities,” Fennell said. “She’s been in the spotlight for a long time and has always weathered it with a lot of grace and good humour.” She added: “I was nervous I might be thrown in the tower but so far so good.” The event, which marked International Women’s Day, also featured a moving speech by Inna Prystaiko, the wife of the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, in which she spoke about the experience of women during the invasion. While holding back tears, Prystaiko said: “Today there are no smiles and no peace, just horror and sorrow in the eyes of every Ukrainian woman, mother and wife.” She added: “Now we have to count the death toll of our people and watch their frightened, crying children who are forced to flee their native land with their mothers and sisters, leaving their fathers to defend our country.” The Crown has previously faced controversy regarding whether the show was historically accurate, with the former culture secretary Oliver Dowden urging the company to add a disclaimer that the show was fiction. Netflix responded that they had no intention of doing so.",News/World news,Camilla meets actor who played her younger self in The Crown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/camilla-meets-actor-who-played-her-younger-self-in-the-crown
3/9/2022,"A group of independent investigators have called for the reinvestigation of the sudden deaths of 14 Indigenous people in a north Ontario city, after finding that the original inquiries were hampered by sloppy police work and a legacy of institutional racism. The team have examined hundreds of deaths between 2003 and 2017 in Thunder Bay, the largest city in the northern reaches of the province – and one where the police force has long faced allegations of racism within its ranks. In 2016, one of the largest inquests in Ontario history concluded that Indigenous people in the region were overpoliced but crimes against them were underinvestigated. Two years later, a landmark report by Murray Sinclair – a former senator and one of the country’s first Indigenous judges – found significant flaws in investigations into the deaths of nine Indigenous people, as well as a “clear and indisputable pattern” of racism in the Thunder Bay police force. Following Sinclair’s report, the city’s police board was dissolved. As part of that report, a team of independent investigators was assembled to scour additional historical cases. Last week, the investigative team submitted its findings to Ontario’s ministry of the attorney general and the office of the independent police review director. The report has not yet been made public, but the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) and the Globe and Mail were able to view the report ahead of its public release. Of the 14 sudden deaths highlighted in an upcoming report, 10 were women and the ages ranged from two months old to 61 years old. In the cases flagged by the investigative team, documentation was often missing or incomplete. Police investigations were inconsistent and deviated from standards. The investigative team also found cases where coroners failed to attend the scene of a death or even order a postmortem to determine a cause of death. The report determined that pathologists and police were “making premature comments on no foul play and releasing scenes” before a postmortem exam could be done in cases of suspicious deaths. In one case from 2010, a 42-year-old woman was found dead from a possible hanging. Police failed to interview any possible witnesses or obtain video from the hotel where she was staying with her boyfriend. It was later determined the boyfriend had previous convictions for multiple assaults. He was never interrogated by police before he died in 2017. In another case, a two-month-old baby boy was found unresponsive in an apartment and pronounced dead at a hospital. The report found that police were aware of previous abuse allegations against the parents involving another child in the home. Investigators said the cause and manner of death of the two-month-old was undetermined, but if evidence had been properly collected, the death would probably have been investigated as possible criminal negligence causing death. A second report, which will not be made public, identified 25 unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. The investigative team has called for external review of those cases.",News/World news,New investigations needed in 14 Indigenous deaths in Ontario,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/canada-14-indigenous-deaths-ontario-new-investigations
