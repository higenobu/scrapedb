12/30/2021,"The most prominent pro-democracy media outlet still operating in Hong Kong, Stand News, said it will shut down after police raided its offices, froze its assets and arrested senior journalists and former board members including pop star Denise Ho. Authorities deployed an anti-sedition law in their crackdown that was drawn up under British colonial rule and had not been used for decades. A senior police officer accused the online site of “inciting hatred” against the Hong Kong government in news articles and interviews.  Activists warned this approach could be used to criminalise almost any critical reporting on the Hong Kong government, and the UN and media watchdogs CPJ and RSF condemned the crackdown as an attack on press freedom. The shuttering of Stand News came just months after a similar raid and asset freeze forced the closure of popular pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, which was owned by now-jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai. Afterwards, in an apparent effort to protect its future, Stand News took down most of its commentary section and halted donations. The board members also stepped down, but none of those moves were enough to stave off a legal case. In a sign of Hong Kong authorities’ confidence, those detained early on Wednesday morning include the singer Ho, who is also a Canadian citizen, prominent barrister Margaret Ng and longstanding members of the city’s elite. Police also searched the home of news editor Ronson Chan, who is head of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. He said they released him without charge, but took his phone, computer and other electronic devices. “Because of the situation, Stand News is now stopping operations,” the online publication said in a Facebook post. “Acting editor in chief, Patrick Lam, has resigned and all Stand News employees are dismissed.” Hong Kong was promised free speech in the handover agreement from British colonial rule in 1997, among other rights enshrined as part of its semi-autonomous status, and until two years ago it had a thriving media operating in both English and Cantonese. The passage of the new National Security Law for the city in June 2020 brought that era to an abrupt end, and the closure of the Apple Daily, perhaps the biggest media thorn in the pro-Beijing authorities’ side, followed within a year. There is little question that room for journalists will shrink further. The furiously nationalist Chinese tabloid Global Times said in the wake of Stand News closure that “legal experts” had warned other media outlets to curb their output. “They shall not expect any privileges or abuse the freedom of speech in endangering the national security, neither do foreign journalists,” the paper said on Twitter. Stand News reports that police officers from the national security department arrived at the home of its news editor, Ronson Chan, in the early hours of the morning, saying they are investigating a case of conspiracy to distribute seditious publications. pic.twitter.com/YH11Y6CWix In the summer, Hong Kong’s police chief called for a “fake news” law to tackle “hostility against the police”. His desire for powers to muzzle unfavourable reporting was widely seen as pointing to a possible next phase of the crackdown on free speech. Video from the scene of the raid on Stand News, whose reporters said they were barred from filming police operations themselves, showed officers taking boxes away. They later confirmed HK $61m (£6m) of Stand News assets had been frozen, the largest such amount targeted under the national security law. Police Sr Supt Steve Li said the outlet had published articles that incited hatred and made unfounded accusations, and cited its interviews with people who advocated for Hong Kong independence. He said police were also investigating whether a UK bureau set up this year represented “collusion with foreign forces”. Stand News was founded in the wake of the 2014 student-led Umbrella movement, successor to another pro-democracy website, House News, and was highly respected both in the city and beyond. It was nominated in the “independence” category at the Reporters Without Borders press freedom awards in November, and was the only Hong Kong media outlet to work with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists to produce reports on the Pandora Papers in October 2021. Its closure was a further blow to an opposition movement already reeling from the effective end of multiparty politics in Hong Kong’s legislature, curbs on academia and even a reshaping of the city landscape to remove monuments critical of Beijing. “Outrageous. After the fall of the Apple Daily, StandNewsHK is the largest prodemocracy media that exists in HK,” pro-democracy activist in exile Sunny Cheung tweeted. “Beijing is eradicating all room of the opposition.” The crackdown is not only affecting Hong Kong’s media. A survey conducted by the city’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club last month found almost half of 100 surveyed reporters had made plans to leave or were considering an exit. RSF’s east Asia bureau chief, Cédric Alviani, told Reuters the raids and arrests aimed to “bring Hong Kong down to the level of repression and censorship that is equivalent to mainland China”. “When you arrest a team of journalists from a media outlet with a reputation for independence, no one can say it’s for another purpose other than to try and muzzle the media and try to control the narrative on the territory.”",News/World news,Hong Kong media outlet Stand News to close after police raid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/hong-kong-police-arrest-six-journalists-from-independent-media-outlet-stand-news
