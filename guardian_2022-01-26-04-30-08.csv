1/26/2022,"Towards the end of Sunday’s second T20 against West Indies at Bridgetown, Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood, England’s captain and coach, one on the pitch and another on the bench, endured a similar experience: balls being pummelled high over their heads and lightbulbs going off in them. As New Zealand demonstrated in the T20 World Cup semi-final in November and West Indies re-emphasised, when from a near-impossible position they flayed the bowling to such an extent that they ended up losing by one run, England’s death bowling is an issue, and one to which they have themselves contributed. Morgan has deliberately sheltered his side from the pressures of defending a total, having not chosen to bat first since September 2016. But on Tuesday Collingwood said that approach has now changed.  “We need to improve our death bowling and death bowling really only gets tested under serious pressure when you’re bowling second and you’re trying to defend a total,” he said. “In the last four or five years, whenever we’ve won the toss we’ve batted second and we’re very good at that. [But] if you’re going into World Cups, you’ve got to make sure you’ve got all bases covered. “You’ve got that balance as coaches, as players, of you want to win games of cricket – and you’ve also got the pressure of supporters wanting you to win games. The one thing about Eoin Morgan is he’s willing to lose games to better the side and have those experiences. It was evident in that World Cup semi-final it was an area we really hadn’t been pressed on too much. “Playing [last summer] against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, we probably had one instance when we were under serious pressure with that. So if we can put ourselves in those positions it’s going to be better for us later in the year. “The simple thing is we’ve got to make sure we put these guys under the pump. If you can win along the way then it’s a huge bonus, but the most important thing is you get them into these situations.” With so many of the World Cup squad absent here because of their subsequent involvement in the Ashes, the only player to bowl at the crucial moments of both matches is Chris Jordan, whose final over twice cost 23. “CJ gives you a lot in other parts of the game,” Collingwood said. “He’s the perfect kind of T20 cricketer. But that death bowling is something we need to improve. If we get it right this is a very formidable side.” More positively, Jordan is unexpectedly basking in the position of being the leading run-scorer with 55 while Adil Rashid has faced 21 balls, more than in 35 matches in the past three years combined. “CJ and Rash have been put under scenarios where they’ve got to go out and face more balls than three, which is usually what they get a chance to do,” Collingwood said. “That’s another learning moving forward, having the confidence that these guys can come in and have good strike-rates at the back end.” Having used 12 players in the first two games Collingwood promised “there will be changes” for Wednesday’s match. One of those could be Liam Livingstone, who is close to recovering from oesophagitis – the painful inflammation of the lower throat – and having trained on Tuesday should be available for selection. “He’s confident, he’s box office, we all desperately want to see him play,” said Collingwood. “I’m an England fan as much as I am a coach and we all desperately want to see him go about his business.”",Sport/Sport,England turn their attention to improving death bowling,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/england-improve-death-bowling-t20-international-west-indies
1/26/2022,"The owner of high-end London restaurants including the Wolseley and the Delaunay has fallen into administration after trade was devastated by the pandemic. Administrators have been appointed for the venues’ parent company, Corbin & King, after its largest shareholder, the Thai hospitality group Minor International, accused it of failing to meet its financial obligations.  Corbin & King’s restaurants, which also include Brasserie Zédel in Soho, have long been popular with diners ranging from celebrities to captains of industry. The restaurant operations will not be affected by the administration, and will continue to trade. The administration comes amid an escalating disagreement over financing and future strategy between Corbin & King, founded by Chris Corbin and Jeremy King, and Minor International, which holds a 74% stake in the group and has had a controlling position on the company’s board since 2017. The group’s London restaurants have been knocked by repeated closures of hospitality venues during the pandemic, and Minor International said the business was no longer solvent. Minor International, which is the group’s largest lender, said it had provided Corbin & King with £38m in loans and loan guarantees since May 2020. It accused the company of defaulting on its obligations and said it required strong financial support. The move to appoint administrators from FRP comes just days after Corbin & King attempted to file a motion in the high court to try to prevent Minor International from calling in its loan, which would have pushed the company into insolvency, as first reported by the Sunday Times. Dillip Rajakarier, the group chief executive of Minor International, accused King of rejecting its “offers to put the company on a strong financial standing” and said it had “no choice” but to put Corbin & King into administration. Minor said it had been unable to agree on a commercial strategy with King and said it had called on the board to inject more money into the business. Rajakarier said: “Contrary to the picture that Mr King is trying to paint, the business is insolvent and is in strong need of further financial support. Minor is prepared to offer this support to secure the long-term future of Corbin & King’s employees and restaurants.” Minor International insisted it had launched the administration as way of safeguarding the long-term viability of the business, and said it was committed to supporting the group’s staff and preserving the firm’s brands. King insisted there was “absolutely no need to go into administration”. He said the company was “trading extremely well” and continuing to pay its suppliers and staff. He accused Minor International of making a “power play” for the group’s holding company, and stated his intention to buy the company out of administration.",News/Business,Wolseley restaurant owner Corbin & King goes into administration,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/wolseley-restaurant-owner-corbin-king-goes-into-administration
1/26/2022,"What has changed? Having previously said that the Metropolitan police would not investigate Downing Street parties, Dame Cressida Dick confirmed on Tuesday that her force would look into the circumstances surrounding eight gatherings that are alleged to have taken place at Downing Street and other Whitehall premises, in breach of coronavirus regulations. Once again, the temperature has been raised in Westminster, and the normal business of government is displaced by feverish speculation. For the prime minister’s supporters to direct people to ignore this, as some have tried to on the grounds that other issues are more important, is both ridiculous and insulting. Until the question of whether Boris Johnson and his staff broke the law is definitively answered, it will continue to be asked – and rightly so. At least the wait may soon be over, with the report by civil servant Sue Gray expected to be published shortly, in advance of the police’s enquiries.  Undeniably, the whole saga has elements of soap opera, with Mr Johnson’s enemies apparently drip-dripping information according to their own version of No 10’s news management grid. But diverting as the spectacle may be to some, as revelations of illicit celebrations continue to pile up, it is devastating to others who gave up so much during the lockdowns. The danger is that once the story has run its course, the aftertaste will be bitter. The hypocrisy of a leader who says one thing and does another, and who refuses to accept that rules his government told others to stick to (on pain of fines up to £10,000) also apply to him, is not only prompting anger with him but could poison attitudes to politicians and public life more generally. The cavalier attitude to standards is not limited to partying and wallpaper. Resigning from the government in the House of Lords on Monday, Lord Agnew accused ministers of “arrogance” and “schoolboy errors” in their approach to detecting fraud. More than 1,000 companies that received government support were not even trading at the time they received Covid loans. As Labour’s Rachel Reeves put it, billions of pounds (HMRC estimates £5.8bn) have been “gifted to criminals”. The urgency of the pandemic response no more justifies this than it did the scandal surrounding procurement of PPE equipment. Last month, a high court judge ruled that a secret “VIP lane”, through which ministerial contacts offering supplies were fast-tracked, was unlawful. The government now not only stands accused of disastrous mishandling of public money, but of illegality and refusing to put errors right. The contrast to the anxious messages about fiscal prudence that follow any suggestion of increasing benefits, or other public spending, could hardly be more glaring. Flaws in the prime minister’s character, including dishonesty, are not news. The Met now has a crucial role to play, and must prove to the public that the occupants of high office are subject to the same laws as everyone else. But whatever the conclusion of partygate, wider concerns about the conduct of the government are unlikely to go away. Probity, responsibility and care from their leaders are what the public needs, at what remains for many an extremely difficult time. Tory MPs held back from trying to topple their leader last week, nervous for good reason about his most likely replacements. That may well change with the latest developments. It is surely evident that this prime minister is unfit for office.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the PM and the police: this show needs to end | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-pm-and-the-police-this-show-needs-to-end
1/26/2022,"The US president’s need to state on Monday that there is “total unanimity” over how to deal with the Ukraine crisis, like the video call with European leaders which preceded it, was itself evidence of ongoing differences among western allies. There is no dispute about the threat: more than 100,000 Russian troops are now massed near Ukraine’s borders. The US has put 8,500 troops on standby to deploy to Europe to reinforce allies there, while Nato has reinforced its eastern borders with warships and fighter jets. A senior US official briefed on Tuesday that in the event of an invasion, sanctions will “start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there”. In addition to the clear deterrent message, talks continue: Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin’s deputy chief of staff, will meet French, German and Ukrainian officials in Paris on Wednesday, in the “Normandy format”. Set against that, Russia paid little price for the annexation of Crimea and fomenting the separatist uprising in the Donbas region in 2014. There is a credible case that Russia is set on a major military offensive – not merely pursuing coercive diplomacy – and that it is in Moscow’s interests to act before Kyiv receives further arms shipments. Above all, there is at present no visible off-ramp for Vladimir Putin. The very thing he says Russia must counter – Nato’s presence in eastern Europe – is growing because of his own actions. He might take an exit; it’s harder to see him beating a retreat.  So the risks are high and rising. But an attack on Ukraine is not inevitable. French officials have indicated that they regard recent US and UK briefing as alarmist; Kyiv itself is notably more cautious. An analysis by the Centre for Defence Strategies, a Ukrainian thinktank, says a full-scale invasion capturing most of the country in the next few months seems unlikely, given current Russian troop formations. But it also suggests that “hybrid invasion” is already being implemented, citing the recent cyber-attack. Moscow may believe that such methods, along with cross-border missile strikes, sabotage and political meddling, might be enough to effect a change of government. (The EU offer of €1.2bn in emergency financial assistance is designed to reduce pressure on Kyiv.) What price would Russia pay? Its markets have already tanked; and it appears to have amassed a cash stockpile in preparation for sanctions. It believes its control of gas supplies give it asymmetric leverage, especially given Europe’s cost of living crisis. And it may count on distraction and disunity in the west. The stepping up of US rhetoric is in part an attempt to compensate for Joe Biden’s gaffe suggesting Nato division over how to respond to a “minor incursion”. Excitable UK briefing over the weekend comes as the prime minister hopes for people to look beyond his domestic woes. Germany, from history, principle (established policy against arms sales to war zones) and pragmatism (it gets more than half of its gas from Russia), is strikingly more muted; uncertainty persists over how far it would go, especially over the NordStream 2 gas pipeline. Nonetheless, there are signs that the allies are moving closer after Monday’s call – US coordination with Qatar and other suppliers to address the energy shortfall is helpful – and are certainly more united than in 2014. The drumbeat of war is concentrating minds and encouraging solidarity. That must now be maintained and built upon.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the threat to Ukraine: high and rising | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-threat-to-ukraine-high-and-rising
1/26/2022,"The police investigation into Downing Street parties is set to uncover evidence which has not yet been submitted to the Sue Gray inquiry, according to former No 10 staffers. The prime minister’s ex-chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had previously warned that officials were deeply uncomfortable with handing over some evidence to the inquiry, believing they could face retribution for damaging information.  But one senior Tory with knowledge of the inquiry said the announcement of a criminal inquiry on Tuesday made it a “different ballgame”, adding: “Officials who don’t tell Sue Gray the whole truth will not hold back from the cops.” Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, suggested Gray’s inquiry had already found what police believe to be evidence of wrongdoing. “I don’t anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the evidence that it is … necessary, proportionate and appropriate for us to obtain in order to get to the right conclusions,” Dick told members of the London assembly, as she confirmed police were investigating a number of alleged parties in Downing Street and Whitehall. Another senior source who had spoken to the Gray inquiry said there were HR obligations on current civil service staff to speak to the Cabinet Office probe but no such obligations for staff who have left. “There is a big dilemma for those who have something but haven’t been asked about it directly,” they said. “It’s one thing to be asked and not lie, it’s another to volunteer and then it becomes known you volunteered. “There’s a political reality to this investigation – depending on whether you think this prime minister can survive. Lots of people will be worried he will be wounded but not ousted.” Cummings said he had submitted written evidence to Gray by email with her consent. He said he would reply to further questions but would not be interviewed in person as he did not trust Boris Johnson not to leak his conversations. He has claimed Johnson was warned in advance that it was a breach of lockdown rules to hold a “bring your own booze” party on 20 May 2020, after an invitation was sent to about 100 Downing Street staff by Martin Reynolds, the prime minister’s principal private secretary. Cummings claimed he and another senior official warned in advance that the party was a mistake – but Johnson has said he believed the No 10 garden drinks constituted a work event. Cummings has said he will do an open question-and-answer session after the Gray report is published where he is could make a series of new revelations, depending on the evidence in the report. The former adviser wrote on his blog that he believed officials would not hand over crucial evidence to the inquiry. “I know others are very worried about handing things to the Cabinet Office because they know the PM will see everything SG [Sue Gray] collects,” he said. “This inevitably means that evidence, including photos, is not given to her and instead will keep leaking after her report. To stress, this is a consequence of beliefs about the PM’s integrity, not SG’s.” Breaches of lockdown rules are dealt with via fixed penalty notices and are unlikely to count as a criminal offence unless resisted via the courts, meaning they would not have to be declared to an employer. Dick made clear during her evidence that the kind of offences being investigated could result in a fine.",News/Politics,"No 10 parties: police will uncover evidence not in Gray report, say ex-staffers",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/no-10-parties-police-will-uncover-evidence-not-in-gray-report-say-ex-staffers
1/26/2022,"Women’s rights groups have called for a statutory inquiry into misogyny in the Metropolitan police after derogatory comments by officers about an academic while she was strip-searched showed how “deeply embedded” sexism is in the force. In CCTV footage published by the Guardian, police officers made disparaging remarks about Konstancja Duff while she was strip-searched at Stoke Newington police station.  Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, was among the many people to express shock and outrage on Twitter, describing the incident as “disgraceful” and “strongly condemn[ing]” the officers’ behaviour and language. This is utterly disgraceful. I strongly condemn the derogatory and sexist actions towards Dr. Duff. The Met are right to have apologised for this appalling incident.Women in our city must be able to trust the police.https://t.co/BgiVTcpXLw On Tuesday, women’s rights campaigners said the episode was yet further evidence of institutional misogyny in the force. The Met has faced sexism scandals for decades but particularly in the nine months since Sarah Everard was kidnapped, raped and murdered by Wayne Couzens, an officer in an elite Met firearms unit. Anna Birley, of Reclaim These Streets, said the actions of the officers who strip-searched Duff, as well as the Met taking eight years to disclose the footage, “means this cannot be written off as yet another bad apple”. “By closing ranks to protect their own, and forcing Konstancja to have to fight so hard to simply get an apology, it’s clear that this is institutional, and as such amounts to nothing less than state-sanctioned sexual assault,” Birley said. “Misogyny in the Met police is systemic and cultural – and this is why we have been calling for the Wayne Couzens inquiry to be widened in scope and made statutory. Without this, we risk the Met yet again closing ranks, prioritising their own reputation over women’s safety and blaming a handful of named officers rather than the culture that created and protected them. “And in the meantime, the Met must urgently confirm that all officers involved will face robust and transparent disciplinary action – without this, how can women ever trust them?” Priti Patel, the home secretary, is facing a legal challenge over proposals for an inquiry into Couzens’ conduct as a police officer, with critics claiming it is too narrow in scope. The Centre for Women’s Justice began judicial review proceedings against her department in December, also calling for the inquiry to be put on a statutory basis. Duff’s case was a prime example of why that needed to happen, Debaleena Dasgupta, a solicitor with CWJ, said. Dasgupta added: “The CCTV footage in Dr Duff’s case shows how deeply embedded, and tolerated, sexism is in the Metropolitan police. A further question arises: why did it take so long for the police to provide that evidence, despite the earlier complaint proceedings? “This case will add to women’s mistrust in policing. It is another example of why, if Priti Patel is serious about restoring faith in the police, that her inquiry must be conducted on a statutory footing so it has the power to compel evidence and must be widened to look at all the relevant issues.” But for some campaigners, yet another inquiry into policing was not enough. Sasha McLean, of the activist group Sisters Uncut, said policing was a job that attracted and created people with “the proclivity for coercion and control”, and solving that required radical change. “We have to move beyond this idea that the police can somehow be reformed or changed internally, that if we just investigate and tinker around the edges we can make it slightly less sexist than it is already, because the issue is fundamental, it’s structural, it’s institutional, it has to do with the fact that police exist to coerce and control urban and working-class populations,” McLean said. “I’m not going to say that we don’t welcome scrutiny, but at the end of the day the investigation’s being conducted by the very people who rely on the police to protect their own power, so this investigation is hardly going to reveal that the police has got an institutional, fundamental problem that perhaps require a complete reworking and abolition of the institution.”",News/UK news,Rights groups call for statutory inquiry into misogyny in the Met,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/rights-groups-call-for-statutory-inquiry-into-misogyny-in-the-met
1/26/2022,"US oil firms have been accused of using scare tactics after telling a federal court on Tuesday that lawsuits alleging fossil fuel companies lied about the climate crisis could threaten America’s oil supply. At a closely watched appeals court hearing to decide whether a lawsuit by the city of Baltimore should be heard in state or federal court, an attorney for BP, Exxon, Shell and other energy firms painted the case as a threat to America’s energy independence.  Kannon Shanmugam, representing the industry, told the court that if the city were to succeed in state court, and win billions of dollars in compensation, that could kill offshore drilling. “The relief that Baltimore seeks would deter, if not render entirely impractical, any further production on the outer continental shelf,” he said. Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University who specialises in climate litigation, called the claim one of a number of “sterile scare tactics” deployed by the oil industry as it fights to move the Baltimore and other cases out of state jurisdictions, where consumer protection and other laws favour the plaintiffs, and in to federal courts where the fossil fuel companies believe they have the advantage. “It’s a scare tactic, which is telling the courts to back off, we’re a very powerful industry and we’re essential right now to energy security. If you step into this, you’re going to screw everything up,” she said. Baltimore’s case accuses oil firms of breaching Maryland state consumer protection and other laws by running disinformation campaigns to cover up what they knew about the dangers of burning fossil fuels. The outcome of Tuesday’s hearing will influence similar cases within the same federal jurisdiction, including a suit by Charleston, South Carolina. It may also have a bearing on nearly a dozen other lawsuits by states and municipalities in other jurisdictions. A federal appeals court in Hawaii is scheduled to hear a similar case next month. Shanmugam told the court that the case should fall under federal jurisdiction because pollution is regulated by national laws, and the climate crisis is a national and international issue. Shanmugam also accused Baltimore and other municipalities of using the courts to try and change climate policy. “Global climate change is obviously the subject of international agreements, as well as pervasive regulation by the federal government,“ he said. Vic Sher, representing Baltimore, said that the city’s case is not about the regulation of pollution but the lies told by the fossil fuel industry. “The goal of the complaint, sadly, cannot address global climate change. It’s focused very narrowly on a past pattern of conduct based on deception and failure to warn, and it seeks compensatory damages for injuries that flow from that past conduct,” he said. Sokol said the judges appeared “very sceptical” about the basis of the oil industry’s claim that the Baltimore case belongs in federal court. She said the industry’s legal argument did not address the substance of the city’s claim that big oil ran a disinformation campaign and lied about the harm caused by its part in creating the climate crisis, and instead tried to put the focus on who regulates pollution. Sokol said that if the appeals court decision goes against the oil industry she expects the firms to try to go back to the supreme court as part of a strategy to delay the Baltimore and other cases being heard by a jury for as long as possible. “It will continue to fight this thing out in the procedural stage till hell freezes over, before it allows it to get to discovery, much less a trial, because it knows the civil discovery system of state courts is so powerful that it would be forced to discord documents that would shed light on the extent of this disinformation campaign even beyond what we already know.”",News/Environment,Oil firms accused of scare tactics after claiming climate lawsuits ‘a threat to US’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/25/climate-lawsuits-oil-firms-bp-exxon-shell
1/26/2022,"Covid cases in the UK have fallen sharply in the past few weeks, and hospital admissions appeared to have turned a corner. But now, it seems, the situation has stalled, with cases bobbing around 90,000 per day. The reason for the change is that while case rates are falling among adults, they are rising among children – where vaccination rates remain sluggish.  According to data for England, the rate of new cases per 100,000 people fell from 1,430.4 among 60 to 64-year-olds in the rolling seven-day period to 1 January, to 529.3 in the rolling seven-day period to 19 January. However, they rose from 941.6 to 2,384.1 for children aged 5 to 9 during the same period, and from 1,230 to 1,909.7 for children aged 10 to 14. The Department for Education’s latest attendance figures show that 374,000 children were absent from school with confirmed or suspected infections of coronavirus. In the last week before Christmas, the figure was 199,000. However, these DfE figures do not include children who were off after having a positive PCR test, who are counted separately as being off ill. One intervention available for some children is vaccination. However, according to the latest data from the UK Health Security Agency, uptake of first doses has been slowing, with 52% of children aged 12-15 having received at least one Covid jab. While vulnerable 5 to 11-year-olds are now eligible for Covid vaccinations, with a national rollout expected by the end of January, some GPs are already giving jabs – although a lack of paediatric doses means at present this tends to be where there is capacity to use fractionated adult doses off-label. Prof Christina Pagel, the director of University College London’s clinical operational research unit, said one reason for the slow uptake of jabs among adolescents is a lack of clear messaging from bodies including the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the cabinet and the chief medical officers that they should be vaccinated against Covid. Pagel added that long Covid and the rare paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PIMS-TS) are serious concerns, while the proportion of young children hospitalised with Covid has risen – although others have noted most cases are “mild” and may reflect the lower threshold for bringing infants into hospital. “[It’s] almost like there’s this understandable desire to reassure, and that ends up kind of minimising [the importance of vaccination],” said Pagel, adding that all children aged 5 and above should be offered the jabs. But others – such as Prof Russell Viner of UCL – suggest the slow uptake of jabs is down to a host of factors from logistical challenges to initially only offering jabs through the school vaccination programme, and that while evolving messaging may have led to some uncertainty among parents and children, it was the right approach to take – not least because of early concerns about myocarditis. Prof Adam Finn, the head of the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre and a member of the JCVI, said Covid is a mild disease in childhood, while evidence suggests long Covid is rarer, milder and less long lasting than in adults. Finn added that it is not surprising vaccination rates are lower in adolescents than adults, noting vaccines are “not that good” at preventing onward transmission and adolescents have lower risks from Covid. While vaccination of healthy 5 to 11-year-olds is under discussion that, too, is a difficult decision, he said. Such disagreements look set to continue. But one thing is clear: when it comes to children, there are many lessons yet to be learned around how best to manage a pandemic.",News/World news,Child Covid infections are rising in England – is low vaccine rate a factor?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/child-covid-infections-are-rising-in-england-is-low-vaccine-rate-a-factor
1/26/2022,"The print edition of the Daily Mail has remained one of Boris Johnson’s strongest backers in the media, even as other rightwing news outlets – including its sister outlet MailOnline – are increasingly critical of the beleaguered prime minister. On Tuesday the Daily Mail used its editorial to bemoan that “we are in the grip of a collective madness” over the ongoing stories about parties in Downing Street, suggesting those focusing on it are indirectly backing Russian aggression against Ukraine.  “For as Britain obsesses about parties, Vladimir Putin has been busy cranking up his formidable war machine. It is now fully primed for attack,” the paper proclaimed. This intervention comes after Ted Verity, the outlet’s new editor, ran a rare front page editorial last week decrying the Conservative MPs trying to oust Johnson: “Putin poised to start a war. Inflation soaring. Yet a narcissistic rabble of Tory MPs are trying to topple PM who’s leading us out of Covid. Today, as their plot crumbles, the Mail echoes one of their ringleaders to tell them... IN THE NAME OF GOD, GROW UP!” By comparison, the editors at MailOnline – which has its own editorial structure and reaches substantially more readers – on Tuesday ran critical headlines such as “FINAL BLOW FOR BORIS?” and “CARRIE: LET US EAT CAKE”. The latter featured a picture of the prime minister’s wife Carrie Johnson next to her grinning husband, channelling the quote often erroneously misascribed to Marie Antoinette. Even as print newspaper sales continue to plummet, their front pages continue to set agendas in Westminster and shape the thinking of both politicians and Downing Street. Although there is no chance of the Daily Mail pulling its support for the Conservatives, the outlet’s personal support for the prime minister could help keep him as party leader in the short run. The Daily Mail had become more critical of Johnson at the end of last year under the editorship of Geordie Greig, when it was highly critical of Johnson’s refurbishment of the Downing Street flat and his handling of an investigation into the disgraced former MP Owen Paterson. But Greig was ousted last November and replaced by Verity, who has in recent days tried to focus on an old story about Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer having a beer in a constituency office. There are clues as to what the Daily Mail may want in return for this support. The newspaper has made it clear that it thinks Johnson should scrap April’s introduction of new health and social care tax on income, linking the issue to Johnson’s leadership chances in editorials. Perhaps more worrying for the prime minister is the decision of the Telegraph titles to turn their fire on his leadership. The newspaper had loyally employed the prime minister for decades, with Johnson fitting in his political roles around his £275,000 job writing a weekly column for the outlet. It may now be hard to repair relations with the Telegraph following its stories, which include a front page on Sunday highlighting a a technical breach of Covid guidance by Carrie Johnson and the revelation that a “suitcase of wine” was wheeled into Downing Street to fuel one lockdown-breaking office party. The other outlet which does remain staunchly loyal to the prime minister is the Daily Express, which has run repeatedly run pro-Johnson front pages in recent days – despite the outlet being edited by a lifelong Labour supporter.",News/Media,‘Let us eat cake’: how UK newspapers reacted to latest No 10 party claims,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/25/how-the-newspapers-reacted-to-downing-street-parties
1/26/2022,"The US-focused shake-out in financial markets has at least given us clarity on one point: bitcoin is not “digital gold” or a “store of value”, to mention two grand claims made about the cryptocurrency when its price was going up. At $37,000, the late-afternoon level on Tuesday, bitcoin has fallen by 22% since the start of January and by 45% since recording an all-time high in early November. The crypto crew may have convoluted explanations for this setback, but the simplest one is best: bitcoin has always primarily been an instrument for pure speculation; when high-risk assets are out of favour, it will be clobbered.  If anything, Bitcoin is behaving like a souped-up proxy for the technology-heavy Nasdaq index in the US, down 14% since the start of 2022. So the parallel claim about “uncorrelated returns” doesn’t stack up either. Meanwhile actual gold, a real store of value on the evidence of a few thousand years, has been doing roughly what it is supposed to do during an inflation scare: it has fluttered sideways to gently upwards over the past few months. None of which precludes the possibility that bitcoin will rally when risk-taking appetites recover. But, if that happens, please let’s not hear a reheated version of the thesis (pushed by a Goldman Sachs strategist, bizarrely, only a few weeks ago) that bitcoin is competing with gold in “the store of value market” and thus could hit $100,000 if it grabs a 50% share. Come on, cryptocurrencies are not playing on the same pitch, asset-wise, as gold – and one doubts they ever will. It wasn’t Unilever’s plan B, which was probably just as well. Investors would be unimpressed if the sole response to the failed £50bn tilt at GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products business was an organisational shuffle that will remove 1,500 management roles around the world. Tuesday’s “simplification” of the business model will have been planned for ages. Details of a big strategic rethink, one assumes, will come with next month’s full-year results. One can say, though, that the rejig should make it marginally easier for Unilever to churn its portfolio, which could be one part of the boardroom thinking that survives the GSK misadventure. Out goes Unilever’s “matrix” structure, a description of reporting lines arranged according to a mish-mash of geographies and products. In comes a theoretically simpler division of responsibilities along purely product lines. So: beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition and ice-cream. The possibly important detail is the sub-division of food between the nutritious stuff and ice-cream. The latter, including Wall’s and Ben & Jerry’s, looks an obvious candidate for disposal if the chief executive, Alan Jope, still hopes to sell assets to fund expansion in beauty and wellbeing. It’s hard to quibble with the organisational reform since it brings Unilever roughly into line with Procter & Gamble, a company many shareholders wish their company could be more like. Jope promises the new arrangement will deliver “crystal clear accountability for delivery”. The buck, though, ultimately stops on his desk, as he will know after a bruising fortnight. His real plan B has to be slick. Tech-obsessed officials at the London Stock Exchange need to be alert. Nvidia, the US semiconductor chip giant, is preparing to abandon its $40bn takeover pursuit of Arm Holdings, reported Bloomberg on Tuesday; and the UK company’s current owner, SoftBank of Japan, is said to be lining up a flotation, or IPO, as an alternative. Before SoftBank’s purchase in 2016, Arm was London’s strongest claim to seriousness in tech. A relisting would give scope for an uplifting “coming home” tale for a company born in a barn outside Cambridge whose chip designs became world-leading. It would be a shocker if SoftBank were to shove Arm towards New York. Mind you, an IPO anywhere would create a messaging headache for Arm chief executive Simon Segars. Here’s what he wrote last July in a blogpost that furiously defended the benefits of acquisition by Nvidia and tried to allay the regulatory and competition concerns that now appear likely to kill the deal: “We contemplated an IPO but determined that the pressure to deliver short-term revenue growth and profitability would suffocate our ability to invest, expand, move fast and innovate”. So, roll up, who wants to buy shares in a company where the boss says independence will feel like suffocation?

1/26/2022,"Tottenham have had a €45m (£37.6m) offer for Luis Díaz rejected by Porto. Antonio Conte wants to strengthen his squad before the transfer window shuts next Monday and Díaz has emerged as a key target. Spurs are braced for a busy week and want to move players in and out. They are hopeful of an agreement with Wolves for Adama Traoré, who Conte intends to convert into a right wing-back, but they will have to increase their offer for Díaz.  The Porto winger has a £66m release clause and the Portuguese side have told Spurs that their opening bid for the 25-year-old is not enough. Diaz, a 25-year-old Colombia international, is one of the most exciting talents in Europe and has scored 14 goals in 18 league games this season. He has also been linked with Manchester United. Conte has made clear that Spurs must revamp their squad if they are to challenge at the top of the Premier League. The Italian, whose side are seventh, also wants to strengthen in central midfield. He has looked at Fiorentina’s Sofyan Amrabat, who is his preferred option, and Milan’s Franck Kessié, who is out of contract this summer. Spurs are ready to offload players not in Conte’s plans. Tanguy Ndombele, the club’s record buy, could join Paris Saint-Germain on loan. Dele Alli and Giovani Lo Celso are also available after failing to make the bench against Chelsea last weekend. Newcastle are interested in a loan deal for Alli, who has also been linked with Southampton.",Sport/Football,Tottenham have £37.6m bid for winger Luis Díaz rejected by Porto,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/tottenham-have-376m-bid-for-winger-luis-diaz-rejected-by-porto
1/26/2022,"The tech sector led US stock markets on a pandemic boom last year. Now markets are whipsawing on fears that the Federal Reserve will end the era of easy money, all while a potential war in Ukraine looms. Some warn of a bigger correction to come on a scale not seen since the dotcom collapse of the late 1990s.  On Monday, US stock markets crashed then rallied. The Dow Jones at one point lost more than 1,000 points before ending up just over 100. Analysts expect more volatile days ahead. The Fed on Wednesday issued its latest update on its plans to raise rates in order to curb inflation, and the world’s largest tech firms are preparing to issue their latest results to investors, who appear to have grown more skeptical about their prospects. Jeremy Grantham, the British co-founder of Boston-based investment manager GMO, believes the US is now in a “super-bubble” comparable to the dotcom era, the Wall Street crash of 1929, and the housing market madness of 2006. It is not just tech that has blown up, but housing prices, commodities and bond prices. The “wild rumpus” has begun, according to Grantham. It is unlikely to end soon. The latest test of investor resolve comes later on Tuesday when Microsoft releases its latest quarterly results. The Seattle-based tech giant is expected to announce sales topping half a billion a day and a profit of more than $17bn. Huge numbers, but will it be enough for Wall Street? Microsoft will be followed by Apple, Tesla, Intel and Samsung this week, with more to come from Alphabet, Amazon and Meta next month – a litmus test for a newly acid view on a sector that now dominates the stock markets and much of daily life. Already one of the pandemic’s winners has shown how much the mood has changed. Netflix, which boomed during the pandemic lockdowns, saw its share price collapse after a disappointing earnings result last week that predicted a slowdown in subscribers. For Brian Wieser, president of business intelligence at GroupM Global, Netflix’s woes may have been the catalyst that changed investor confidence in the sector. “Investors generally need a catalyst for an action,” he said. The rising cost of capital has worried investors that the days of heady growth are over. But this isn’t a repeat of the dotcom bubble, he said. Today’s tech titans are sitting on huge piles of cash and are still making big profits. “Netflix is still going to spend $20bn on content this year,” he said. Apple has more than $195bn in cash, and Microsoft has another $130bn. The vertiginous swings markets are experiencing are partly down to today’s “hyper-connected” world, according to Michael Antonelli, managing director at Robert W Baird. “Markets, data, sentiment, trading, podcasts, blogs: everybody knows everything instantly and they can act on any emotion with the push of a button.” Today’s losses are somebody’s future gains, he noted in a blogpost. But added: “Humans are irrational creatures; they aren’t going to take the time to think about their actions when they can push a button and quiet the pain receptor in their brain.”",News/Business,Let the wild rumpus start: is the US facing a stock market ‘super-bubble’?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/us-stock-markets-bubble-tech-results-investors
1/26/2022,"Big Dog was having a bad morning. Normally he could rely on Grant Shapps to put up a spirited defence of any government lie, which is why he had been sent out to do the morning media round. But not even the transport secretary had been bothered to put a positive spin on the latest birthday party revelations. He had even made the schoolboy error of calling a party a party, when everyone knew that word was a no-no inside No 10.  Nor had the usually reliable Nadine Dorries shown her face on Twitter after being ridiculed for claiming the previous evening that a birthday celebration for the prime minister in the cabinet room, organised by his wife, andattended by the interior designer, Lulu Lytle, , clearly constituted a high-level work meeting. In fact, the only two MPs showing any public enthusiasm for him had been the always absurd Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Fabricant. Which was a mixed blessing as he haemorrhaged support every time they opened their mouths. Then had come the appearance of the Metropolitan police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, before a committee of the Greater London assembly. There she had announced that, after Sue Gray had forwarded some of the evidence she had gathered, a police investigation into some of the parties at No 10 would be a good idea after all. Dick had offered Boris Johnson some encouragement. For a start she had said she would only be investigating parties for which there was already plenty of evidence. Far be it from the Met to actually go to the effort of digging up any new evidence for itself. That would be a waste of police time. And she had seemed reassuringly slow on the uptake about the failure of the police stationed inside Downing Street to wonder what all the noise was and why so much booze had been smuggled into the building. It also appeared to have only just occurred to her that there might be CCTV footage of some of the parties. No, not parties. Work events. Even so, a police investigation wasn’t ideal. Big Dog sighed and poured himself a drink even though it was only just past midday. On the plus side, it might delay things for a few weeks or even months. That was always good news when your only gameplan for the past few weeks had been to find ever more creative ways of trying to hang on to your job till the end of the day. The downside was Sue Gray must have found clear evidence that he – and others – had broken the lockdown laws and the shit was sure to hit the fan sooner or later. His more immediate worry, though, was to find a Cabinet Office minister stupid enough to answer Labour’s urgent question on the latest party allegations and the police investigation. “Don’t worry, prime minister,” said Steve Barclay, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. “I’ve got just the man. It’s Mike Ellis, the paymaster general. He’s already made himself look abject by doing two previous UQs on your parties …” “Please don’t call them parties,” said Big Dog. “It makes me nervous.” So it was that Oily Mike found himself up against Angela Rayner in the Commons for the third time in a matter of weeks. Labour’s deputy leader went in studs up. What part of the prime minister stuffing his face with a Colin the Caterpillar cake, which his wife had just happened to bring down – along with darling Lulu – from the upstairs flat to the cabinet room, where 30 of his staff had just happened to gather to sing Happy Birthday, did everyone not understand was against the rules that the government had itself imposed on the rest of the country? You hardly needed a police investigation for that, but hell, now that there was one we had better see it through. And in the meantime why didn’t Big Dog just resign? Oily Mike was momentarily taken off guard. What should he call the prime minister? The Accused? The Perp? The Defendant? No, that was it. The Suspect. MPs shouldn’t be so quick to pre-judge the Suspect. It was quite normal for the Suspect to drop in for a quick cup of tea with his wife. And the 30 guests were all waiting to debrief him on an important fraudulent Covid test-and-trace contract. And they were only singing Happy Birthday to wash their hands. And as it was a surprise party there was no way you could expect the Suspect to remember having been there. Otherwise it wouldn’t have been a surprise. As for the cake, the Suspect had a long history of thinking he could both have it and eat it. On previous occasions, very few Tories had come to the chamber to make idiots of themselves. But this time there was a hardcore of about 20 Boris loyalists. Edward Leigh raged that we were on the brink of war and the PM was about to be brought down by a piece of cake. Theresa Villiers was adamant that the Suspect should have an exemption because he had helped to organise the vaccination programme. Giles Watling moaned that all criminality committed by the Suspect was a vexatious waste of time, while Graham Stuart thought he could detect terror in the opposition benches. In the government benches maybe. Where do Tory selection panels find such idiots? Stuart Anderson reckoned the charges were destabilising the country and should be dropped while Mark Jenkinson detected a media plot. To discover the truth. Richard Bacon thought the crimes were so minor they should just be forgotten and that we should have a 10-day celebration for the life and works of St Suspect. Back in Downing Street, the Suspect thought he had things nailed down for now. Maybe the Met would take so long to report back that everyone would forget he was a liar who had broken his own rules. That he could bring the country down to his level by implicating it in his nihilism and deception. That somehow we had got the government we deserved. People so disengaged they’d let anything go. Then came the unwelcome news that Sue Gray’s report would be published this week. Now the shit really might hit the fan. Even the Suspect thought it was touch and go whether he could talk his way out of this one.",News/Politics,"Big Dog was now The Suspect, but at least Gray’s report would be delayed… Oh. | John Crace",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/big-dog-suspect-but-at-least-sue-grays-report-would-be-delayed-oh
