3/11/2022,"WASHINGTON — A supporter of Donald Trump who is alleged to have ""blind-sided"" and pushed a Capitol Police officer over a ledge during the Jan. 6 riot was arrested at his home in New York City on Wednesday. Ralph Joseph Celentano, 54, of Queens, was arrested by the FBI and charged with assaulting an officer in the performance of their duties, impeding officers during a civil disorder, engaging in physical violence on Capitol grounds, an act of physical violence on Capitol grounds and disorderly conduct on restricted grounds, according to court documents. A law enforcement source said Celentano is unemployed. Celentano, who had a ""very distinct folding chair strapped to his back"" and a Trump hat on his head, was seen on video shoving a Capitol Police officer from behind, causing the officer to fall over a ledge, authorities said. Online sleuths seeking to identify Jan. 6 suspects had dubbed the man #ChairGuy, and he was listed as individual #107 on the FBI's Capitol Violence website. The Capitol Police officer, identified by the initials ""K.E.,"" told the FBI that he recalled being ""blind-sided"" from behind in a ""football-type tackle"" and falling to the terrace below. ""Officer K.E. said he probably sustained injuries during the fall, but he had so much adrenaline at that time that he could not be sure,"" the FBI affidavit says. ""Officer K.E., an Iraq war veteran, recalled thinking 'I didn't survive a war to go out like this.'"" Celentano also got in several other physical confrontations with officers on Jan. 6, 2021, the FBI affidavit alleges. It appears that online sleuths played a role in the case. The FBI affidavit says Celentano was ""found in a photograph publicly posted to a social media account."" The bureau said it confirmed Celentano's identity by interviewing another person featured in the social media photos, who had known Celentano for more than 13 years. The FBI then got EZ Pass toll information from a car operated by Celentano's significant other, showing that it left Broad Channel, New York, at 3 a.m. ET the day of the riot and returned at around 7:30 p.m. ET on Jan. 7. NBC New York first reported Celentano's arrest and said there was a heavy law enforcement presence at his home. The arrest Wednesday followed the Justice Department's victory in its case against Guy Reffitt, the first Jan. 6 case brought to trial. After they deliberated for barely two hours Tuesday, jurors convicted Reffitt on all five charges. The FBI has made over 775 arrests in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, federal authorities say. Online sleuths investigating the attack, who have identified hundreds of defendants, counted more than 2,500 people who are believed to have either unlawfully entered the Capitol or assaulted law enforcement officers outside the building. Hundreds of people on the FBI's website remain at large.",U.S./NBC News,FBI arrests Trump supporter alleged to have 'blind-sided' Capitol cop on Jan. 6,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-supporter-blind-sided-capitol-190409164.html
3/11/2022,"A former Russian foreign minister insisted that Vladimir Putin would not use nuclear weapons and the West should not limit its actions or support for Ukraine over fear he would do so. ""The Kremlin knows it can try to extract concessions, whether from Ukraine or the West, by saber-rattling its last remaining card in the deck: nuclear weapons,"" Andrei Kozyrev wrote. ""The ultimate conclusion here is that the West should not agree to any unilateral concessions or limit its support of Ukraine too much for fear of nuclear war."" POWER KNOCKED OUT TO CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT, UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS SAY: LIVE UPDATES Kozyrev, who served as Russia’s foreign minister between 1991 and 1996, claimed that Putin was still a ""rational actor"" in a series of thoughts posted on Twitter Sunday. Putin, he argued, instead has possibly ""started to believe his own propagandists,"" such as a ""Nazi-Bandera junta"" running the country. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ADMITS USE OF CONSCRIPTS IN INVASION, DESPITE PUTIN'S DENIALS Kozyrev laid out three points as to why Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine was ""rational,"" but also ""wrong and immoral"": He genuinely believed that Ukraine was a satellite nation and not an independent nation; the Russian military has suffered rampant corruption; and Putin, along with the Russian elite, believed that President Biden was ""mentally inept"" and the EU was ""toothless."" ""If you believe all three of the above to be true and your goal is to restore the glory of the Russian Empire (whatever that means), then it is perfectly rational to invade Ukraine,"" Kozyrev tweeted. UKRAINE'S CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT LOSES POWER, SPARKING FEAR OF RADIATION LEAKS And if Putin is acting ""rationally,"" the West should not fear he will engage in nuclear war, Kozyrev added. He also argued that the botched U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ""solidified"" the narrative of weakness in the West. Instead, President Biden and the EU were able to come together as a unified front through NATO to support Ukraine and hit Russia with crippling sanctions that leave it on the brink of default.",World/Fox News,"Former Russian minister says Putin is 'rational,' West shouldn't 'limit Ukraine support over nuclear fear'",https://news.yahoo.com/former-russian-minister-says-putin-155552877.html
3/11/2022,"By Humeyra Pamuk WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council will convene on Friday at Russia's request, diplomats said, to discuss Moscow's claims, presented without evidence, of U.S. ""biological activities"" in Ukraine, a move Washington described as gaslighting. The meeting is expected to be in the morning. ""Russian Mission asked for a meeting of #SecurityCouncil for 11 March to discuss the military biological activities of the US on the territory of #Ukraine,"" Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations said in a tweet. The United States on Wednesday denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biological warfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"" and suggesting Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon. ""This is exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,"" Olivia Dalton, spokesperson, U.S. Mission to the United Nations said on Thursday. ""Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law...We’re not going to let Russia get away with gaslighting,"" she added. Late on Tuesday, Russia repeated its accusation of several years that the United States is working with Ukrainian laboratories to develop biological weapons. Such assertions in Russian media increased in the run-up to Moscow's military move into Ukraine and were made as recently as Wednesday by foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. In a statement, also released on Wednesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia ""is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine."" Like many other countries, Ukraine has public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans. Its laboratories have received support from the United States, European Union and World Health Organization.
