2/25/2022,"Amid the boasts on Khabib, the first song of Central Cee’s debut album, lurks the line “I been in the charts for 18 weeks”. The track – named for an undefeated Russian mixed martial arts fighter – is a rare moment of understatement. The London rapper has spent 18 weeks in the Top 10 alone: he’s actually been in the singles chart for 97 weeks since his first crossover hit, Loading, arrived in late 2020. By anyone’s metric, Central Cee had a very good 2021 indeed: a gold album for his first mixtape, Wild West; six hit singles – eight if you count his collaboration with D-Block Europe and his appearance on a remix of Ed Sheeran’s Bad Habits – and three nominations at the Brits. Thanks to a guest slot on FKA twigs’ Measure of a Man, he even ended up on the soundtrack of the most recent Kingsman film, seldom noted for boosting UK trap.  It’s not meant to underplay the years the 23-year-old born Oakley Ceasar-Su spent developing his craft – he started out slathering his voice in Auto-Tune before shifting to a more drill-facing sound – to suggest that his actual success has happened very quickly. You can hear it in the lyrics of 23, which come thick with memories of his pre-fame life that still seem to have happened just “the other day”. One minute he’s getting nicked in the crowd at the Wireless festival – apparently for the crime of “trying to get the party turnt”, which presumably wasn’t the precise wording on the arrest form – the next, he’s playing the main stage on both Saturday and Sunday. If you’re wondering how he’s done it, 23 provides some intriguing pointers. As a rapper, he’s possessed of a powerful flow and can turn a phrase – “I had no money / I weren’t embarrassed / I’m doin’ up road in my Toyota Yaris” – but the lyrics tend to stick fast to the usual topics: a rough upbringing (chucked out of home aged 14, left school with no GCSEs); a pre-rap life of crime; the bragging tempered by affecting bursts of regret, as on Ungrateful, which expresses the desire to “turn the page … anti-clockwise, got to burn the sage”; success and its associated feuds and drawbacks. He briefly steps out of character on Retail Therapy, where he expresses a desire to connect with his “female energy” by going shopping and gets a ticking off from his mum for being “materialistic”, but for the most part it deals in the expected done well rather than springing surprises. But 23 also displays how good Central Cee is at the business of making records, not just writing. There are a lot of really strong musical ideas on display, some of which are the work of producer Young Chencs, whose sonic signature is all over the album, quite literally: you’re never far from a female voice announcing who’s produced the beat. The hook of Retail Therapy takes a snatch of sax from Hank Crawford’s 1973 jazz album Wildflower and subjects it to the kind of speeding-up treatment common in early 90s hardcore rave: the result is nagging and unique. Just before it ends, the backing of Air BnB suddenly shifts from merely lifting the electric piano from a 70s soft rock track and turns into the 70s soft rock it’s been sampling, while Central Cee keeps rapping. The brief Terminal 5 is based around another great, unexpectedly jazzy sample, this time of a ragged trumpet-led band. Elsewhere, the idea of borrowing from PinkPantheress’ Just for Me on Obsessed With You is inspired, and not merely because it guaranteed the track – released as a single in September – vast coverage on TikTok, where PinkPantheress is a breakout star. The sound of the original – essentially an early-00s pop-garage cut turned helium-voiced and oddly unsettling – is a perfect counterpoint to the rapper’s voice. The best track might be the most unexpected: Eurovision, on which Central Cee assembles a phalanx of guests, his fellow Shepherd’s Bush native A2anti joined by two rappers apiece from France, Italy and Spain. In one sense, it’s a risk to cede a huge swathe of a track to names that are essentially unknown in the UK and who perform in their native languages (although it may buy him headway in their respective fiercely competitive domestic rap scenes). But it really pays off: Milan’s Rondodasosa, with whom Central Cee guested on a single last year, is a particularly striking find, a furious, gruff voice rapping in a mix of Italian and English. The effect is subtly different, while firmly rooted in a tradition: much like the rest of 23.

2/25/2022,"Social media users could be cut off from other accounts on platforms such as Twitter if they do not sign up for ID verification, under government proposals to tackle anonymous trolls. Popular services including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram will be required to give users the option to opt in or opt out from receiving messages, replies and content from unverified or anonymous accounts. Verified users could also block unverified or anonymous accounts from seeing their content under the opt in/opt out proposals.  This means people or organisations without verified accounts – symbolised by a blue tick on Twitter and Instagram – would be blocked from communicating with, or being seen by, accounts that have opted out from interactions with unverified sources. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said platforms had a number of options for verifying users, including using government-issued ID such as a passport to open an account or using two-factor authentication, where a platform sends a prompt to a user’s mobile phone. The new system will be introduced under the online safety bill, which requires tech firms to protect users from harmful content or face the threat of substantial fines imposed by Ofcom, the communications regulator. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said: “Tech firms have a responsibility to stop anonymous trolls polluting their platforms.” She added: “People will now have more control over who can contact them and be able to stop the tidal wave of hate served up to them by rogue algorithms.” The government has ruled out banning anonymity online entirely, acknowledging that it would be damaging for domestic abuse victims, activists living in authoritarian countries or young people exploring their sexuality. The ID move was welcomed by the Football Association, which has called for action against racist and abusive online trolls who often operate anonymously. Edleen John, the director of corporate affairs and co-partner for equality, diversity and inclusion at the FA, said: “On behalf of English football, we welcome the news that the government will be strengthening the online safety bill to protect users from anonymous online abuse. For too long, footballers and other participants across the game have been subjected to abhorrent discriminatory abuse from those who hide behind a cloak of anonymity, which has perpetuated a culture of impunity online. This needs to stop.” However, Big Brother Watch, a privacy campaign group, said the proposed change represented another move towards an ID scheme for the internet. “The government’s plans to undermine online anonymity will do untold damage to privacy and free speech rights in the UK. This move towards ID for the internet is unnecessary and will have no discernible impact on the tone of conversations online,” said Mark Johnson, BBW’s legal and policy officer. In a further change to the online safety bill, the government is also proposing to introduce a requirement for popular social media sites to give users an option for blocking “legal but harmful” content such as the promotion of eating disorders and vaccine misinformation. The online safety bill will be introduced to parliament in the coming weeks.",News/Media,UK social media users could get power to block unverified accounts,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/25/uk-social-media-users-could-get-power-to-block-unverified-accounts
2/25/2022,"The Covid vaccination rollout saved 128,000 lives, inoculated more people than expected and was good value for money at £8.3bn, a major Whitehall report says. Despite its success, 3.7 million people are unvaccinated and “substantial risks” to programme’s future success remain, including the need to settle who delivers jabs in the months to come, because NHS staff already have jobs, according to the National Audit Office.  The spending watchdog praised everyone involved in the vaccine programme in England, including the taskforce ministers assembled, NHS England and what at its peak was the army of 60,000 vaccinators and 65,000 volunteers and administrative staff needed for such a huge undertaking. The taskforce, which was initially headed by Kate Bingham, secured early supplies of available vaccines and ensured supplies were maintained throughout the pandemic, it said. “The vaccine programme met stretching and unprecedented targets to offer two doses of Covid-19 vaccine to most adults in a short space of time,” the NAO said in an assessment of how the programme unfolded between its inception in 2020 to the end of October 2021. For example, by last July NHS England had achieved all its key deployment targets, including offering all adults a second dose by 19 July. “Uptake has exceeded expectations”, noted the NAO, the 87m doses administered by the end of October six times more than the number of winter flu jabs the NHS usually delivers. By early last summer 96% of people who had had the vaccine felt positively about being vaccinated. “The speed and uptake of the vaccine should be considered a real success,” said Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons public accounts committee. “Great credit is due to all those involved, including the scientists creating the vaccines, the national bodies involved in securing the doses we needed and all those administering the jabs.” NHS planners and vaccination site staff displayed “goodwill, flexibility and dedication” to ensure the number of centres needed were set up and ran smoothly, the NAO added. However, “lower vaccination rates persist in some groups”, notably those aged between 18 and 29, some people from minority ethnic backgrounds, including those of Chinese and black Caribbean origin, and also mothers-to-be, despite campaigns intended to prompt take-up among them. And although the government pledged to vaccinate most 12- to 15-year-olds by late October 2021, only 25% were jabbed by that date because of “challenges to this rollout”. The vaccination drive has cost £8.3bn in the two years since the pandemic struck, the NAO said – the first time this figure has been disclosed. Of that, £4.6bn went to the taskforce, which it spent mostly in vaccines, and the other £3.7bn on the rollout. Although 4.6m doses have been wasted, that represents just 4% of the total number made available so far and is far below the 15% to 20% wastage expected. About 1.9m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had to be written off when the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said it should not be given to those under 40 amid safety fears. The NAO warned that there was “considerable risks to the programme’s continuing success” include staffing, staff burnout and “the lack of surplus capacity in the healthcare system generally”. Ruth Rankine, director of primary care at the NHS Confederation, said: “Despite a multitude of hurdles primary care has consistently shown just how fast and agile it can be delivering 87m vaccinations in less than a year to October 2021 and a further 38m boosters this winter. This is a truly incredible achievement.”",News/World news,"England’s Covid vaccine drive good value for money at £8.3bn, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/england-covid-vaccine-drive-good-value-for-money-pounds-83bn-nao-spending-watchdog
2/25/2022,"Although it may be coincidence, someone far more observant than this column recently noticed that Southampton appear to have devised a clever, completely legal mid-game tactic that involves one of their players going down “injured” and in apparent need of medical attention between the 60th and 70th minute, at which point their teammates adjourn to the sideline to receive energy gels and tactical instruction from Ralph Hasenhüttl and his backroom team. Should it occur on Friday evening, we can but hope it won’t be the most interesting talking point to arise from their match against Norwich, but it has piqued our curiosity and is the first of our now traditional 10 things to look out for this weekend. BG  Southampton v Norwich City, Friday 8pm (all times GMT) With Liverpool otherwise engaged at Wembley, Manchester City have a chance to reopen a six-point lead at the top. In Frank Lampard they take on a former City player; the manager’s single, 2014-15 season in Manchester a forgotten coda to his long spell at Chelsea. Beating Leeds 3-0 two weeks ago lent optimism to his new Everton regime, only for last week’s 2-0 defeat at Southampton to reintroduce the Goodison gloom. Leeds conceding nine goals in their next two matches further deepened it, and all four of the teams below Everton in the table have been in better form over the past five matches. That Leeds and Brentford are on more of a slide may ease some of the nerves but Everton are in their deepest relegation trouble since the 2001-02 season when David Moyes was brought in to escape the drop. In such a situation, a wounded, motivated City feel the opposite of the ideal opponents to face. JB Everton v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm When Watford beat Manchester United 4-1 at Vicarage Road in November to bring down the guillotine on Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s spell in Old Trafford’s managerial hotseat, they sat 16th in the league, as close to eighth-placed United as they were to the bottom three with the season nearly a third of the way through. It was a turning point in both sides’ campaigns: since then only Manchester City and Liverpool have outperformed United, who have taken 29 points from 14 games, while not until last Saturday did Watford win another game, and their five points from 13 is, on a points per game basis, not far off twice as bad as Everton, the next worst-performing team in the division (0.38 v 0.63). It goes without saying that the Hornets desperately need another turning point but though Roy Hodgson has brought greater defensive organisation, he has not eliminated individual mistakes, has reduced the side’s attacking ambition, and salvation looks as distant as ever. SB Manchester United v Watford, Saturday 3pm Antonio Conte and Marcelo Bielsa have both recently admitted they are struggling to justifying their large salaries and when Leeds host Tottenham on Saturday, the game is likely to be a Derby della Despair for one of them in the event of any outcome other than a draw. While Tottenham go into the game as hot favourites, only a wild optimist would bet heavily on them to prevail despite the porousness of their hosts’ defence. While Bielsa’s future is constantly clouded in uncertainty, Friday’s press conference will reveal if his opposite number has calmed down since his very public existential crisis in the wake of midweek defeat at Burnley. As rare as the sight of elite managers falling on their swords might be, it would be massively surprising if the result of this Saturday’s lunchtime game prompted one of the Premier League’s two more impassioned leaders to decide the jig is up. BG Leeds v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm At some point during this relegation six-pointer, Christian Eriksen is expected to make his first appearance for Brentford. Almost certainly as a substitute, he will return to top-level football eight months after he suffered his cardiac arrest during Euro 2020. And the stakes will almost immediately be sky high. Brentford are crying out for a saviour, having collected just one point from a possible 21 since beating Aston Villa on 2 January. Newcastle are heading in the opposite direction, having taken 10 from a possible 12, and on last week’s visit to London had West Ham on the ropes before having to settle for a point. A win at the Community Stadium can leapfrog Eddie Howe’s team over that of Thomas Frank, who hope to have Ivan Toney back leading the line. Toney, cast aside from Newcastle during Rafael Benítez’s reign, was a scorer when the teams drew 3-3 in November, Howe’s first match in charge. JB Brentford v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm They might be ninth but last week’s defeat to Burnley was not entirely out of the blue for a Brighton side who boast only one home win in five months now. Encouragingly this weekend’s opponents, Aston Villa, have lost to Newcastle and Watford in their past two games, managing only one shot on target in each fixture, which led Steven Gerrard to this intriguing analysis last week: “We’ve had 19 shots but only managed one on target, so we haven’t worked [Watford goalkeeper] Ben Foster anywhere near enough and that falls on my shoulders. That’s on me and my staff to be more inventive and creative in the final third. We’ve got talented players in there. We’ve got internationals, Brazilians, Argentinians and England internationals. Players have got to want to get in the right areas and people have got to want to create and score. The result falls on me, I’ll take that and I’ll take the heat to protect the players but moving forward you need to be better in the final third.” Which appears to translate fairly clearly as: “It’s my fault we haven’t been more creative. Although obviously it’s the players’ fault. Just to be clear, I’ll take the blame for this, but it’s on them.” SB Brighton v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm West Ham’s wobble since the turn of the year could have been more costly: they are still four points behind fourth-placed Manchester United, but their stalled form has fans grumbling. A failure to freshen up the squad in January is likely to be costly. That Michail Antonio, Tomas Soucek and Pablo Fornals have flagged is understandable given their workload in a thin squad. As well as a Champions League place – a publicly stated target from the club’s ownership when they moved to the London Stadium in 2016 – it could cost them an extra year of Declan Rice. Wolves, Sunday’s opponents, have refreshed their squad by cashing in assets to bring in fresh talent with an efficiency not reflected in the Hammers’ tentative steps into the transfer market. And with Newcastle now also flush, the chance to top the Premier League’s middle class may already have been squandered. JB West Ham v Wolves, Sunday 2pm It’s been a little under three years since Burnley last won back-to-back-to-back Premier League matches but Sean Dyche’s men can make it three on the spin against a Crystal Palace side that have managed successive wins only once this season. That the first of those two triumphs came at Manchester City tells you all you need to know about Palace’s progress under Patrick Vieira – they are a team capable of beating the best on their day but are maddeningly inconsistent and often don’t get the results their performances deserve. The corresponding fixture at Turf Moor earlier this season was one such game, with Palace gifting Burnley a share of the points in an entertaining 3-3 draw through their inability to defend set pieces. It is a frailty Sean Dyche will look to exploit again, having seen his players score once and go close with at least two other headed opportunities from dead-ball situations against Tottenham. BG Crystal Palace v Burnley, Saturday 3pm The time when Liverpool fans would call Wembley “Anfield South” lies long in the past. Jürgen Klopp has concentrated his squad’s efforts on winning the Champions League and Premier League during his time in England, choosing to blood youth in the domestic cup competitions. Sunday’s Carabao Cup showpiece will be only the second English cup final Klopp has presided over, the last coming in February 2016, when he had been in charge for barely four months. Liverpool lost that League Cup final to Manchester City on penalties and – of Klopp’s squad that day – only Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Roberto Firmino and Divock Origi remain. The overhaul that Klopp has carried out in those six years is reflected in names such as Simon Mignolet, Nathaniel Clyne, Alberto Moreno, Mamadou Sakho, Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can, all of them decent, talented players but expendable to a manager who has transformed the club and widened their horizons. JB Chelsea v Liverpool, Sunday 4.30pm Chelsea have had 20 shots on target and scored six goals in the Premier League this calendar year; Liverpool have had 19 shots on target and scored nine goals this week. While defensively the two teams have been comparable this season (Chelsea have conceded 17 goals to Liverpool’s 19, and 76 shots on target to Liverpool’s 72) the Reds’ attack is not so much streets ahead of their opponents’ as entire motorway networks more advanced. Meanwhile Jürgen Klopp said after Wednesday’s thrashing of Leeds that in midfield “more often than not you need really fresh legs” and has been putting those words into practice – Liverpool’s two matches this week featured entirely different starting midfield threes, two of them later being substituted on each occasion. This makes it hard to guess whose legs will be freshest come Sunday but though the remainder of the team could feasibly be unchanged some kind of reshuffle here seems likely.

2/25/2022,"Rape survivors who report their attackers are being systematically failed by the criminal justice system resulting in an average wait of nearly two years before a trial begins, a damning official report has found. A joint inspection by two government watchdogs has identified multiple failings in the process from reporting a rape to a possible trial and conviction of an assailant.  A lack of collaboration between police and prosecutors has led to months of delays and poor communication with accusers, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI) said. It took an average of nearly 706 days between reporting an offence to police and the start of a criminal trial, the report said, with rape survivors facing repeated delays and cancellations. One case took 16 years to reach court due to “an apparent lack of evidence”, despite the presence of DNA at the scene. Wendy Williams, HM inspector of constabulary, and Andrew Cayley QC, HM chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Inspectorate, said the current situation for rape survivors could not continue. “Rape victims are continually and systematically failed by the criminal justice system,” they said. “We found many hardworking professionals who are dedicated to supporting victims and pursuing perpetrators, but we also found some deep divisions between the police and prosecutors which must be overcome.” The report examined 556 files from the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, evidence from interviews, and survey responses from 135 survivors and victim support services. Inspectors found that most forces and CPS areas were still listing rape cases as “floaters”, or “backers”, meaning that they could be moved or re-scheduled at the last minute, including on the day of trial. One victim told the inspectors: ““I had 21 court delays, most at 24-hours’ notice. A trial that I was told would take four days took 10 months. It was almost unendurable.” The report echoed long-held concerns that survivors often felt they were the ones being investigated or standing trial, rather than the focus being on the accused. Another survivor, whose attacker was allowed to travel abroad while he awaited trial, said: “He was out there drinking around females. He was able to go abroad on holidays. “I thought: how is it that I am here, I am financially ruined, I am severely traumatised, and barely keeping it together, and yet the system allows him to just go off and do what he wants?” The government apologised following the publication of its rape review last summer, and said it aimed to reverse its dire record on serious sexual offending, convictions for which have plummeted. Figures released earlier this year showed that in the 12 months to September 2021, only 1.3% of the 63,136 rape offences recorded by police resulted in a suspect being charged. The report made a number of recommendations, including creating either temporary or permanent specialist rape courts within the next three months to help clear the case backlog. It also suggested the police and the CPS should work together to ensure that a defendant’s “bad character” is considered in all rape cases following anecdotal evidence that prosecutors and investigators missed opportunities to present such evidence before the courts. Responding to the report, Max Hill QC, the director of public prosecutions, said he accepted the findings. “Strong collaboration between prosecutors and police is vital, and we have a strong joint commitment to improve how we work together so that we can drive up the number of rape cases we bring to court. “We are undertaking extensive work to bring about urgent change, and to improve the support given to victims – working with support services we will improve communication and better understand how we can help victims through the legal system so they can give their best evidence,” he said. Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister and justice secretary, said the government also accepted the findings. “This is a sobering and considered analysis. We accept the findings, and will look at how best to address them in the most rigorous and effective way possible. “The government is absolutely determined to give victims greater support and swifter justice – and ensure they see their attackers punished.”",News/Society,"Rape victims ‘systematically failed’ in England and Wales, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/25/victims-systematically-failed-in-england-and-wales-report-finds
2/25/2022,"Anthony McCarten’s new play is an odd bromance between two art world legends, Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Like McCarten’s The Pope (adapted into the Oscar-nominated film The Two Popes), it is based on real-life figures at ideological odds, this time in a more volatile head-to-head. Warhol recently popped up, as a familiar figure in a fright wig, in James Graham’s 1960s political drama Best of Enemies at the Young Vic. He is back on the same stage now, played by Paul Bettany in the actor’s first theatrical appearance for more than 20 years.  The story is set in the 1980s when the middle-aged pop artist and the spirited young painter collaborated on a series of works, their partnership pitched as a boxing match in its marketing poster. “He’s old hat,” says Jeremy Pope’s Basquiat. His paintings are “so ugly and angry,” says Bettany’s Warhol. Yet they are persuaded to come together, this play dramatising their first day in the studio and what appears to be their last. An ebullient production under Kwame Kwei-Armah’s direction (there is even a live DJ though, oddly, the music is only cranked up in between scenes), it has two star turns in the central performances and a spectacular set from Anna Fleischle: paint-splattered floorboards and white brick walls which recreate the look of a loft studio. Duncan McLean’s magnificent projections conjure the New York skyline on semi-diaphanous panels. The friendship between the artists is a fascinating one – far spikier than in Julian Schnabel’s 1996 biopic Basquiat – but it does not have the same quietly cumulative force as that in The Two Popes. The first half is stilted – deliberately so – but feels a little slow and static, the artists talking about the purpose of art and the meanings it holds for them. Much of this feels overfamiliar, especially Warhol’s soup tins, the commodification of art and his vision of the artist as a brand. None of it feels mined deeply enough, and exposition glares through at times: Warhol makes a quip about the shooting that nearly killed him; Basquiat tells us what his former graffiti tag, Samo, stood for. The conversation feels as familiar as the Marilyn Monroe silk-screens that hang at the back of the room and seems to tiptoe around points of conflict rather than going in with both feet. The second half is far more animated with intellectual arguments running alongside the human drama of their jagged friendship. There are several arresting moments, with a shocking plotline about a Black street artist beaten into a coma by police officers which also refers back to Basquiat’s identity as a Black American of Puerto Rican and Haitian heritage. The gulf between the first and second acts feels wide, though, and we wish for a smoother arc between the two, which might fill us in on the formation of the intense relationship we see at the end. There are gusts of rage, accusation and mistrust between them, the emotional volatility of the second act all the louder against the quiet of the first. Warhol’s objectification of Basquiat is powerfully conveyed, with all the racialised overtones – he speaks of him as a Haitian immigrant (“No, I’m an American,” says Basquiat), and calls his works “primal” (“Do you mean like a primate?” shoots back Basquiat in a line spoken in Schnabel’s biopic but better explored here). Bettany and Pope do so much more than merely ventriloquising their celebrity parts. Bettany captures Warhol’s tics – his gawkiness and gormless stares with a deadpan streak of cynicism. He is a far more rounded character than David Bowie’s amusingly eccentric Warhol in Schnabel’s film and steers clear of caricature but certainly brings humour. Pope, meanwhile, gives us a seductive, childlike free spirit in his Basquiat but remains – maybe deliberately – more of an enigma. Their collaboration is very much a story for our age of Twitter battles and irreconcilable ideological differences. Despite their charged rows, they do not stop talking or working together, and the final, touching, portrait of them is one of love.  The Collaboration is at the Young Vic, London, until 2 April.",Arts/Stage,The Collaboration review – Warhol and Basquiat mix paint and trade blows,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/25/the-collaboration-review-young-vic-london
2/25/2022,"Mikel Arteta said Alexandre Lacazette “behaves like someone who wants to stay with us” after the striker made a vital contribution to Arsenal’s dramatic late victory over Wolves. Lacazette is unlikely to be awarded the 95th-minute winner, which could be a defining one in Arsenal’s bid to reach the top four, given Wolves’ goalkeeper José Sá appeared to make a crucial diversion with his fingertips. But Arteta was full of praise for the work of his captain, who has appeared likely to leave when his contract expires this summer, and hinted the door is open for the 30-year-old to stay if he will accept a short-term deal.  “We don’t know what’s going to happen at the end of the season,” he said. “We don’t have contracts that run for 20 years, it’s part of our job. He behaves like someone who wants to stay with us. I can only praise him and try to help him as much as possible. For me it’s Lacazette’s goal.” Arteta said he had told his players at the interval that they would have to overcome adversity in order to hit their target of a Champions League place. They trailed to Hwang Hee-chan’s goal and would have been further behind if Raúl Jiménez had not missed a fine chance. “I said to them at half-time that if you want to be top in May we’re going to have to overcome results three or four times to be there,” he said. “The spirit and energy that the players put in in the second half was phenomenal.” Wolves lost a top-flight match after going ahead for the first time in 46 games and are now five points behind Arsenal, having played a game more, but Bruno Lage pronounced himself happy with their performance. “We deserved more than we got but this is football,” he said. We came here to play with our personalities. We know how to control the game with and without the ball. I’m unhappy because we lost but I’m proud of my team and what the players did.” Lage also apologised for a mix-up that saw Arsenal accuse his players of wasting time when Jiménez was mistakenly slated to be substituted instead of Daniel Podence.",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta says Alexandre Lacazette playing ‘like he wants to stay’ at Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/mikel-arteta-says-alexandre-lacazette-playing-like-he-wants-to-stay-at-arsenal
