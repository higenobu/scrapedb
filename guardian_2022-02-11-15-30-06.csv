2/11/2022," In the 90s, 16 children were taken from their families in northern Italy and placed into care. After being accused of running a paedophile ring, the parents have always maintained their innocence. This five-part documentary follows a journalist unpicking the case decades later. Were these children victims of satanic abuse, or did hysteria blur the truth? It’s a slow, sometimes salacious, burn, but everyone involved is treated with respect thanks to director Hugo Berkeley’s forensic approach.

2/11/2022,"Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán is hoping Donald Trump will travel to Budapest in the coming weeks to boost his reelection campaign. A thinktank linked to the Orbán government, the Centre for Fundamental Rights, has issued an invitation to Trump, a government source told The Guardian.  The invitation comes as Orbán moves into campaigning mode ahead of a closely fought election due on 3 April, when his Fidesz party will face a united opposition coalition, in what is seen as the biggest challenge to his rule since he became prime minister 12 years ago. “People in Fidesz would really like Trump to visit Budapest in March,” said the source, who added that Trump has not yet replied to the invite. If it happens, the visit would be Trump’s first known trip outside the US since he lost the elections in 2020. Orbán was an early Trump supporter, endorsing him as early as summer 2016, and he also publicly backed him in the 2020 vote. The pair spoke by telephone in January, and Trump returned the favour, publicly endorsing Orbán for the April election. An in-person visit by the former US president would be seen as a major campaign boost. “These visits have a huge influence in the Hungarian conservative community, because they see [Trump] as an icon, as someone who spent his presidency in a strong headwind,” said a source close to Fidesz. One former Republican staffer said Trump is known to fear contracting Covid while travelling abroad and may prefer not to travel. Trump fired Sally Yates, the acting attorney general, after she refused to enforce the Muslim-focused immigration ban. Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn after he apparently misled vice president Mike Pence over conversations he’d had with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Trump fired Preet Bharara, US attorney for New York’s Southern District, who had refused to comply with an order to resign. Katie Walsh, deputy chief of staff and a Reince Priebus ally, quit. She later said she decided to make the move after the initial failure of a Trump-backed health care bill in the House. Most notoriously, Trump fired FBI director James Comey. Initially, Trump cited Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation as the reason behind his decision. Later, Trump admitted “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia” (ie the investigation into collusion to swing the election between the president’s camp and Moscow) had been on his mind. Walter Shaub Jr., office of government ethics director, resigned over concerns that Trump’s conflicts of interest put the US at risk of being seen as a “kleptocracy”. White House press secretary Sean Spicer resigned after Anthony Scaramucci was brought in as communications director.  Trump forced out Reince Priebus as the White House chief of staff and replaced him with homeland security secretary, Gen John Kelly. White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was fired after just ten days, reportedly at the request of new White House chief of staff John Kelly and after a foul-mouthed tirade to a New Yorker journalist.  Steve Bannon, White House chief strategist, was removed from his position, leaving a major void in the administration.  Liz Harrington, chief spokesperson for Trump, did not respond to a request for comment. Asked to comment on various aspects of the invite, Orbán’s spokesman Zoltán Kovács responded with one word: “Nope.” It is likely that Trump has been invited to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), due to be held from 25-26 March in Budapest. It will be the first time a European country hosts the flagship conservative event. Miklos Szanthó, the director of the Center for Fundamental Rights, told the Hungarian news agency MTI that a number of US senators would attend the conference, as well as Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s Vox party and Jair Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo. Fidesz is hoping that Trump will join Orbán as the event’s keynote speaker, the Hungarian government source said. “According to our plans a number of high profile Americans will attend CPAC Hungary, including politicians, as well as prominent thinkers and opinion leaders on the right. We are certain that any fresh information regarding guests and speakers will reach you in due course of time,” said Szanthó. The thinktank’s mission statement says it acts as a “counter against today’s overgrown human rights fundamentalism and political correctness”. It is known for echoing the government’s communications and creating propaganda videos. According to research by the investigative Hungarian news outlet, Átlátszó, almost all of their budget is provided by grants financed from public funds. Trump and Orbán met during a 2019 White House visit, when Trump said the two men were similar: “You’re respected all over Europe. Probably a bit like me, a little bit controversial, but that’s OK”. David Cornstein, a long-time friend who Trump appointed ambassador to Hungary, said Trump admired Orbán for his strongman image and his control of the Hungarian political scene: “He would love to have the situation that Viktor Orbán has,” Cornstein said in 2019. After Trump left office, Orbán’s relations with Washington soured, and Hungary was the only EU nation not invited to Joe Biden’s recent Democracy Summit. Relations with the Trump camp have remained strong. In September, former vice-president Mike Pence spoke to a conference on conservative social values hosted by Orbán. Former attorney general Jeff Sessions was also a recent visitor. Fox News host Tucker Carlson also spent time in Hungary earlier this year, broadcasting several shows from Budapest and making a “documentary” that painted Hungary as a conservative paradise, under constant attack by the Hungarian-born billionaire, George Soros. It was Carlson’s second trip to Hungary in less than a year. Last August he travelled to Budapest to interview Orbán. A few weeks after the Hungarian PM’s appearance on Fox, Trump sent him a letter of congratulations: “Great job on Tucker, proud of you!”",News/World news,Viktor Orbán invites Trump to Hungary to boost re-election campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/donald-trump-hungary-prime-minister-viktor-orban-reelection
2/11/2022,"With laser-guided precision, with the exactitude of a Nobel-winning rocket scientist or a world-class neurosurgeon, this film measures right up to what you’d expect from a movie based on a PlayStation video game. It’s a huge greenscreen action-adventure with a reasonable bang-buck ratio, but a box office algorithm where its heart is supposed to be. It’s all about a couple of ripped guys on the trail of some lost 16th-century gold belonging to legendary explorer Ferdinand Magellan; the film cheerfully rips off Indiana Jones, the National Treasure films with Nicolas Cage, and there’s a touch of The Goonies in there somewhere. Tom Holland has been doing some serious work with his personal trainer for his role as Nathan Drake, a tough kid with serious abs and a talent for parkour that looks like it is only partly faked with a stunt double. He is now making a few bucks as a cocktail waiter but he’s also a pickpocket, ripping off rich people in the bar – and dreaming of finding Magellan’s loot, which his adored older brother once told him about before mysteriously going missing.  It’s then that Sully Sullivan (played by a detached Mark Wahlberg, who is maybe not entirely engaged with a second fiddle role) comes up to the light-fingered Nate in his bar with a proposition: a scene pinched from George Clooney meeting Matt Damon for the first time in Ocean’s Eleven. They can team up to search for the gold, and maybe find Nate’s brother, too. But in doing so, they come across some tough customers: gold hunter Chloe (Sophia Ali) and ice-cold martial arts warrior Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) who is in the pay of the smooth-voiced bad guy Moncada (Antonio Banderas). The lovable rogues bop around from glamorous location to glamorous location and the whole thing runs smoothly enough, with some spectacular touches. Holland gives it his all, but the rest of the cast look a little less committed. An efficient, soulless hologram of a film.  Uncharted is released on 11 February in the UK, 17 February in Australia and 18 February in the US.",Arts/Film,Uncharted review – Tom Holland game adaptation is action-movie by committee,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/uncharted-review-tom-holland-game-adaptation-is-action-movie-by-committee
2/11/2022,"When Robert Mark was appointed commissioner of the Metropolitan police in the 1970s he wryly suggested his ambition was to ensure the service arrested more criminals than it employed. In the five years of his leadership (1972 to 1977) Mark’s success can be measured by the 50 criminal officers he put before a court, and the nearly 500 others who were swept out of the organisation as a result of his ruthless uncovering of the entrenched and institutionalised corruption which had protected them for too long.  Last week the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, put the current commissioner Cressida Dick on notice that the behaviour of her officers was a return to the bad old days of the 70s, when corruption went hand in hand with sexism and racism as an unchallenged cultural norm within Scotland Yard. But Dick – appointed the first female commissioner in 2017 and, as our most prominent officer, the symbol for policing nationwide – never had the clarity of vision and purpose to follow Mark’s well documented example of how to effectively cleanse the rot from an organisation. Perhaps this is because to tackle such systemic problems, you have to admit they exist in the first place, something Dick singularly failed to do. Instead as commissioner, she repeatedly employed the excuse that the horrific behaviour of Metropolitan police officers was the work of the odd “bad ’un”. She never saw that the unchecked behaviour of multiple bad ’uns amounted to a culture of impunity, or that the repeated themes of violent misogyny, racism, homophobia and abuse of power in the wrongdoing of officers was a sign of a systemic problem. Dick, who was put on warning by Khan that she had days or weeks to radically alter her stance on the Met’s deep-seated problems, was unable to join the dots. In turbulent times, sound leadership, as Mark displayed, can force through radical change. But where he joined the Met police as an outsider, a senior officer from the Leicestershire constabulary, Dick is Met police through and through. Known affectionately by some as Cress, she rose to senior roles having been one of the Met rank and file, is steeped in its values and sense of exceptionalism, and ultimately imbued with unerring loyalty to her force. Scandal after scandal has rocked her organisation, and the public’s trust in her officers: the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by serving officer Wayne Couzens; the taking of photos by officers at the murder scene of two sisters; the misogyny and racism exhibited by officers at Charing Cross station, the threats to kill a female colleague made by one of those same officers; the sharing of disgusting pornography between colleagues on armed protection at Downing Street; and the signs of deep-rooted homophobia in the inept investigation into serial killer Stephen Port. But after each one, Dick has simply apologised or retreated, apparently blind to what became glaringly obvious to others: something at the core of her organisation was dark and wrong. Take her words when Couzens pleaded guilty to the kidnap, rape and murder of Everard; they were spoken from the perspective of someone whose greatest concern was the reputational damage to policing rather than a duty to protect the public. “All of us in the Met are sickened, angered and devastated by this man’s truly dreadful crimes. Everyone in policing feels betrayed,” she said. But for those outside the closed ranks of policing, it was the Met who had done the betraying and the public, in particular women, who were the betrayed. Speaking after the revelations that two male officers had taken pictures of the scene where sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry lay fatally stabbed, Dick’s apology was so heavily qualified as to be no apology at all. “If those officers’ actions have added to the family’s unimaginable distress then I apologise,” she said. The mayor of London was true to his word, when on Thursday he withdrew his support, and she was forced to resign. Her resignation came after a public statement on Thursday in which she claimed that she led Met “very well”; indeed she believed she had already transformed the force and maintained the trust of the rank and file. As the search begins for her successor, there are lessons to learn in examining what Dick never did in the face of the repeated impropriety, abuse of power and at times criminal wrongdoing of some of her officers. She should have publicly admitted there was a problem with the whole culture of the force, clearly identified the standards her officers must adhere to, and then made sure they were enforced ruthlessly and comprehensively, all the time. Sir Paul Stephenson, commissioner from 2009 to 2011, used to say “intrusive supervision” of his officers was required to ensure they upheld standards and avoided corrupt behaviour. And after the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, Sir Ian Blair, another former commissioner, said Met police officers needed to show real humility and willingness to change if they were to build new credibility with the public. But that humility and willingness to change never came from Dick, who only recently was spending public money denying there was a systemic problem of prejudice within her organisation Lawyers for the Met argued successfully in December at the inquest into the four young gay men murdered by Port that the issue of homophobic prejudice should not be considered by the jury. The lawyers said the mistakes were explained by “forgetfulness, indolence, lack of training, stress, overwork or inadequate supervision and management” – not prejudice. Nothing in the Met’s behaviour, as it was rocked by more and more shocking revelations, suggested Dick ever understood the need for transparent and honest scrutiny of her force in order to tackle its cultural problems. Instead, Dick’s approach was to play down events and keep things quiet. At gross misconduct disciplinary hearings for two of the Charing Cross officers, the men were given anonymity, even though one of them had been the subject of a criminal conviction for threatening to murder a female colleague. No transparency there. Mark is remembered because he displayed an uncompromising boldness of thought that put the public first in his cleansing of the Met of the 1970s; he did not resort to sticking-plaster solutions when it was abundantly clear the requirement was major surgery. These times called for similar decisiveness. But Dick never rose to the task, and, unendingly loyal to her beloved Met, was not willing to face the turbulence and resentments which would have been provoked by taking on the malign culture within it. Where Dick failed, there is a desperate need now for someone, perhaps an individual with the dispassionate and fearless eye of an outsider, to succeed.

2/11/2022,"The clear blue skies of the first lockdown are being crisscrossed by contrails once again. These white lines are caused by ice crystals that form on the huge numbers of tiny, ultrafine particles that come from aircraft engines. Ultrafine particles are far smaller than the wavelength of light, but contrails are a rare example of them being made visible. Ultrafine particles are not just a problem in the skies above us. Airports are a large source, and my latest research has been searching for these tiny particles close to Gatwick. They were not hard to find. The number of ultrafine particles 500 metres downwind of the airport was greater than those at the kerb of London’s busiest roads. They mostly came from aircraft during takeoff and landing, but traffic, car parks and a large catering facility used to cook airline food all added to the problem.  In 2021, the Dutch Health Council and the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the growing evidence that ultrafine particles are damaging our health. This includes 75 studies; mostly relating to lung inflammation, blood pressure and heart problems, along with risks to foetal growth. However, technical differences between the studies meant that the WHO has not set a standard. We are yet to understand the spread of ultrafine particles from Gatwick, but we do know they can travel a long way. Ultrafine particles from aircraft have been found across the Los Angeles suburbs. We have found ultrafine particles from Heathrow across large areas of west London, and they can be detected more than 12 miles (20km) away in the city centre. It is a similar situation in several European cities, meaning millions of people are exposed. More than 10 years ago I was part of a study that found day to day changes in ultrafine particles in London matched the number of people dying or going to hospital with heart problems. Since then, I have tracked reductions in ultrafine particles in our cities as a side-effect of regulations to tackle other air pollutants. These include removing sulphur impurities from diesel fuel and requiring particle filters on the exhausts of new vehicles. Researchers have suggested that sulphur is removed from aircraft fuel too, to match the tight limits on sulphur in diesel and petrol. This would be a possible solution for ultrafine particles. In the meantime, Bristol airport’s expansion was approved earlier this month and Gatwick is applying to increase capacity by bringing its emergency runway into regular use. Ultrafine particles are not included in the environmental assessments, putting us at risk of increased air pollution for decades to come.",News/Environment,Pollutionwatch: ultrafine particles from aircraft engines endanger lives,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/pollutionwatch-ultrafine-particles-from-aircraft-engines-endanger-lives
2/11/2022,"Café Society, New York City, early 1939The 23-year-old Billie Holiday was mostly unknown outside the jazz loop when she began her 1939 residency at this liberal New York club. Her understated, delicately implacable debut of Strange Fruit, a terrifying depiction of lynchings in the south, made a unique new vocal sound famous worldwide. John Fordham  Minton’s Playhouse, New York City, 1941Rising young originals such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and the guitarist Charlie Christian lived off commercial swing gigs in 1941, but they forged the revolutionary modern jazz style called bebop in tumultuous after-hours Harlem jam sessions, where Thelonious Monk and the drums innovator Kenny Clarke were in the house band. JF UK tour, March 1958Britain had never seen a rock band before March 1958. Then, for 25 consecutive nights, came the first true rock band – two guitars, bass and drums, a revolution in horn-rimmed specs. A schoolboy Keith Richards caught a London show, but many more future stars would see Buddy Holly on TV during his visit, when he appeared on Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Michael Hann Carnegie Hall, New York City, 23 April 1961Forty years into her career, Garland’s lavish performance to a star-studded audience is often regarded as the greatest night in showbiz history. Through a combination of vocal prowess and self-deprecation, she set the bar for concert orchestra performance. The recording made Garland the first woman to win the Grammy for album of the year. Laura Barton Whalley Range, Manchester, 7 May 1964It was the brilliant idea of the Granada TV producer Johnnie Hamp to film a selection of blues greats in south Manchester’s derelict Wilbraham Road railway station, mocked up to looked like the deep south, with “wanted” posters, washtubs and even goats and chickens. About 200 people arrived by rail to see the Gospel and Blues Train: Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, Cousin Joe, Otis Spann and the duo Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee giving intense performances on the platform. Waters was mobbed by blues-mad youngsters. Tharpe arrived in a pony and trap and seized the opportunity presented by a Mancunian downpour to strap on an electric guitar and launch spontaneously into Didn’t It Rain? Countless musicians, including Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, subsequently told Hamp they were influenced by the show, which broadcast to millions and was instrumental in taking the blues explosion to the mainstream. Dave Simpson Newport folk festival, Rhode Island, 25 July 1965It was a Sunburst Fender Stratocaster that stole the show at Newport in 1965. Dylan’s decision to play an electric guitar on a largely acoustic bill stunned the crowd, with many booing and jeering. Audiences for his world tour were similarly polarised, one disgruntled heckler in Manchester yelling: “Judas!” at the former folk hero. Essentially, it was the birth of folk rock – the real-time expansion of a genre. Laura Barton Franklin & Marshall College, Pennsylvania, 1966A show in a college gym was the breakthrough that made arena rock possible. The PA system supplied by the Clair brothers so impressed Valli that he took them on tour as his personal sound engineers. Other artists noticed the quality and soon they were in demand. Their sound systems spurred rock’s spread to the big halls. MH The Dom, New York City, 7 April 1966A former Polish wedding hall hosted the birth of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. Andy Warhol showed films and worked the lights, his “superstars” danced and the Velvet Underground played at a volume witnesses tended to describe in terms of violence: rock music as envelopment and sensory assault. AP Candlestick Park, San Francisco, 29 August 1966The Beatles’ final real gig wasn’t a great show. The stadium was half-empty, the band at the end of their tether, struggling to recreate the sound of their latest recordings. But it represented a shift in rock music: no more Beatles gigs meant more time in the studio – and albums that would change everything, again. Laura Snapes Alexandra Palace, London, 29 April 1967British counterculture’s coming-out ball. Every one of the country’s psychedelic luminaries played – Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, Tomorrow and the Pretty Things among them. Performance art was provided by Yoko Ono, while the sense that the audience was as much part of the spectacle as the artists presaged 80s rave culture. AP Monterey pop festival, California, 17 June 1967Arriving at Monterey with a lesser-known San Francisco psychedelic bluesy rock band, 24-year-old Janis Joplin gleefully demolished every stereotype of the “demure” female singer. The hard-living, hard-rocking Texan’s raucous, gut-wrenching performance attracted international attention and has been described as one of the greatest ever. DS Philadelphia College of Art, 17 November 1967Not the birth of minimalism, but certainly its breakthrough. Riley’s eight-hour set of tape manipulation and organ pulses, played to an audience seated on hammocks and cushions, generated an early recording of his classic Poppy Nogood and set the pace for electronic experimentalism in chill-out environments decades ahead. Joe Muggs Boston Garden, 5 April 1968The night after the assassination of Martin Luther King, violent protests spread across many US cities. In Boston, Brown’s show was almost cancelled for fear it might become a hotspot for public outcry. Instead, the show was repurposed: broadcast live on TV and radio in an effort to ease the grief and tension. Fans climbed on stage as he sang I Can’t Stand Myself (When You Touch Me); police officers rallied. Brown paused the song. “I’ll be fine,” he told the officers, then turned to the stage invaders: “You’re not being fair to yourselves and me, or your race. Now, I asked the police to step back, because I think I can get some respect from my own people … Are we together or we ain’t?” The crowd cheered. The fans climbed down. Brown turned to the drummer: “Hit that thing, man.” Laura Barton Harlem cultural festival, New York City, 13 July 1969Effectively buried until the 2021 documentary Summer of Soul resurrected its memory, the 1969 Harlem cultural festival was possibly the greatest selection of black talent ever assembled, from Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder to Nina Simone. If you had to pick a highlight, Mahalia Jackson and Mavis Staples’ charged performance of Take My Hand, Precious Lord might be it. AP Woodstock festival, New York, 18 August 1969Often cited as the gig that defined the 60s, the countercultural festival attracted half a million people to upstate New York. Hendrix’s deconstruction of The Star-Spangled Banner was interpreted as a protest at the Vietnam war, while “three days of peace and love” showed that people power could change history. DS The University of Leeds, 14 February 1970A blue English Heritage plaque outside the university’s refectory now honours the site of the incendiary live performance of the post-Tommy, Keith Moon-era Who captured on Live at Leeds, often cited as the greatest live rock album. DS The Troubadour, Los Angeles, 25 August 1970Not quite overnight success, but close: Elton John walked on to the stage of a celebrity-packed Troubadour a largely unknown British singer-songwriter, and walked off it a star. Aside from the music, a backstage decision to wear an outrageous outfit and a burst of energetic showmanship midway through the gig helped: two lessons he has never forgotten. AP Cook County jail, 10 September 1970Two years after Johnny Cash’s turn at Folsom prison, the blues legend King performed in Chicago to an audience of 2,000 prisoners, mostly young and black. A subsequent live album highlighted the dire conditions at the jail, helping bring about prison reform, which became a lifelong cause for King. Laura Barton Fillmore West concert hall, San Francisco, 5-7 March 1971Franklin’s appearance at Fillmore West wasn’t a star-making performance – she was already very much a star – but it featured the Queen of Soul at the peak of her powers, actively seeking to build a bridge to a post-hippy audience, covering Stephen Stills, Bread and the Beatles. Judging by the crowd’s reaction, it worked. AP Hammersmith Odeon, London, 3 July 1973The moment when David Bowie appears to announce his retirement during this show is astonishing: the crowd’s screams become a vast howl of disappointment, peppered with yells of “No!” Did he mean it? Obviously not: even if he was just announcing the end of the Ziggy Stardust era, why was he on stage at the Marquee Club in London in full Ziggy drag three months later? It didn’t matter. The announcement – before a crowd so febrile that, according to one eyewitness, audience members were pleasuring themselves as he played – wasn’t just a guaranteed headline, but an extraordinary piece of staging, an act that left everyone racing to catch up: very Bowie. It is hard not to wonder if he had it in mind when he was dying, too: the way he seemed to stage-manage his passing was all those things as well. AP The Lyceum, London, 17-18 July 1975Probably the most dynamic and exhilarating reggae concerts ever. Perhaps more importantly, the presentation was familiar enough to the rock establishment to allow them to feel comfortable with roots reggae. The album recorded at these shows put Marley on the path to global superstardom. Lloyd Bradley Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco, 25 November 1976This Thanksgiving Day show was billed as the Band’s “farewell concert appearance”. Across its remarkable five hours, they were joined by many of their contemporaries, including Bob Dylan, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell – jamming, improvising and high-kicking through an astonishing display of musicianship and camaraderie. The show was later released as a seminal documentary by Martin Scorsese. Laura Barton River Thames, 7 June 1977Insurrectionary publicity stunts don’t come better than punk’s prime movers playing on a boat sailing past the Houses of Parliament during the Queen’s silver jubilee celebrations. Their manager, Malcolm McLaren, was among those arrested. Moral pandemonium ensued as God Save the Queen shot to No 2. Or was it really No 1? DS The Rainbow theatre, London, 26 October 1977When Winston Rodney came out on stage, raised his arms and asked: “Do you remember the days of slavery?” the “Yes!” from the 3,000-strong, almost entirely black crowd nearly raised the roof. It set the tone for an evening that reclaimed roots reggae for its primary audience. Lloyd Bradley Sheffield City Hall, 16 May 1978No one hails Black Sabbath’s final UK tour with Ozzy Osbourne. What they remember is the support band. An old, tired, bloated Sabbath were destroyed night after night by Van Halen, who showed the future of hard rock – sunny, exciting, glamorous. Here was generational change embodied in the time it took for one gig to unfold. MH Tour of Life, April-May 1979Notable for being Bush’s only live tour (until 35 years later, when she made her surprise live return with the After the Dawn residency), these dates set in motion a straight line from Bush to Britney Spears and beyond. Intent on singing and dancing (fully choreographed) at the same time, Bush pioneered the invention of the head mic (hers fashioned from a coat hanger) and the modern pop show was born. LS 2 Tone tour, autumn 1979Named after Jerry Dammers’ Coventry label and kicking off in Brighton, the 2 Tone tour unleashed the Specials, Madness and the Selecter on 40 UK dates, a blur of legs, arms and adrenaline. Scenes of euphoric dancing ensued as black and white youth came together to celebrate a chart-conquering, multicultural pop phenomenon. DS Lesotho, 28 December 1980In South Africa’s apartheid era, the tyrannically segregationist laws of the country’s white government forced many black African artists into exile. The singer and campaigner Miriam Makeba and the jazz trumpeter and composer Hugh Masekela were international stars who hadn’t seen family or home for 20 years when the businessman and fan Victor Maloi funded a defiant comeback on their oppressors’ doorstep. In Lesotho, at Christmas time in 1980, a stadium crowd of 75,000 – with thousands more thronging into the tiny country’s streets to share the vibe – attended a historic event. The artists could behold their homeland from the stage – on which Masekela was reunited with his 90-year-old grandmother. A jubilant and political setlist included Makeba’s The Healing Song and Soweto Blues (“Just a little atrocity / Deep in the city”) and the churning, train-mimicking migrant workers’ lament Stimela, a Masekela concert staple for the rest of his life. JF Computer World tour, 1981This world tour offered a glimpse into the future, combining purely electronic pop and visual technology. The band synchronised films to their music, played handheld miniature keyboards during Pocket Calculator and performed Robots alongside identically dressed humanoid replicas of themselves. DS Central Park, New York City, 21 July 1983Sometimes everything going wrong can turn a gig into a memorable event, as when torrential rain broke out just after Ross took the stage here. She battled on for 45 minutes while the audience surged and fought among themselves. Probably better experienced on screen than in person, a rain-lashed Ross belting out Ain’t No Mountain High Enough is quite a sight. AP The Haçienda, Manchester, 28 October 1983Four years after Rapper’s Delight, hip-hop was still alien to most UK kids. So, seeing breaking, body-popping rappers Whodini – then superstars, yet barely out of their teens – in the flesh was transformational. Playing at the electro evangelist Greg Wilson’s night, they were true cultural ambassadors. JM Workers’ gymnasium, Beijing, 7 April 1985For the Chinese government, the first visit by a western group signalled its willingness to open its commerce to capitalism. But it made a different kind of impact: Rose Tang, who was at Tiananmen Square in 1989, later said that seeing Wham! made young Chinese people realise that rebellion was possible. MH Wembley stadium, London, 13 July 1985Almost every major rock act played Bob Geldof’s “global jukebox”, held simultaneously in Wembley and John F Kennedy stadium in Philadelphia and broadcast to a billion people. Raising millions for famine relief, it created a new generation of superstars as Queen and U2’s epic performances ushered in the era of the mega rock event – and enshrined the white saviour act. DS Hammersmith Odeon, 1 November 1987Public Enemy weren’t even the headliners of the Def Jam package tour, but when their performance at Hammersmith was played on the BBC’s A Fresh Start to the Week, it was a revelation. Armed paramilitaries on stage? What?! Bring the Noise, played months before it was released, was hip-hop as no one in Britain had heard it. MH Synergy tour, 1989-91Fearless psychotropic explorers, the Shamen turned their tour into an acid house club on wheels. Featuring live sets from Irresistible Force (AKA Mixmaster Morris), Meat Beat Manifesto and newbies Orbital, it was the seed from which 90s arena dance – Leftfield, Underworld et al – grew. JM Blond Ambition tour, April-August 1990Touring her fourth album, Like a Prayer, Madonna altered the blueprint for modern pop shows with this combination of narrative, choreography, high production values and fashion. That it was also a taboo-busting exploration of sexuality and religion only solidified its legacy: she nearly got arrested in Toronto for simulating masturbation, while Pope John Paul II called it “one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity”. Alim Kheraj Reading festival, 30 August 1992Bands being pelted by objects is common at Reading – less so is bands fighting back, as L7 did in spectacular fashion. Donita Sparks hoicked out her tampon and hurled it at the crowd, proving that long-patronised “women in rock” weren’t going to be underestimated any more. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Woodstock festival, New York, 23 July 1999This performance to an infinite sea of boiling bros showed how far hip-hop had crossed over into white middle America – and how much the white artists on the bill borrowing from it still had to learn. Even on YouTube footage, DMX’s throaty holler remains singular and gorgeous. BBT Sidewinder, Milton Keynes, 9 November 2002Although grime wasn’t even accepted as a term in 2002, the sound was fully formed. Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Flowdan and Jamakabi, plus DJs and the singer Gemma Fox, managed only 20 minutes of their allotted hour before things got too rowdy and the show was cut, but the energy echoed for years. JM Shepherd’s Bush Empire, London, 10 March 2003Natalie Maines’ onstage criticism of George W Bush’s decision to invade Iraq got country music’s most successful women blacklisted by radio stations, dropped by sponsors and subjected to death threats. Nevertheless, the band – now the Chicks – paved the way for more outspoken female country artists, from Taylor Swift to Miranda Lambert. Laura Barton A New Day residency, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, 25 March 2003It was Liberace who invented the Vegas residency and Dion (DiMucci) who revived it, but it was Céline Dion who turned Caesars into the stage for a glorious pop comeback. Her initial five-year run was followed by a further eight years – and prompted copycat turns by Britney Spears, Pink and Katy Perry. Laura Barton Bluebird Cafe, Nashville, 4 November 2004Swift played three songs at the bijou Nashville institution aged 14 and was spotted there by her future label boss (and future foe) Scott Borchetta. By no means the only artist to get discovered at the venue, she was the first to blow that coffee-shop intimacy stadium-sized, addressing thousands of fans as if they were friends sharing hot chocolates in between her glittering country-pop hits. LS Coachella festival, California, 29 April 2006Despite the best efforts of umpteen DJs and performers, dance music remained an underground phenomenon in the US until Daft Punk arrived at Coachella. Their rapturously received audiovisual extravaganza begat the American EDM explosion, a topic on which Daft Punk remained tight-lipped until the end. AP Super Bowl half-time show, Miami, 4 February 2007Any number of shows from Prince’s later years could make this list – his O2 residency, his Hit and Run guerrilla gigs – but for sheer “I’m back” bravado, his rain-soaked Super Bowl performance wins. His recording career had faltered, but this astonishing display of hits, guitar pyrotechnics and unexpected covers offered a very public reassertion of his genius. AP Glastonbury festival, Somerset, 29 June 2008Noel Gallagher should have known better than to underestimate the showmanship of rap’s No 1 superstar. He had led a pre-festival chorus of opinion that hip-hop wasn’t meant for Glastonbury; Jay-Z responded with a sarky cover of Wonderwall and an arsenal of anthems, cementing rap in mainstream British culture. BBT One Love Manchester, Old Trafford cricket ground, 4 June 2017Has a pop star ever exhibited such fortitude? Less than two weeks after the bombing at the singer’s Manchester Arena show that killed 22 people and injured hundreds more, Grande performed for a 50,000-strong crowd and became a symbol of bravery. She had planned a sombre setlist in respect of the victims, but a conversation with the mother of the 15-year-old victim Olivia Campbell led the singer to scrap it: “She told me that Olivia would have wanted to hear the hits,” Grande said on stage – so that is what she delivered. It transformed a moment of tragedy into an opportunity for defiance. Joined by big names such as Justin Bieber, Katy Perry and Liam Gallagher, Grande and the crowd danced, sang, laughed and cried through their grief. “This evening has been so light and so filled with fun and love and bright energy,” Grande said, summarising what made One Love Manchester a unique act of resistance. AK Melodrama tour, September 2017-November 2018The euphoric world tour for Lorde’s second album featured a floating room designed by Es Devlin in which the New Zealand singer and dancers acted out the drama of a house party. Months later, Lorde accused Kanye West and Kid Cudi of stealing her stage design. They denied it; meanwhile Devlin expressed her interest that both acts were “responding to our disjointed times”. A symbol for this era of precarious pop. LS Coachella festival, California, 14 April 2018This spectacular feat of artistic and musical ingenuity disrupted and decolonised homogenous modern festival culture. Drawing on the traditions of historically black colleges and universities, black feminism and a reverence and sense of restitution for Beyoncé’s black musical forebears, it redefined the festival headline set. AK Glastonbury festival, Somerset, 28 June 2019The most potent moment of this set – a grand production featuring BMX bikers, ticker tape and a ballet interlude – was probably when Stormzy recited a list of 52 British MCs, charting the breadth of homegrown rap. His platforming of the scene was modest and generous, but Stormzy’s statuesque performance was its own form of evangelism. BBT American Airlines arena, Miami, 9 March 2020On the first night of her world tour (which was curtailed by the pandemic days later), Eilish unveiled the Not My Responsibility video, in which she rejected the toxic narrative surrounding her body image. It showed gutsy self-assurance to implicate her audience and say: I am not yours. This pointed separation of church and state broke the generations-old contract between teen stars and their spectators and exemplified Eilish’s self-preservation-first interpretation of pop stardom.

2/11/2022,"MPs not fully behind net zero are “a small minority” and the government should stay committed to its goal, a cross-party group of parliamentarians has said. Chairs of eight all-party parliamentary groups, including on climate change, net zero, clean air and fuel poverty, have written a letter to the Guardian , vowing they will “continue to support and promote ambitious environmental leadership in parliament”.  This week, the Guardian reported that the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of 19 Conservatives was accused of attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, linking it to the cost-of-living crisis and leading to fears of a “culture war” campaign around net zero. The signatories to the letter, which include the Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire, Anthony Browne, chair of the Environment APPG; the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, chair of the Sustainable Finance APPG; and the Labour peer Lady Hayman, co-chair of Peers for the Planet, write that they hope to “reassure your readers and the public that parliamentarians who are not fully behind net zero are a small minority”. “We recognise the environment is now a top concern of the British public. And we recognise the spiralling climate crisis and the urgent need to transition to a more sustainable economy. “There are different approaches to reach net zero, but we all support the goal. Delaying action will cost the country more,” they write. The NZSG group, which has gained widespread media coverage in the past month despite being small in number, says it does not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise. It has called for cuts to green taxes and an increase in fossil fuel production to address the energy crisis. Two leading members have links to an organisation often described as “climate-sceptic”, and the group’s chair has been accused by a leading climate institute of using misleading and inaccurate information. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said he believed the NZSG was “ignoring reality” and that a weak and divided government was unlikely to fight climate change to the best of its ability. He told the Guardian: “The best way to avoid continued exposure to fossil fuel price crises like the one we are currently facing is to go further and faster in the green transition. “Yet a section of the Conservative party questions this reality and the danger is a weak and divided government doesn’t take the action we need. “The problem is that we already have a government of climate delay, which by failing to take the necessary action on everything from energy efficiency to the deployment of onshore wind has left us more vulnerable as a country. “Now it refuses to support a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies who are making record profits during the energy crisis, whilst the British people face rocketing energy bills.” The Green party MP and chair of the Climate Change APPG, Caroline Lucas, cautioned that the NZSG could have undue influence on No 10, especially as Boris Johnson is weakened by scandals. Lucas, who also signed the letter, told the Guardian: “Johnson will do whatever he thinks is necessary to stay in office, including dumping climate pledges if it will buy him support from rightwing Tory MPs. He’s not only sacrificing the climate and the UK’s reputation, he’s also ditching the best way of keeping people warm and getting bills down.” James Murray, an environmental commentator and editor at Business Green, said: “If the Net Zero Scrutiny Group and its supporters are really concerned about climate change the onus is on them to set out a credible alternative plan for tackling it. “The challenge for supporters of the net zero transition is to highlight how decarbonisation is essential for tackling the climate crisis, while also addressing the specific and legitimate concerns around some of the short-term costs associated with transition that its opponents seek to exploit. It’s vital to show, for example, the huge financial and health benefits that come from energy efficiency upgrades and low-cost clean technologies and renewables. Done right, net zero can make MPs’ constituents richer and warmer.”",News/Environment,"Tory group fighting net zero ‘a small minority’, say parliamentarians",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/tory-group-fighting-net-zero-a-small-minority-say-parliamentarians
2/11/2022,"It will be “really disappointing” if the Scottish parliament cannot attract more female politicians within the next five years, says Holyrood’s presiding officer, as she launches Holyrood’s first women’s audit to investigate barriers to representation and participation. Alison Johnstone, the former Scottish Green politician who was elected last May to the position of presiding officer – the Holyrood equivalent of the Commons speaker – also suggests that political parties are falling short in selecting female candidates. She signals that the hybrid working arrangements used during lockdown and which suited working women in particular could become permanent.  Although last May’s elections returned the most diverse MSP group ever – 58 women, making up 45% of the parliament, including the first two minority-ethnic women – three female MSPs stood down, citing the difficulties of managing family life and their role. Holyrood has no formal pairing system or proxy votes, for example. Launching the audit plans, which will be led by a cross-party board of MSPs and academics, Johnstone pointedly describes the progress as “unexpected” given Holyrood had been sitting at 35% the previous session, and makes it clear political parties must play their part. All parties, she says, “are beginning to realise the absolute necessity of making sure they have fair representation … They are getting better at it but we’re still not seeing it deliver a 50:50 parliament”. She knows “fabulously able women” who have decided not to get involved in party politics because of their caring commitments. “It’s not just about getting to the party meetings,” says Johnstone bluntly. “It’s about hanging about afterwards to mill around in a bar and getting to know activists who will support you when you need their votes to be selected.” All parties currently represented in Holyrood, aside from the Scottish Conservatives, have used all-women shortlists with varying degrees of success. Johnstone, who has been robust in her rebukes of MSPs for rude or disrespectful behaviour – including the first minister – is clearly mindful of the combative tone in the Holyrood chamber, a space originally designed in amphitheatre style to avoid the confrontations of the Commons. She is adamant that MSPs from all backgrounds should “feel comfortable representing their constituents to the best of their ability”, and reveals that the parliament has already started work compiling statistics on contributions in the chamber. “I’m really keen to see who is making the vast majority of interventions, who is more comfortable doing that and why?” As her women’s audit begins, Holyrood’s procedures and public appointment’s committee is carrying out its own review of the remote working practices used during the pandemic, and Johnstone insists the two are “very much connected” and says she expects Holyrood will adopt some hybrid working opportunities permanently. Taking into account caring responsibilities and those candidates representing large rural areas, “travelling into a building might not be the best use of parliamentarian’s time”. The culture around politics has changed significantly, she acknowledges: the “toxic” social media discourse, which women bear the brunt of, puts many off. The mob attack on Keir Starmer earlier this week was “deeply troubling and uncomfortable”, she says, and the direct result of how a politician’s tone plays through into the general culture.",News/Politics,Scotland launches women’s audit to look at barriers to entering Holyrood,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/11/scotland-launches-womens-audit-to-look-at-barriers-to-holyrood-alison-johnstone
2/11/2022,"The Trojan Horse AffairThis Serial-backed podcast tackles the scandal that saw Birmingham schools accused of an Islamist plot. Given the affair stemmed from authorities being sent an amateurish-looking letter that was supposedly correspondence between Muslims plotting to take control of schools, it asks: who wrote it? The storytelling is as hooky as you’d expect, given it was part created by S-Town’s Brian Reed. Alexi Duggins  In Touch With Ruby RareSex podcasts can all too often edge towards giggly chats masquerading as insight. That’s not the case with this informed documentary series from sex educator Ruby Rare, which manages to feel light and fun despite bringing a considered critical eye to topics including kink, nudity and Britain’s problem with offering good sex education. AD Shaun Keaveny’s Creative Cul-De-SacThe trademark Keaveny warmth is in full flow in his new podcast about those ideas that may be better left in an abandoned notebook. He has a cracking lineup picking out their forgotten creative gems, including Vic Reeves, Nina Conti and Tim Key, plus there’s a look at his own ideas that didn’t make the cut. Hannah Verdier And Just Like That … The Writers Room“Do you know how hard it is to create a water-cooler moment when no one is even in the office?” Little did writer and director Michael Patrick King know how much debate his Sex and the City sequel would create. In this series, he speaks to co-writers on the show about the divisive decisions they made. Hollie Richardson Chameleon: Wild BoysJournalist Sam Mullins remembers the moment he heard about two emaciated, nigh-on feral “bush boys” who landed in his small Canadian home town of Vernon. “When the boys admitted that they weren’t as ‘bush’ as they originally let on, the media attention fell off a cliff,” he says, unreeling a yarn that becomes more bizarre with every instalment. HV Chosen by Joel Grove Listeners of the Guardian’s very own Football Weekly podcast will be familiar with the dulcet tones of regular contributor and Gareth Bale enthusiast Elis James. However, Football Weekly only accounts for around a mere 2% of Elis’ prolific podcast output. The best of which (to my mind) is The Socially Distant Sports Bar. Initially launched in the first lockdown, Sports Bar is now approaching it’s 100th episode. The premise is straightforward enough: James and fellow comedian Mike Bubbins, along with presenter and ship steadier Stephen Garrerro, each come armed with two clips linked to sport, ranging from the diets of Britain’s strongmen to Kaká turning out for a five-a-side team. When it comes to episode duration the prevailing wisdom in podcasting is that there is some sort of mythical sweet spot somewhere between 40-50 minutes, but this show laughs in the face of convention. While a two hour 30 minute runtime might be daunting for a first-time listener, it somehow never outstays its welcome. A recent tangent about the Gold Blend Nescafe adverts had me doubled over on the train home – it’s in these moments that Sports Bar is at its very best. Come for the sport, stay for the anecdote about gifting a camping stove to an optician.

2/11/2022,"My body is an accordion. Not because it sounds horrible. I mean, it does. It clicks and cracks and honks, and when I try to sing nicely my son screams from the pit of his soul, like I’ve brandished an axe. No, what I mean is, it’s like an accordion because, for 32 years I was squeezing her in. In and in, for a half-life. On a BMI chart, I’ve always been “obese” – technically, ill. So for decades I saw my body as defective, disappointing and disgusting. If I looked at it, I felt the kind of hatred and repulsion I normally reserve for racists or people who say “hashtag justsayin’” out loud.  From age nine to 32, I adhered to every type of diet. I didn’t miss out the one you think would shrink me; I did that one, too. Several times. I lived in a cycle of starvation, control and obsession, followed by bingeing and sometimes purging. That’s what serial dieting is: disordered eating lite. Then, bang! An explosion of change. I got pregnant with my son, and my physical metamorphosis cast a spell. Suddenly, my bigness had a purpose and I felt like a king: invincible, glorious. I stripped in swimming pool changing rooms without a single care, like a thin person or a Spanish person, or a man. It felt delicious. It didn’t last, but it had sown a beautiful seed in me. Not of self-love or self-worship – I don’t believe such perfectionistic grandeur is necessary or useful, or sometimes even honest – but of gratitude and acceptance. The possibility of seeing some beauty in my body just as it is, at any given time. Many things happened over the next two years to compound this feeling. Firstly, I discovered weightlifting, which brought me joy and power and had fuck all to do with losing weight. In fact, I grew and continue to grow brilliant muscles. I also discovered a burgeoning, freeing pansexuality smashing its way into my formerly heterosexual life. Lastly, and surely not by complete coincidence, I underwent a complete reeducation about food and eating. I discovered the incredible Intuitive Eating and Health at Every Size movements. I found big, beautiful bodies being proud on Instagram. I had some good therapy. I host a podcast about eating and, fewer than 50 guests in, I realised that virtually every woman I spoke to had, at some point, made themselves sick. To be thinner. The normality of it slapped me; the universality of it as a female experience. I realised that millions of women, like me, were trapped in misery by a lie that has been woven into our DNA for generations: the value of thinness. Because miserable women are quiet and cowed and, best of all, we’ll buy anything you promise will fix us. Well, my eyes are open now. And my wallet is closed. I’ll take this body in a large, bitches. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not immune to the noise that suggests my body is better when it’s smaller, but I am the happiest and the healthiest that I have ever been. I’m really fit and really strong, and I eat many varied and wonderful nutritious foods. I’m slowly, lovingly, filling her back up. This accordion. Hearing her sigh. Stretching her, yes. Growing her. And I cannot believe that, in 2022, it still feels transgressive to glory in that.

2/11/2022,"Rick Rubin, founder of Def Jam Records and the most highly regarded music producer of his time, has announced his first book. The Creative Act: A Way of Being is a non-fiction work about creativity. “I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art,” said Rubin in a statement. “Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be.”  UK publisher Canongate describes The Creative Act as Rubin’s distillation of “the principles of creativity for creators of all kinds, including people in their everyday lives” and said it gives “revelatory insight into the mysterious process of making stuff great”. Given Rubin’s decades-long and undimmed creative prowess – and going by the proliferation of inspirational Rubin quotes shared online – his advice carries significant weight. He founded Def Jam Records as a teenager, which would become one of the most influential labels of all time after he joined forces with Russell Simmons in the mid 80s and released music by the likes of LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, Slayer and Public Enemy. That decade, Rubin worked as a producer for the stars of the nascent New York City rap scene as well as for heavy rock acts, and often brought the once-disparate genres together to history-changing effect. In 1986 alone, he produced Run-DMC’s Raising Hell, Slayer’s Reign in Blood, Beastie Boys’ Licensed to Ill and Original Concept’s Can You Feel It. “The punk rock and hip-hop trajectories were somewhat similar: both were being made by young people without virtuoso skill, and both were about ideas more than musicianship,” Rubin told the Guardian last year. “They were edgy and frowned upon by anyone who wasn’t part of the respective scenes.” By the 90s, the Rubin touch spread beyond his already broad church. He worked frequently with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as well as Mick Jagger, Tom Petty and the Spice Girls’ Mel C, and began a collaboration with Johnny Cash that would revive the ageing country star’s career and continue until his death in 2003. With every decade, Rubin’s influence reached further: to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Limp Bizkit and the Chicks in the 2000s, to Adele, Lana Del Rey and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, in the 2010s. “I really like the challenge of working with different kinds of music,” he told Interview magazine in 2010. “I feel like my role is really like a coach, so I feel like I can do my job for different kinds of music that may not necessarily be what I listen to.” In a celebration of the producer’s career published in 2020, the Ringer critic Rob Harvilla described Rubin, who often appears to approach production as a kind of existential state, as “a man with nothing but time, a slovenly mystic who regards time [and producing] as a construct. “Studio footage of this person doing his thing is endlessly rewarding, especially when the thing he is doing is an endless and somehow profound amount of nothing.” From 2007 to 2013, Rubin was co-head of Columbia Records, overseeing its transition into the digital era. He has won nine Grammy awards, encompassing his work with Cash, the Chicks, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Adele and the Strokes, as well as in recognition of his production generally. Last year, he interviewed Paul McCartney for the six-part Hulu mini series McCartney 3, 2, 1. Def Jam recently launched a British imprint, 0207 Def Jam. “I’ve always been hopeful that the UK would breed a British invasion in America for hip-hop, in the way it did with the Beatles and Merseybeat,” Rubin said. “Maybe this can set the stage for that dream to come true.” The Creative Act will be published in early 2023.",Arts/Music,Rick Rubin: Def Jam founder and producer announces debut book,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/rick-rubin-def-jam-founder-producer-debut-book
2/11/2022,"Following your report about the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of MPs (Tories fighting net zero plans are dragging climate into new culture war, experts say, 8 February), we hope this letter, supported by all-party parliamentary groups, will reassure your readers and the public that parliamentarians who are not fully behind net zero are a small minority. Our groups are supported by hundreds of parliamentarians, from all major parties, representing the full geography of the UK. We recognise that all our 2019 election manifestos committed to net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. We recognise the environment is now a top concern of the British public. And we recognise the spiralling climate crisis and the urgent need to transition to a more sustainable economy.  There are different approaches to reach net zero, but we all support the goal. Delaying action will cost the country more, as the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility have made clear. In the national interest, we will continue to support and promote ambitious environmental leadership in parliament.Anthony Browne MP Environment APPG, Caroline Lucas MP Climate change APPG, Sir Ed Davey MP Sustainable finance APPG, Peter Aldous MP Intelligent energy APPG, Alex Sobel MP Net zero APPG, Geraint Davies MP Clean air APPG, Ben Lake MP Fuel poverty and energy efficiency APPG, Helene Hayman Co-chair, Peers for the Planet  Business Green’s editor, James Murray, is correct that to undermine the claims of the pro-fossil fuel Net Zero Scrutiny Group, it is vital to explain how the enormous upfront costs of the transition to net zero can be met, but not at the expense of the poor (‘It’s all a bit cynical’: the politicians behind the Tory attack on net zero agenda, 8 February). The fact is that a just transition to net zero is easily affordable, and poorer people and the increasingly squeezed middle class won’t have to suffer in the process. Of course, a windfall tax on Shell’s and BP’s present licence to print money is a key first step, but the question is, where will the bulk of the many tens of billions that are required come from? The key to answering this is to realise that the entire cost of tackling the Covid crisis was funded by a £450bn expansion of the quantitative easing programme. This money creation programme now needs to be expanded again to fund a post-Covid recovery that tackles not just the climate emergency, but also the cost-of-living crisis and the inequality of social provision. Also crucial will be the use of government incentivised savings, such as pensions and ISAs, and a fairer taxation system to help achieve these goals.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group  How depressing, but not surprising, to read your articles on the Net Zero Scrutiny Group. I am 80 years old; I have studied many short courses with the Open University and Future Learn on various environmental subjects, especially those examining the causes and effects of manmade climate change. All these courses emphasise that mitigation to reduce the amount of global heating will be financially much cheaper than adapting to it. I have been on many protests against the climate crisis. I try to live as green a life as possible. I and many others feel betrayed by politicians and scientists such as Steve Koonin, who say “there is no climate crisis”. I hope Prof Koonin does not have grandchildren who will look back in 30 years’ time and say: “Grandpa knew what to do, but he didn’t do it.”Rose HarvieDumbarton, West Dunbartonshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/11/2022,"Who, from a safe distance, doesn’t love a grifter? Especially if the grift is on a grand scale and the marks bring it largely upon themselves? Step forward, then, Anna Delvey – born Anna Sorokin, though that never bothered her overmuch. The apparent German heiress parlayed a quick wit, good wardrobe and non-specific Mitteleuropean accent into an entrée into New York high society. She extracted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the elite fooled by her poise, impressed by her connections and unable to imagine that anyone who knew which wine to order could not be everything she claimed to be. Sorokin was charged with various counts of larceny and other crimes, and in April 2019 found guilty of eight of them. But what a wild ride she had, and this new Netflix dramatisation of her story enjoys every last minute of it. Inventing Anna comes from the Shonda Rhimes stable and stays within the Shondaland (her production company) comfort zone – a multilayered tale brilliantly told, at pace and with glee. It may have more heft than it initially appears, but it is played essentially as a modern soap opera – and God, is it fun. This is a show for those mainly looking to marvel – at the effrontery, the style, the steel nerves of the twentysomething weaving webs from inside a house of cards built on thin ice. Those who are looking for an in-depth, analytical take on the Delvey phenomenon, her pathology or motivations – which the handful of previous documentaries about her have lacked – will have to wait a little longer.  “This whole story that you’re about to sit on your fat ass and watch, like a big lump of nothing, is about me. You know me. Everyone knows me. I’m an icon. A legend.” Thus, in the opening seconds of Inventing Anna, do we meet our antiheroine in all her ice-cold, brutal, contemptuous, compelling glory. Who doesn’t immediately want to follow that ravening, barely containable ego and see where it ends up? Julia Garner is mesmerising as Anna. She keeps her human enough that – like her marks, perhaps – we never lose interest or emotional investment in her, even as we watch her embark on another round of clear-eyed criminality as she works rooms, finds the next pawn in her game, moves to the next stage of her con. If, indeed, con is the right word. For her, it seems to be just a way of being – you get the impression that, like a shark who stops swimming, if she did not live a life of purloined luxury she would die. Garner’s Anna is a kaleidoscopic mixture of fury and defensiveness (when challenged or crossed), sweetness, charm, fierce intelligence and, at times, simple and ineffable weirdness – and you can’t take your eyes off her. Just as good, in a naturally less showy part, is Anna Chlumsky as journalist Vivian Kent. (She is based on the writer Jessica Pressler, whose article about Delvey in New York magazine after her arrest brought Anna to the world’s attention, much to the chagrin of the defrauded banks, art collectors, gallery owners, fashionistas and socialites who wanted their embarrassing gullibility swept under the carpet.) We move back and forth between Kent’s interviews with Anna in prison (“Why do you dress like that?” asks Anna with a characteristic blend of contempt and concern. “You look poor”), her investigations, and scenes that show how Anna got from there (a working-class town outside Moscow) to here (Rikers Island prison, via London, Paris and New York). Besotted boyfriends, railroaded hoteliers and businesswomen who use her as a maid and don’t check their statements lead to bigger and better frauds. Until, that is, the little giveaways lead to greater suspicions, betrayed friends amass grievances that need expression, and eventually the queen of grifters is unmasked and imprisoned.

Though Greene appears to have limited historical knowledge, she does seem to be aware of the Seinfeld episode, later referencing the character’s catchphrase – “no soup for you” – in a tweeted effort to appear in on the joke. Many others made a similar connection. Soup Nazi? pic.twitter.com/d4oluSlonR Could the Soup Nazi have secretly been a member of the gazpacho police? We asked Larry Thomas, who played the character, for his take on the moment as soups and Nazis march back into the headlines. Thomas, no fan of Greene or the ex-president she claims won re-election, says he was floored by the comments. “How in the world can a grown person, who grew up in the 20th century, not know what the word Gestapo is?” he asks. “They say ‘You can’t write this shit.’ It’s beyond you can’t write this shit.” When he heard Greene’s remarks, he knew he’d be dragged into the picture. “If she got the word wrong with a nonsensical word, it would be one thing, but I knew as soon as she actually used the name of a soup that I was in trouble,” Thomas says. “And then she turns around and makes an actual Soup Nazi reference [on Twitter], you know, the ‘no soup for you, and you’re gonna end up in the goulash.’ I’m sure somebody wrote that for her. She can’t possibly be that funny.” A Gazpacho Police TV series, or at least a sketch, now seems inevitable. “Saturday Night Live will jump all over that,” Thomas says, imagining a force that – much like his character – monitors “what kind of soup you’re eating and how you’re eating it”. Though the actor, who also appeared in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and Arrested Development, recently retired, he’d love to resurrect the character. “I wish to God they would ask me to be a part of it,” he says. “I’m sure Jerry wouldn’t mind.” The Soup Nazi is based on a real chef, Al Yeganeh, the man behind New York’s Original Soup Man shop, and Thomas is himself a devoted cook and has written a combination memoir-cookbook. “I grew up with a working single mom that never learned to cook, because she was always working full time. And my dad was the cook, but he took off when I was a little kid,” he says. “I just developed this natural sense of knowing how much spice and which spices to use.” He has “about eight really good soup recipes”, he says. “But I did not venture into gazpacho. So I think it’s gonna be my next.”",News/US news,We asked the Soup Nazi for his take on the ‘gazpacho police’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/marjorie-taylor-green-gazpacho-police-soup-nazi
