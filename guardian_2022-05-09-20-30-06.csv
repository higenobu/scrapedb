5/9/2022,"The entire population of Britain is to be given LSD in a government-sponsored attempt to cheer us up after the pandemic and make us forget about inflation. Well, almost. Dreamachine, one of 10 national projects in Unboxed UK – formerly known as the Festival of Brexit – is as close to state-funded hallucinogens as you can get. This is a free trip inside your own head. It’s a 21st-century version – fully credited – of a psychedelic technique patented in the 60s by Brion Gysin, friend and collaborator of Naked Lunch author William Burroughs. The insight Gysin came up with, while smoking kif in Morocco and popping pills in Paris, is that being exposed to a simple flashing white light while you have your eyes closed can induce intense visual hallucinations. Light flickering at between eight and 13 flashes a second synchronises with the brain’s alpha waves to set off this freaky phenomenon. So at Woolwich Public Market and three more sites in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh, in an experience created by a team including Turner winners Assemble and musician Jon Hopkins, you start by filling out a medical form then stow your possessions in a locker and remove your shoes before being led gently in a group into a large circular chamber where you lie back on a comfy recliner with speakers either side of your head. The induction lays on the danger and tension. Can it really live up to this drama? It can. The pulsing soundtrack starts to get louder as you lie back with eyes closed and the space blackens, which you perceive through your eyelids. Then it begins and I see a great cloud of warm purple expand in front of me, a magenta mist blooming in the void. The speed or brightness of the flashing white lights changes (I assume) and I am dazzled by a sky of bright orange – a marmalade sky. But it is not so much a sky as a wall of colour, electric and dazzling. And inside me. I say “I” because everybody will have a different experience. Maybe you will see real places, old faces, heaven and hell. In my case it was all deliriously abstract except for one moment when there seemed to be a face at the end of a tunnel of light, but I couldn’t recognise who it might be. At maximum intensity of sound and light, complex crystalline structures like bright white beehives or molecular lattices formed out of nowhere, an architecture of pure light. It’s a psychedelic experience all right, but done with light flashes instead of chemicals. Maybe this is “an irresponsible use of public money”, as the parliamentary Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has called the Unboxed festival, but it certainly gave me a pleasant Saturday morning. Despite all the health warnings, if you can lie back, relax and open up, this is a sumptuously enjoyable ride. I just loved it – seeing such majestic beauty and knowing it is all an illusion created by your brain. This makes you wonder what reality is, if we can so easily produce an antidote to it in our heads. If all it takes is a light pulse to make us see infinity, we’re walking William Blake poems. During lockdown I watched with my family a streamed interview with the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli in which he was asked what got him started. Somewhat unexpectedly and awkwardly from a parental point of view, he said that taking hallucinogenic drugs as a young man really helped him glimpse the fabric of reality. So the stuff the Dreamachine let me see might not have been fantasy at all but the nature of the real, quantum universe, as Rovelli describes it in his mind-boggling book Helgoland. Rovelli argues we only exist in relation to others, and Dreamachine is a communal, not a solitary, experience. While you see what you alone can see, you recline alongside others. At the end, we’re led into a chillout space with soft seats and beanbags and a drawing table to share the experience. Some people make sketches of what they saw. Intense colours, pulsing patterns … turns out we all see similar stuff after all. As people try to describe what they saw in the chillout zone, I realise we have all experienced something unearthly and sublime. Gysin truly was a visionary for this is the communal utopian psychedelic dream of the 1960s reborn without addiction, without the casualties. It is a healthy and harmless way to enjoy the secret intoxicants in your own brain and connect with other people who have the same adventure. Dreamachine is the one good thing to come out of Brexit and worth every penny. I say it’s not addictive – but when can I do it again?

5/9/2022,"Gaps in understanding about how cardiovascular disease affects women are putting lives at risk, say experts, who have called for greater action and investment to improve access, quality and equity in women’s heart health. In a presidential advisory issued by the American Heart Association, leading heart doctors argued that women continued to be underrepresented in research for cardiovascular disease – the number one killer of women in the US and UK – and that greater emphasis needed to be placed on prevention and education. They suggested heart health programmes should begin as early as primary school, to engage girls and empower families to take greater control over their health. “We are losing ground on key indicators of cardiovascular health among women, including blood pressure control, weight management and diabetes,” said Dr Véronique Roger, the advisory committee’s corresponding author and a senior investigator at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. According to research funded by the British Heart Foundation, more than 8,000 women died between 2002 and 2013 in England and Wales because they did not receive the same standard of care as men. Inequalities at every stage lead to women being diagnosed late and not getting the prompt treatment and aftercare they need to survive a heart attack. Roger added that there needed to be a cultural shift in how cardiovascular data was presented in research studies, if health equity for women was to be achieved. “Comparing data from women with data from men inherently positions data from men as the gold standard,” said Roger. “For example, the belief that women having a heart attack will present more often with atypical symptoms carries an undertone that women present in the ‘wrong way’.” Instead, researchers should focus on recruiting more women to clinical trials, and analyse their data in a more objective way, she said. The advisory, which was published in the journal Circulation, outlined a roadmap divided into four key areas requiring attention and investment: epidemiology and prevention; awareness; access and delivery of equitable health care; and involvement of health care professionals, researchers and communities. In particular, women and their doctors should be educated about certain female-specific factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as starting menstruating before the age of 11; early menopause (before age 40); hormone imbalances that result in irregular ovulation, eg polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or having unpredictable cycles. Other risk factors include suffering from inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, or depression and anxiety – all of which women are disproportionately affected by – and risks related to oral contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapy, or treatment for various cancers that are more prevalent in women, such as breast, uterine or ovarian cancer, some of which may harm the heart. Of particular concern is heart health among women considering pregnancy, where high blood pressure or diabetes could increase the risk of pre-term delivery, or delivering a baby that is significantly above or below the average birthweight, with potential long-term consequences for that child’s health. “We recommend cardiologists, primary care physicians and obstetricians and gynaecologists work together to quantify and reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease throughout a woman’s life. These interdisciplinary partnerships are crucial to developing and implementing the best approaches that will yield improvements in women’s overall health,” said Nanette Wenger, an emeritus professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, who chaired the advisory group. “We need to help women develop a ‘lifetime approach’ to their health, where they are empowered to proactively manage their heart disease risk in every life stage.”",News/Society,"Lack of research on heart disease in women is risking lives, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/lack-of-research-on-heart-disease-in-women-is-risking-lives-say-experts
5/9/2022,"Partygate should be declared over, done with, expiated, spent. All known “criminals” who consumed a can of beer or glass of prosecco at the wrong time or place should be amnestied. Yes, it was outrageous. It was hypocritical and sickening to millions. Sinners sinned on all sides. But as the pandemic passes into history, let history be its judge. There are critical issues now on the political agenda. Will Westminster never grow up? To outsiders it is incredible that the fate of both Britain’s prime minister and its opposition leader should seriously be hanging in the balance, at the pleasure of scandalously dilatory local police forces. The relevant offences were not trivial, but they do border on it. Everyone knows enough of what happened with Boris Johnson’s parties and Keir Starmer’s curries. The former were clearly a more blatant breaking of the rules than the latter. But for the parties to be subject to six months of police inquiry and a top secret Whitehall investigation is absurd. As for Durham’s police, what might merit half an hour of questions and a slap on the wrist has become a colonial outpost of the Mail on Sunday. Johnson has paid the penalty for his Downing Street staff being out of control. He has been punished by the electorate for lying about it. Starmer should have been canny enough not to demand his resignation as his did. He was foolish and is also being punished. These days the partisan press converts public opinion into a howling mob that makes a court of law seem like a warm bath. Britain’s political theatre has virtues. Its binary nature highlights accountability. Policies are scrutinised and mistakes shouted to the winds. Over the years it is possible that, as a result, British policies may have been sounder and less corrupt than those of other democracies with less rigorous parliaments. That may be possible, but no longer self-evident. Parliamentary ritual is archaic and, time and again, ineffective in scrutinising the executive. The failings of Brexit implementation, the present chaos in Northern Ireland, Priti Patel’s Rwanda gimmick and the soaring cost of living all merit parliament’s undivided attention. Instead we are asked to fume over what time exactly was a Durham curry ordered, and whether the prime minister’s wife went downstairs to the party or the party went upstairs to her. In other words, point-scoring has taken over from what should be the content of political debate. All sense of proportion has evaporated. If the Commons really are shortly to vacate the Palace of Westminster for renovation, a citizens’ uprising should never allow them back without a total reform of their work, purpose and procedures. As for now, Johnson and Starmer should issue a joint statement admitting that under lockdown there were failings on all sides. It was a difficult time for everyone, bad examples were set and sincere apologies due for any offence caused. If anyone wants penalty charges dropped or returned, they can apply. As Lewis Carroll’s Dodo may have said, everybody has lost and all must have amnesties. Now, please, let’s get on.

5/9/2022,"Despite the decades that have passed since they were conjured into existence, not everything has changed in Macondo or in Umuofia. The denizens of Gabriel García Márquez’s fictional Caribbean town remain condemned to solitude and questionable realities, while the people of Chinua Achebe’s allegorical Nigerian village are still dealing with the fallout from the things that fell apart. Both places feature in a new Spanish anthology called Regiones imaginarias (Imaginary Regions), which uses texts, maps and photographs to explore 10 of the most famous locations in fiction and the real places that inspired them. As well as Macondo from One Hundred Years of Solitude and Umuofia from Things Fall Apart, the book sets out in search of regions including William Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha county, Juan Rulfo’s Comala, Abdul-Rahman Mounif’s Hudayb, Andrea Camilleri’s Vigata, and RK Narayan’s Malgudi. The project emerged from conversations between the book’s creators, the journalists Bernardo Gutiérrez and Luis Fernández Zaurín. “Luis and I are fascinated with how, in the works of some authors, reality and concrete places on planet Earth are explained, shaped, and sometimes even changed, by means of imaginary regions,” says Gutiérrez. “These places are not that far removed from reality; in a way, they serve to interpret that reality.” The pair came up with an original list of 40 or so fictional places, including purely imaginary areas such as Middle-earth and Lilliput, before alighting on 10 places rooted in reality. The book – published by Menguantes, which specialises in unusual travel writing – dispatches 10 writers and photographers on 10 quests and also uses a cartographer to map the fictional areas. Its basic aim, according to Gutiérrez, is to explore the extent to which fiction helps us to interpret reality and to address issues from conflict and racism to history and memory. Gutiérrez made two trips to seek out Macondo and to document it in his epistolary contribution to the anthology. He was also lucky enough to meet García Márquez and to confirm his suspicions that Macondo was not solely based on Aracataca, the town in the Colombian Caribbean where the late Nobel laureate was born in 1927. Although Aracataca went as far as holding a referendum on changing its name to Aracataca-Macondo 16 years ago, Gutiérrez also points out that if you look at the nearby municipality of Ciénaga on Google Maps, it says ‘Capital of magical realism’. “I spoke to Gabo for about 15 minutes at a dinner in Havana a couple of years before he died. We talked about politics but also about Macondo. He asked me if I’d found Macondo in Aracataca and I said: ‘Yes. But also in Ciénaga.’ And he said: ‘Yes. It’s in Ciénaga too. But also in Santa Marta.’” On his travels, Gutiérrez saw for himself how thoroughly the imaginary has come to infiltrate the real. While many of the people Gutiérrez met had never read One Hundred Years of Solitude, its episodes were as familiar to them as their own family lore – proof, it seems, of the enduring strength of the Caribbean oral tradition. “With Macondo, it’s not just about an interpretation or a modification of reality: Gabo’s own fiction has ended up interfering with reality and changing it in very interesting ways,” says the journalist. Take, for example, the infamous Ciénaga banana massacre of 1928, which appears in fictionalised form in One Hundred Years of Solitude. “In the book, 3,000 people are killed, but I investigated it and got hold of a contemporary report and no more than 100 people were killed,” he says. “A kind of myth was constructed with Macondo that kind of ended up spreading through the whole region.” Not all the pieces in Imaginary Regions are reportage or semi-fictitious. For her journey back to Umuofia, the Nigerian writer Chika Unigwe chose to write a short story focusing on the great-granddaughter of Okonkwo, the doomed protagonist of Things Fall Apart. Achebe’s book, which she read when she was relatively young, opened Unigwe’s eyes to a version of the past that differed radically from the one she had been taught. “[It] showed me that my people had a history, a civilisation, a way of life that was scuppered by colonisation,” she says. “For the first time, colonisation was presented to me, not as this benign, benevolent project, but as a violent invasion that forced the suicide of one of Umuofia’s most prominent men. That is wild.” While Unigwe’s protagonist, Obiageliaku, lives in a different Umuofia to her great-grandfather, she bears the burden of the family’s shame, and the society she inhabits remains painfully patriarchal and still struggles with its colonial legacy. “I wanted it to go in dialogue with Achebe’s novel, expanding that conversation and inserting a woman at its centre in a way that would have triggered Umuofia,” says the writer. “I hope that it teaches us that the imaginary – not just imaginary spaces – can be platforms for having honest, relevant conversations.” Gutiérrez agrees that fiction can be a more supple and subtle material than historical or geographical fact when tackling the big questions. “While the book is a kind of bridge or dialogue with fiction, the idea wasn’t just to talk about these imaginary regions from an academic or theoretical point of view, but also to actually go in search of them through travel and expeditions,” he says. “And that’s what gives the book its real heft.”",Arts/Books,Imaginary regions: travel book ‘journeys’ to fictional literary locations,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/09/how-fiction-shaped-the-places-that-inspired-literarys-most-famous-locations
5/9/2022,"In a series of vaults adjacent to the Tower of London that used to house fast-food restaurants and shops selling trinkets to tourists, a portal into Jacobean London is being constructed. The Gunpowder Plot is an ambitious immersive experience, created by Layered Reality – the company behind the immersive The War of the Worlds – in collaboration with Historic Royal Palaces. It invites audiences to step back in time and engage with the events of 1605, when Guy Fawkes and a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to blow up parliament and King James I. Danny Robins, the writer behind The Battersea Poltergeist podcast who was recently nominated for an Olivier award for his play 2:22 – A Ghost Story, describes it as “a seismic moment in British history – the revolution that never happened”. While the show employs different storytelling techniques, including video (Tom Felton, Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, will play the digital role of Guy Fawkes), virtual reality and live performance, Robins says that at its heart is an exploration of the men behind the gunpowder plot and what motivated them to take such drastic action. It is, he explains, about “a group of young activists who are being persecuted, who are seeing people that they love imprisoned, tortured, executed, and who want to change their world and want to fight against a government that feels unjust”. In this sense, he says, it feels very contemporary. Now, as then, he explains, “we’re very divided along ideological lines”. The show addresses the implications of that, asking: “How far do you go to change your world?” In the show, groups of 16 people at a time are guided from room to room as actors propel them from scene to scene (people’s different mobility and access needs are addressed). While it contains plenty of action and adventure – there’s a scene inspired by the daring escape of the Jesuit priest John Gerard from the tower – and moments when you are obliged to hide from pursuers, the show ultimately hangs on an ethical dilemma about political violence and whether it is ever justifiable. Audience members are asked to decide who they will side with, the plotters or the crown, and their decision has an impact on their experience of the show. Director Hannah Price was attracted by the challenge of telling this story in an engaging way that did not shy away from historical complexity. One of the things the show does is demonstrate just how devastating an impact such a blast would have had, the lives that would have been lost had they been successful. Guy Fawkes has become a symbol of rebellion, says Price. He is the face of hacker collective Anonymous. She hopes the show enables people to explore the choices he made and the reasons behind them in a way that feels current, “rather than abstracted through the lens of history”. With a background in immersive storytelling and gaming as well as theatre, she hopes to make the audience feel as if they are the protagonists. “What they see, what they feel and how they interact with people have an impact on what happens.” The space plays a part of this. The vaults are part of the Tower of London estates, so not only are they incredibly atmospheric, but, “we really are separated from the people involved in this story just by time, not by location”. When I visit the space in March, it is still in the process of being transformed. Prison cells, boat sheds and panelled Jacobean rooms are taking shape in various underground chambers, along with a bar and restaurant. Banks of 3D printers are creating brackets for lanterns. Historical accuracy has been prioritised as much as possible (a display at the end makes it clear where artistic licence has been applied). Alden Gregory, curator of buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, has taken on the role of historical adviser. What excites him particularly is the opportunity it will afford visitors to see the tower as it would have been in 1605, before later additions were made, and to virtually “reconstruct some of the lost buildings”. Heritage spaces in the UK are increasingly engaging with new ways of making history come alive for their visitors. Historic Royal Palaces has collaborated with theatre companies before, such as Wildworks and Les Enfants Terribles, but this is its most ambitious project. The heritage sector was hit hard by the pandemic, affected in a similar way as live performance. With historic buildings closed to the public, many jobs were lost. It is necessary, says Robins, to find new ways of making people, particularly younger ones, want to visit these spaces; to make them feel relevant. “I wonder if we feel less connected to history than we did in the past?” he asks. In 1605, plague remained a real threat – it delayed the opening of parliament. Londoners’ lives then, as now, were disrupted by disease. Robins hopes the show will give visitors a welcome boost after the routine imposed by lockdown. “I love the idea of making theatre feel adrenalised.” Virtual reality, he says, has “this ability to make us feel like kids again. It’s a real magic lantern for our age.” Yet virtual reality is only one aspect of what is a live, interactive experience, he stresses, one that starts when you leave daylight behind and descend beneath the streets. London is a city of layers, steeped in history. Robins loves the idea of theatre that penetrates these layers and, in doing so, to step back in time. Immersive theatre, he says, is the “closest thing that we have right now to time travel”.

As she spoke her manager Emma Hayes, with the biggest of smiles, nodded. Because this is the crux of Chelsea’s success. Hayes has recruited supreme talents, Kerr being one of them, but she also focuses on team players, players with the right attitude, players, like Kerr, who see themselves winning even when things are not going their way.

The Gunners will be heartbroken but their performance remained an illuminating one, mainly thanks to Stina Blackstenius. The Sweden international was brought on in the 61st minute and scored with her first touch. In the duration of this season she has dug her side out of a few holes, which the manager, Jonas Eidevall, acknowledged. “One of Stina’s strengths is the finish on the penetration pass, she doesn’t need many chances to score from those situations,” he said. “It’s something Stina does very well and we needed her to do it today.” With Vivianne Miedema rumoured to be leaving Arsenal this summer, it may be a point of progression for Blackstenius to make that role her own. Whatever the case, she will be a key cog in an Arsenal attack that could shape up entirely differently next season.

Calls for Taylor’s sacking got loud from fans and neutrals after their worst start to a WSL season, including a shock loss to West Ham, but he steered the team back on course. The manager’s tactical play, and the return of big names such as Lucy Bronze and Chloe Kelly from injury, meant City closed out their campaign to seal third place and Champions League football again next season. The end of the campaign saw the club win nine consecutive league games and score 29 goals in the process. That meant a complete transformation of what most predicted would be their final position, and they also broke the hearts of local rivals Manchester United, who finished fourth. SR Tottenham finished off their campaign with a 1-0 win over Leicester to secure their highest-ever WSL finish in their three seasons in the league. Spurs ended up fifth, improving on their eighth and seventh in the past two campaigns. Their success has largely been down to the manager, Rehanne Skinner, who has done a fantastic job in her first full season at Spurs. Skinner not only had Tottenham in the fight for the Champions League for the majority of the season but they also inflicted a surprise defeat on Manchester City. Fans will be expecting more of the same, or to even improve, as Skinner has signed a new contract, running until 2024. The only way is up for Tottenham with Skinner having the time to build something special. SR The struggles of Brighton and Everton over the course of the season have been clear to see. Consistency has been hard to come by and you can imagine both are rather welcoming the summer break to reset. As is common in games with little to play for, their match on Sunday went much as expected, ending in a 1-1 draw. However, there was still time for football to show its romantic side. Pre-match, Brighton’s Aileen Whelan announced that she was ending her five-year association with the club. With her side trailing, she entered the pitch to fire home a second-half equaliser. A firm fans’ favourite, it was the perfect way to say goodbye and close this chapter of her career. SD “I’m immensely proud of them”, said a satisfied Darren Carter as his already relegated Birmingham side showed their mettle to edge past Aston Villa 1-0. “To come off the back of this week and everything that happened on Wednesday with the relegation to then pick themselves up and go again was an incredible effort.” He had every right to be pleased after the most challenging of weeks that saw Birmingham’s WSL tenure come to an end. A final-day trip across the city to their biggest rivals gave his side a strong incentive to end their campaign on a high. A spirited performance saw them thwart Villa’s threat while Veatriki Sarri popped up in the 10th minute to truly spoil the party for their hosts and the 8,000 watching fans.

5/9/2022,"Importents The week before the election of the dictator, people hotly debatedwhether Friday the thirteenth was a lucky or unlucky date. The day before the election of the dictator,over three hundred starlings were discovered dead in a country lane. The day of the election of the dictator,rain clobbered the streets but hope still chattered in the air. The first day of the dictatorship,a storm on the other side of the world dumped tens of thousands of fat innkeeper wormson a beach: a pale pink tsunami of a species also known as penis fishfor its striking resemblance to the semi-tumescent memberof a uni-testicular Caucasian adult male. An hour before their corpses were found, the starlingshad been seen in murmuration. The post-mortem revealed they died of trauma and internal bleeding,consistent with flying hard into the road. Naomi Foyle’s 10th chapbook, Importents, responds to a range of political catastrophes, local and global. The title poem finds its bearings in the UK around the time the Conservatives, led by Boris Johnson, won the 2019 general election. Whether it was triskaidekaphobia or the association of Friday 13th with goddess-worship that influenced the choice of the election date doesn’t seem to be recorded, but the claim in the opening couplet usefully locates the poem’s immediate context, and target. At the same time, it sets up readers’ expectations of a narrative with magical realist overtones. Portents accumulate as the first four couplets move through an election-orientated calendar, repeating the doubly chilling phrase, “the election of the dictator”. The world of the poem, and the world it says is ours, is subject to the irrational and unlikely. Nature is shown to foreshadow unnatural times in which even democratic elections can produce monsters. The poem’s two main “natural” occurrences, while compelling in their role as portents, are based on real events. On December 11 2019, hundreds of starlings were found dead on a lane on the island of Anglesey. As the poem says, the cause of death when investigated turned out to have been trauma. The birds had made their disastrous headlong descent in an attempt to avoid either bad weather or a raptor, the toxicologists concluded. Such explanations are only minimally more convincing than the impending election of a dictator. Another real-life incident, though not a one-off, the “pale pink tsunami” of fat innkeeper worms is explained and illustrated in a report from California. As a portent of male dictatorship and democratic impotence these unfortunate creatures, unsurprisingly nicknamed penis fish, are a gift. They do indeed resemble “the semi-tumescent member/of a uni-testicular Caucasian adult male.” English readers of a certain age may remember the scurrilous second world war ditty concerning the genitalia of Hitler and his associates. The now terminally flaccid penis fish seem to ridicule the kind of “strong man” political leadership currently popular around the world. Human societies might have been expected to have outgrown the primitive but immensely dangerous cult by now. An individual’s pursuit of power to the point of tyranny may or may not mask his sexual inadequacy; what matters is that its achievement is a massively disabling injury to the body politic. Foyle relishes the image over four verses, and then demonstrates the effects of tyranny by bringing back the starlings, and heightening the metaphorical dimension already suggested – see “Hope still chattered in the air” in line six. She tells us that an hour before they plunged to their death, the starlings “had been seen in murmuration”. Though the term murmuration is an ornithological one, it imports a decision-making consciousness to the birds. It’s as if a human community had called a meeting and had decided to end their lives in a collective protest. As the “hard road” and “internal bleeding” kills the starlings, so the hard road of life under dictatorship destroys the fine structures of the society on which it’s imposed. The castigation of the tyrant has a long poetic history. In the 20th century, its nature and effects are summarised and given the force of legend by W H Auden in Epitaph on a Tyrant. Entering that tradition, Importents is lifted, by its folk-narrative style, beyond the frame of fixed “small island” contexts. It is set in the winter of 2019 but uncannily resonant with the current grim year and its “zeitgeist”.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: Importents by Naomi Foyle,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/09/poem-of-the-week-importents-by-naomi-foyle
5/9/2022,"Why bats?” I ask Morgan Hughes, a 47-year-old ecologist from Walsall. “They’re one of the only animals recorded to exhibit true altruism,” she replies. “Vampire bats will share their meals with other vampire bats, even if they’re not related. They’ll regurgitate the food.” They provide excellent pest control, too: some bats can eat 3,000 midges in a night. And they are crucial to many ecosystems. Fruit bats, for example, disperse seeds across the rainforest. Their droppings are a highly nutritious fertiliser. But what Hughes really loves about bats, she says, is how little we know about them: “There are 1,400-plus species of bat, which means there’s so much to learn.” Hughes became an enthusiast after attending a bat conference in 2004. “I met people who were so passionate, and it was infectious,” she says. “Bats are underdogs. People are a bit scared of them. They’re mysterious. And from an academic perspective, they’re challenging to survey, and I like specialising in something that not man people specialise in. And besides, bats really need the help.” Hughes is referring to anti-bat feelings among the public: “I don’t want people to shudder when we talk about them. I want to combat that fear through education.” The prejudice kicked up a notch during the pandemic: some scientists believe the Covid-19 virus originated in bats, before spreading to humans via an intermediary species. “It has been a bad few years for bats,” Hughes sighs. While some of the stereotypes are true – they do carry a lot of diseases – this is, she says simply because there are so many types of bat. The only mammals with more species diversity are rodents (which are also commonly associated with disease). To combat these negative attitudes, Hughes leads community outreach efforts, taking people on walks with bat detectors, so they can hear the animals echolocating for insects in the air, making high-pitched “chip-chip” sounds. During lockdown, Hughes would spend her daily hour of exercise on a bat walk and live-stream it to Facebook. “That was really successful,” she says. “We had loads of people joining.” On a summer evening you’re never far from a bat. Hughes lives in the centre of town but, she says, “any night in summer I can hang a detector out of my window and pick up bats.” In her 20 years of running bat walks, she’s never had anyone freak out. In fact, Hughes insists that bats are “cute and fluffy”. “Bats aren’t everyone’s cup of tea,” says Florence Wilkinson, author of Wild City: Encounters With Urban Wildlife. “But Morgan – who already spends her days working in ecology – dedicates five nights a week between April and October to furthering our knowledge of these creatures, and educating the public that they are far from hellish.” In addition to her public engagement, Hughes monitors local bat populations with the help of a team of about 35 volunteers. Hughes’s team trap bats in bat boxes, assess their condition, weigh and measure them, and note their species type. They wear PPE while doing this, so as not to spread diseases – including Covid – to bats, who may not have natural immunity. The bat boxes don’t smell as bad as you’d expect. “Bat droppings are dry and crumbly, and sparkle under a microscope because of all the beetle-wing cases,” Hughes says. By monitoring the bats, Hughes can see which animals return each year, which bats they are roosting with, and how healthy they are. Her team tracks their population in a cavern in Dudley Zoo and a disused limestone mine in Walsall. All these efforts are unpaid. The day we speak, she’s packing her things for an 11am Saturday walk around her bat boxes, not that she minds. “I live and sleep bats. Some would say I need to get a life. It’s a round-the-clock thing for me,” Hughes says. “It’s been 20 years and I’m more fascinated than ever.” I ask her, of course, for her views on the Batman franchise. “I like the Batman films,” she responds. “They’re fine. I’m a Christian Bale girl.” When asked what she would like for her treat, Hughes immediately thinks of her team of volunteers. When they’re surveying bats, they can be out for five or six hours on cool spring evenings. During the swarming season at the end of the summer, they might be out all night. Robert Dyas offers to provide her entire team with sturdy Thermoses, and Hughes is overjoyed when they turn up. “They’re giant, proper flasks,” she says. “Everyone is going to be so happy. Having a hot drink makes a massive difference.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

5/9/2022,"Say what you like about Donald Trump’s supporters, you cannot fault them for commitment. When the former president arrived for his latest rally in a deeply rural corner of western Pennsylvania, many had already been standing in solid rain for 10 hours. The field in which they were to greet their revered leader was a mud bath. By the time Trump finally arrived, 20 minutes late, the scene had taken on the qualities of the apocalypse – like the closing sequences of the Fyre Festival. On this occasion, the seemingly boundless patience of Trump’s devoted followers was being put to the test for an additional reason. He had come to the Westmoreland Fairgrounds outside Greensburg to sprinkle Trump stardust on his preferred choice for the US Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican senator Pat Toomey. Whether Pennsylvanian conservatives go along with the endorsement when the primary is held on 17 May will have big consequences, not merely on Trump’s record of advancing his chosen people – and with it his grip on the Republican party. It will also have ramifications for the November election which, in tune with recent contests in the state, is almost certain to be nail-bitingly close and could be critical in determining whether the Republicans retake the Senate. The trouble is, many Trump supporters don’t know what to make of Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV surgeon better known as Dr Oz. “We love Trump, but we’ll be booing Oz,” said Pam, 46, a local educator who asked to give only her first name. She admitted one of the reasons she had turned up in the first place was to see how hostile her fellow Trump supporters would be towards the candidate. In the end, after all that sodden waiting, Pam was disappointed. Occasional booing could be heard earlier in the evening whenever Oz was mentioned, but when the man himself took to the stage, whether by design or accident, the music was cranked up so loud that it was impossible to tell jeering from cheering. By now the pattern is well established. Prominent individuals are so desperate for Trump’s blessing that they suspend cognitive functioning and act as his slavish mouthpiece. The phenomenon was vividly illustrated after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol last year. Republican leaders including Kevin McCarthy were at first critical of Trump’s role but then began faithfully repeating his big lie that the election had been stolen from him. More recently, JD Vance, the venture capitalist author of Hillbilly Elegy, ditched his earlier criticisms of Trump in order to win the former president’s endorsement in the race for a US Senate seat in Ohio. The humiliating gambit paid off last week, with Vance sealing the Republican primary having received a bounce from Trump’s backing. Of all the many examples of this form, there has rarely been as dramatic a shedding of fact-based reasoning in exchange for Trump’s universe of alternative facts than that displayed by Oz. He has descended from the scientific heights of a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, down through his promotion of quack remedies on his daytime TV show, and into a full-Maga embrace of the Trump big lie. Oz, 61, has an impeccable medical background. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, he is the son of Turkish immigrants and followed his father into cardiothoracic surgery, with Ivy League training at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. At his peak, he was an innovator in minimally invasive heart surgery. At Columbia University, where he treated patients until 2018, he authored numerous peer-reviewed papers bearing impenetrable sentences like this one: “In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, CPB time, previous cardiac surgery, sternal wound infection, postoperative renal failure, and postoperative stroke were all associated with increased risk of mortality following MICS.” His weakness – or strength? – was the allure of fame and fortune. In 1996 he performed a heart transplant on the brother of the New York Yankees manager in the middle of a World Series which the Yankees won. Such extraordinary serendipity turned him into a media darling. Oprah Winfrey came calling, dubbing him “America’s doctor”, and the end result was The Dr Oz Show which ran until this January. His show included public-service broadcasting, bringing attention to Type 2 diabetes and encouraging his viewers to eat more healthily. But over time he slid into controversial territory. By 2014 he was being called a “snake oil peddler” and hauled before a US Senate committee for touting “miracle” diet products on The Dr Oz Show. “I don’t get why you need to say this stuff because you know it’s not true,” Claire McCaskill, then senator from Missouri, berated him. During the pandemic, he championed several of the same discredited pseudoscience treatments such as hydroxychloroquine pushed by Trump. To complete the decline, the cardiothoracic surgeon has now incorporated into his Pennsylvania Senate campaign the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost was riddled with fraud. “I have discussed it with President Trump and we cannot move on,” he said at a recent televised debate for the Republican primary. “We have to be serious about what happened in 2020.” There is no evidence that fraud on a significant scale occurred in the 2020 election, in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. The problem with being a daytime TV host is that you leave a very long paper trail. Oz’s rivals for the Republican nomination have been bombarding Pennsylvania voters with attack ads portraying him as a “Hollywood liberal” and a Rino – Republican In Name Only. Among the inconvenient truths that the adverts regurgitate is the time that Oz invited Michelle Obama onto his show, his reflections on systemic racism and how it leads to disparities in health outcomes, and his discussions on how to reduce deaths and injuries from guns. The attack ads have featured a 2019 interview in which he questioned Republican states that were introducing bills to ban abortion at six weeks known as heartbeat bills. “But the heart’s not beating”, Oz is shown accurately saying. And then there was the segment on his show that he called “Transgender kids: too young to decide?” where he invited children experiencing gender dysphoria and their parents to talk about their journey. The downpour of negative political adverts carrying politically awkward clips from the Oz show has clearly had an impact on the race. Latest polls show the Republican primary race as too close to call, with the TV personality in a slim lead on 18% to the 16% of his main rival, the super-wealthy former hedge fund CEO, David McCormick. By contrast, the Democratic field of candidates appears to be already settled with a clear frontrunner: Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, John Fetterman. He is a champion of labour unions, legalised marijuana and combating inequalities in income, health and housing. Certainly, doubts about Oz remained prevalent among the Trump devotees braving the Westmoreland rain on Friday night. “I’m leary,” said Ken Rockhill, 52. “I want to trust Trump’s candidate, but I’m leary. He’s going to have to prove himself.” Rockhill, an artist from Pittsburgh, said his doubts about Oz stemmed from the candidate’s time as a TV personality. Which was odd, given that Trump himself carries the same lineage. “Oz was caught up with that whole Hollywood thing with his show,” Rockhill said. “He was big with the Obamas, hobnobbing with all the stars – that never ends well.” Sharon Nagle, 60, a bartender from a small coal-mining town, said she was troubled by Oz’s dual US-Turkish citizenship. That issue has also been seized upon by Oz’s Republican rivals who have called his Turkish ties a national security risk, forcing him to promise to renounce his Turkish citizenship should he win the Senate seat. Nagle also objects to Oz’s Muslim identity. “I love Trump, but he’s got this wrong. I will never vote for a Muslim – they plan to take over America from within and pass sharia-style laws. That’s what I think, and I’m not a bigot.” Pam, the Trump supporter who had come to see whether Oz would be booed off stage, said that as a Christian her antipathy to him stemmed from a 2010 episode of The Dr Oz Show that featured an eight-year-old girl who had transitioned from her male gender at birth. “To use your platform to say a boy aged eight can change gender – that’s evil,” she said. Did she think Trump had made a mistake in endorsing him? Yes, Pam said, showing a surprising willingness to question the former president’s judgment despite being a fervent Maga supporter. “The man is not God,” Pam said, referring to Trump. “He puts his pants on, one leg at a time.” Out of curiosity, the Guardian asked Pam whether she ever watched The Dr Oz Show. Her eyes lit up and she beamed. “Oh yes,” she said. “We love the Dr Oz show!” Political strategists at the rally worked extra hard to try and overcome the chilly response to the Oz endorsement. Vance was rolled out on stage, with the clear hope that the victory he pulled out of the hat last week might somehow rub off on Oz. The crowd was assailed through the evening with 30-second videos attempting to debunk the portrayal of the candidate given in the attack ads. Here was Oz surrounded by children insisting life begins at conception. Here was Oz dressed in lumberjack shirt brandishing a double-barreled shotgun – how could this man be against the second amendment? When Oz finally addressed the crowd he reassured them that he was one of them – a genuine Maga man. “The president endorsed me as an America First candidate … President Trump endorsed me because I am smart, I am tough and I will never let you down.” Then Trump himself bigged up his chosen candidate. “We endorse a lot of people a little out of the box,” he said, paying the subtlest lip service to his followers’ misgivings. He reminded the crowd how Oz had invited him onto his show in 2016, giving the then presidential hopeful a great bill of health though telling him to lose a few pounds. “Dr Oz has had an enormously successful career on TV and now he’s running to save our country from the radical lunatics,” Trump said. Being Trump, his most passionate argument for voting for Oz was also the most quizzical. “His show is great. He’s on that screen, he’s in the bedrooms of all those women telling them good and bad.” It’s not quite clear what Trump meant by that. Will it be the Trump magic needed to put Oz over the finish line?

5/9/2022,"Fernandinho has backed youngsters CJ Egan-Riley and Lucas Mbete to perform if required in the absence of the injured Kyle Walker, John Stones and Ruben Dias as Manchester City seek to retain the Premier League title. Dias was forced out of Sunday’s 5-0 win over Newcastle United at the Etihad Stadium due to a hamstring injury and Pep Guardiola later stated he, Stones and Walker will not play for City in the remaining three matches of the season. While Fernandinho replaced Dias, the 19-year-old Egan-Riley made his league debut as an 87th-minute substitute for Aymeric Laporte. Mbete, who is 18, was an unused member of the matchday squad and has yet to play in the Premier League. Nathan Ake’s ankle problem makes the defender a serious doubt for Wednesday’s trip to Wolves meaning one of Egan-Riley or Mbete may be under consideration to start, although Guardiola’s options include moving Rodri from midfield into his rearguard “We have some injury issues now and at the end of the season that is normal,” said Fernandinho. “It is a pleasure for me to see some of the young lads coming in and playing because they have an opportunity to play with us [now] and we know what they are capable of. They show every day in every [training] session that they can play for Manchester City first team – he [Egan-Riley] got his opportunity to play a few minutes and I’m delighted for him.” City are three points ahead of Liverpool, who also have three games left, with a superior goal difference of four, and Fernandinho was pleased with their display against Newcastle in light of their heartbreaking Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid a few days earlier. “Yes, it was a great response but at the same time we are focusing on ourselves and know the title is in our hands,” said the Brazilian. “It doesn’t matter what they [Liverpooll] do over there, we have to keep going. This is what we are trying to do, focus on ourselves but I thought it was a great response after defeat in Madrid, especially for our fans and ourselves because when you lose a match like this the confidence can go a little bit down. But not just the result, the performance overall was really good and we are really happy about that.” If City do retain the championship it will be Fernandinho’s fifth for a club he plans on leaving in the summer. “Every title is sweet,” he said. “It’s going to be one more – with a little more sugar.”",Sport/Football,Fernandinho backs young defenders to show their worth for Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/fernandinho-backs-young-defenders-to-show-their-worth-for-manchester-city
5/9/2022,"Jamie Lee Curtis has berated Marvel’s new film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, comparing it unfavourably with her new movie Everything Everywhere All at Once while conceding she has blown her chances of getting a role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In a string of posts on social media, Curtis, star of Halloween, claimed Everything Everywhere All at Once “out marvels any Marvel movie they put out there” and even suggested Doctor Strange had used a “copycat” poster. She added: “Is this one of those internet feuds? All I’ll say is we would SLAY in a family feud contest … with the Doctor Strange strangers.” Curtis’ Instagram posts appear to have been sparked by Everything Everywhere All at Once’s exceptional box office performance, including reaching the number one position for a single day’s takings in the US, recording over $700,000 on 4 May, nearly six weeks after its release. In one of her posts, Curtis wrote: “How is it POSSIBLE, that in week six, SIX, that our little MOVIE THAT COULD AND CAN AND IS CRUSHING the box office … This little miracle of a movie is proving that art will out and that creativity and independent cinema is very much ALIVE and KICKING.” Doctor Strange was released on 5 May and recorded an estimated $36m on its opening day. Curtis adds: “COMPETITIVE? Fuck YES. I wasn’t head cheerleader in high school for nothing” and concludes one post with the hashtag: #guessiwillneverbecastinamarvelmovie. Both films contain plot elements relating to a “multiverse”, or parallel universes, but while the Marvel movie is a sequel to the blockbuster 2016 Doctor Strange starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Everything Everywhere All at Once stars Michelle Yeoh as a Chinese-American woman being audited by the US tax service. Curtis has also commented unfavourably on the relative size of Doctor Strange’s budget, writing: “[Everything Everywhere All at Once] COST LESS than the ENTIRE craft service budget on Doctor Strange and/or any other Marvel movie.” Everything Everywhere All at Once’s budget is reported at around $25m, with Doctor Strange’s reported at $200m.",Arts/Film,Jamie Lee Curtis starts ‘feud’ with Marvel’s rival multiverse movie Doctor Strange,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/09/jamie-lee-curtis-starts-feud-with-marvels-rival-multiverse-movie-doctor-strange
5/9/2022,"The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust has told fans who chanted “sign on” at Anfield that using joblessness and poverty to wind-up opposing supporters is not acceptable. “Singing about the opposition has long been a feature of English football, and we are reluctant to tell fans how they should support the team. Nevertheless, we were disappointed to hear the ‘Sign on’ chant at Saturday’s away match at Anfield,” read a THST statement. “Poverty and joblessness are not fair game for banter. There is a cost of living crisis throughout England, including in London. Our club represents an area and community with the fastest growing rate of unemployment in the country.” The chant, sung to the tune of You’ll Never Walk Alone, has been directed at Liverpool and Everton fans since the 1980s, when Merseyside suffered a severe economic recession with Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. It could be heard again during Saturday’s 1-1 draw between Tottenham and Liverpool. “We are rightly proud of our away support, and we want it to be noticed for positive reasons. For most of the game at Anfield our fans gave superb backing to a great team performance. “Spurs fans have provided financial backing to Marine FC on Merseyside, and regularly contribute to foodbanks and community initiatives in London. This is what we are about. The ‘Sign on’ chant is not what we are about. We’re Tottenham Hotspur.

5/9/2022,"AJ Jacobs is from the “my journey” school of nonfiction and takes a magpie approach across about 20 varieties of puzzle, sharing titbits and examples. So the reader who has recently fallen down the rabbit hole of extreme sudoku might want to start with the chapter describing scavenger hunts; the wordplay buff might enjoy contemplating the crucial difference between a labyrinth and a maze. The highlight is titled “Chess Puzzles (Chess Problems)” and the pace appropriately slows. Jacobs offers his chess set to former world champion Garry Kasparov, who describes himself as “the first knowledge worker whose job was threatened by machines”. Author and grandmaster alike are pleasingly given to contemplating why and how people like to answer riddles, clues and codes. When Kasparov solves a problem (or puzzle) that involves sacrificing a queen, and remarks that a machine player does not have the concept of sacrifice, there’s an exchange I found valuably cheering: So should we try to eliminate our irrational psychological barriers when solving problems?‘You cannot do that,’ Garry says, ‘because then we’ll lose our humanity.’ It would, he says, have catastrophic effects in other areas of life. Like, I suspect, many of us, Jacobs places the crossword at the centre of puzzling. We open with his excitement at having been an answer in the New York Times puzzle, and the amusing and poignant difference it makes when you consider whether you’re fodder for a Tuesday or for a Saturday. We’ve talked here before about an odd decision made by Stephen Sondheim. Wishing to convert American solvers to the delights of British-style cryptics, he compiled some himself – but in the form of our newspapers’ weekend puzzles, with no black squares and eye-wateringly demanding endgames; that is, the hardest crosswords there are. Likewise, Jacobs centres his cryptics chapter around a fiendish Spectator puzzle by Pabulum, which means we get a little glimpse of the Spectator editor who sets locally as Maskarade. Beginners are, as always, redirected to start with the Guardian’s quiptic, the Observer’s Everyman or the Times’ quick cryptic. One aspect of The Puzzler is time sensitive: the introduction (available here) contains an encoded message, which unlocks a series of bespoke puzzles for which American readers can receive a cash prize but which British solvers might enjoy for the urgent and varied challenge. Len Deighton’s spy Harry Palmer is prone to solving the odd clue, so many of us have been watching ITV’s The Ipcress File revival, hoping for some Morse-like appearances of crosswords in the plot. So far, we haven’t been given much. Harry solves a clue on a bed in episode two: ‘Monastic order enjoys breakfast.’Eggs Benedict.I’m starving. As we’ve discussed here before, fictional crosswords are prone to including clues which are almost but not quite cryptic. Given the care ITV have put into this series (viewers on catchup will miss the period continuity announcements from the old-fashioned telly), we can hope for more, ideally starting with the next Harry Palmer story. Horse Under Water is the only one that hasn’t been adapted for the screen, and the chapter titles resemble crossword clues. Let’s open the comments and reconvene in four weeks?

5/9/2022,"Europe’s first commercial facility for psychedelic drug trials is to open in London, with the goal of making the UK a global leader in psychedelics research and innovation. The British startup Clerkenwell Health aims to begin trials in its central London facility in August, initially focusing on the use of psilocybin to help people deal with the anxiety associated with a diagnosis of terminal illness, and to support them through their end-of-life care. The news comes as scientists and policymakers gather in London this Wednesday for the Agenda for Psych Symposium, a daylong programme to discuss the latest research and the future of the psychedelics industry in Europe. Tom McDonald, the CEO at Clerkenwell Health, said: “Psychedelic assisted therapy could be groundbreaking for mental health treatment, and the UK is well placed to be at the vanguard of that as a global leader in clinical trials post-Brexit. “Our aim is to establish the UK as the heart of the commercial psychedelic research ecosystem, working closely with mental health experts and drug developers around the world to tackle some of the most complex mental health conditions.” Drug developers are increasingly exploring psychedelic compounds as potential treatments for mental health conditions such as mood disorders, PTSD and addictions, but their status as controlled substances can make it bureaucratically challenging and expensive to progress them through clinical trials. Conducting these studies in countries such as the UK – where similar trials have already been approved and regulators are more familiar with the safety profiles and potential benefits of these drugs – is one solution. However, foreign companies may need shepherding through UK regulatory processes to avoid unnecessary delays. This is where specialist clinical research organisations come in: rather than developing one compound or class of compounds for a single condition, Clerkenwell Health will work with multiple drug developers to tackle a range of complex mental health conditions using various psychedelic agents. It will also offer training for therapists who want to work with psychedelic drugs. Peter Rands, the CEO at Small Pharma, which is trialling the use of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to treat depression, said: “A set of very specific conditions need to be met to do psychedelic-assisted therapy; it’s quite a specialised area of expertise. The eight or so companies in clinical trials with psychedelic-based medicines heavily rely on contract research organisations to do this kind of research – particularly as they begin to enter [late-stage] clinical trials.” Prof David Nutt, director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit at Imperial College London and the former chair of the UK’s advisory committee on the misuse of drugs, said: “There is clearly a need to facilitate clinical trials with psychedelic drugs beyond the very few academic centres currently doing this research. So I welcome an external organisation developing the necessary skills and expertise to support companies wanting to invest in these treatments.” The facility will be based near Harley Street and will initially employ 13 members of staff. The first trials, planned in collaboration with the Toronto-based biotechnology company Psyence, will focus on the use of psilocybin for the treatment of adjustment disorder – an emotional or behavioural reaction to a stressful event in someone’s life – in people with terminal diagnoses. Clerkenwell Health is also working with the Canada- and US-based companies Mindset Pharma and Mydecine, which focus on treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders, and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for depression and nicotine addiction. Jessica Riggleman, senior director of clinical and regulatory affairs at Mydecine, said the UK was an attractive place to conduct psychedelic drug trials because of a recently introduced pathway, called the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway, which aims to reduce the time to market for innovative therapies.",News/Science,Europe’s first psychedelic drug trial firm to open in London,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/09/europes-first-psychedelic-drug-trial-firm-to-open-in-london
5/9/2022,"Tearing up the Human Rights Act would have “dire consequences” including removing obligations to properly address violence against women and girls and destabilising peace in Northern Ireland, more than 50 organisations have warned. In a letter to Boris Johnson, Amnesty, Liberty, the British Institute of Human Rights and others have spelled out the “significant implications” of repealing the act, which is expected to be announced in the Queen’s speech on Tuesday, asking for an urgent meeting to discuss the plans. Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s chief executive, said: “Tearing up the Human Rights Act will unleash a Pandora’s box of dire consequences for the UK and we desperately urge the prime minister to reconsider. “Not only will repealing the Human Rights Act damage the UK’s international reputation, but it will also undermine the global system of rights and protections and our ability to hold other countries to account, just at a time when we have never needed those protections more.” The signatories, who also include Stonewall, Friends of the Earth, End Violence Against Women Coalition and Freedom from Torture, express concern that the prime minister intends to remove obligations to protect certain rights. As an example of how female victims of violence have been able to rely on those obligations, they cite the successful judicial review brought under the act by two early victims of the serial sexual attacker John Worboys against the police for its failure to properly investigate the black-cab driver, who subsequently went on to assault scores more women. The letter says that given that the incorporation of the European convention of human rights (ECHR), achieved through the Human Rights Act, was an explicit commitment of the Good Friday agreement, amending the act risks breaching the peace deal in Northern Ireland. It would also require a review of the delicately balanced peace settlement on which it would be difficult to achieve consensus, it adds. Deshmukh said: “The Human Rights Act is the most significant piece of rights legislation in the UK and it plays an absolutely vital role in ensuring stability, justice and protection at home and abroad. This is no time to replace it with a watered-down substitute.” The letter, shared with the Guardian, says repealing the act would have many “far-reaching and very real consequences”. By claiming that the European court of human rights is going beyond its legitimate role and that parliament requires a “democratic shield” against adverse judgments in Strasbourg, the UK is following in the footsteps of countries with authoritarian leaders such as Russia, Hungary and Poland, it says. The signatories write: “If the UK is serious about defending human rights and international law, it cannot be taking steps at home that undermine the most important international human rights mechanism in its region.” A government spokesperson said: “Our proposals will strengthen quintessentially British human rights, such as freedom of expression, while staying a party to the ECHR. They will also prevent abuses of the system, adding a healthy dose of common sense and restore parliament’s rightful role as the ultimate decision-maker on laws impacting the UK population.”",News/Law,"Consequences ‘dire’ if Human Rights Act ditched, more than 50 groups warn",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/09/consequences-dire-human-rights-act-ditched-northern-ireland-boris-johnson
5/9/2022,"Former Opals captain Jenna O’Hea has spoken about the incident which prompted Liz Cambage’s messy exit from the national program, alleging unconfirmed claims the star told her Nigerian rivals to “go back to your third-world country” are true. Cambage was independently investigated and issued a formal reprimand – but not suspended or fined – after last year’s practice-game altercation derailed the Opals’ Tokyo Olympics campaign. In the days after the Nigeria clash she withdrew from the Games citing mental health concerns and then, despite remaining available for selection for this year’s World Cup in Sydney, said she would never again play for the Opals. However, the specifics of Cambage’s on-court actions have remained a mystery since. On Sunday, while O’Hea was a guest on the ABC’s Offsiders program, she was asked about the incident by the show’s host, Kelli Underwood. “This all started in that training game, or the pre-Olympics game, when you played Nigeria,” Underwood said. “And it’s never really emerged what happened, but I’ve had it confirmed from a few sources, is it correct that you were playing Nigeria and Liz Cambidge had her feathers ruffled and she turned to them and said, ‘go back to your third world country’? “And, of course, Ezi Magbegor is originally Nigerian, a Nigerian who is now living in Australia and playing for your team, and as a result there was a brawl that erupted, and since then you haven’t spoken to her?” O’Hea responded with the claim: “That is all 100% correct.” Fellow guest Caroline Wilson then asked O’Hea whether Cambage would ever represent Australia again. “No,” O’Hea said. Last July, when Cambage unexpectedly withdrew from the Australian team on the eve of the Olympics, she called it “literally one of the hardest decisions of my life”. In a social media post, she also hit out at “lies” and “fake news” surrounding her decision and directly responded to speculation about the on-court incident during that scrimmage against Nigeria. “Yeah, things got heated in the Nigeria game, there was a physical altercation and there were words exchanged,” Cambage said. “But I’m hearing things that aren’t true at all. Everything that happened and everything I’ve said is on film.” Offsiders also aired footage of an ABC interview with Cambage from her base in Los Angeles, where she has started playing with WNBA side the LA Sparks. The 30-year-old, who has a Nigerian father, said: “I’m living my best life. I’m supported. I’m protected on a level that the Opals or the Australian team never gave to me. “My heart lies with those who want to protect me and those who want me to be the best I can be, and I never felt that at the Opals at all.” O’Hea, a longtime captain of Cambage, responded: “I can hold my head up high and say I always loved her, always cared for her, supported her, had her back. That is her reality and the listeners and watchers out there can believe who they want to believe. “Everyone’s done more than enough. We’ve sacrificed a lot to try and keep her in the program. She doesn’t want to be here any more. That’s her choice and we need to move on without her.” O’Hea did say the Sparks appeared a good fit for Cambage. “She’s always wanted to be in LA,” she said. “I think she’s happy that she’s there, and when she’s happy she plays really good basketball.” The Opals struggled without Cambage in Tokyo but O’Hea said with proper preparation Sandy Brondello’s outfit would play to its ranking – which has long fluctuated between No 2 and No 3 in the world – at Sydney’s World Cup.
