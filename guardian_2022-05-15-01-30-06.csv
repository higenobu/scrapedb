5/15/2022,"On 24 July 2019, Boris Johnson stood outside 10 Downing Street and delivered his first speech as prime minister. Among the many pledges he made was a promise that he was going “to liberate the UK’s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti-genetic modification rules”. Such a move would allow the nation to “develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world”, he added. Almost three years later, Johnson’s government has eventually got round to outlining, in last week’s Queen’s speech, how it hopes to achieve this goal. This will be done through the forthcoming genetic technology (precision breeding) bill. The proposed legislation has been welcomed by leading UK biologists, although they also warned last week that a long battle lies ahead before UK plant and animal science is at a stage to save the world. “This bill will let us take a few baby steps,” said Prof Nick Talbot of the Sainsbury Laboratory, a plant research institute based in Norfolk. “It is good news, of course, but we will still need a lot more public debate about the issues involved before we can really progress.” Examples of the problems that lie ahead are illustrated by novel products created by UK scientists, such as blight-resistant potatoes and crops rich in omega-3 nutrients. These are still unlikely to get approval through the proposed new regulatory framework and will remain stalled in the regulation purgatory that has enclosed them for the past few years. A basic problem is that there are two different genetic technologies that are used to create new crop varieties. The first is known as genetic manipulation (GM) and typically involves taking an entire gene from one plant and inserting it into another. In this way, the host plant acquires the characteristic displayed by the original plant – protection against a particular disease, for example. Developed in the 1990s, GM crops became the focus of virulent campaigning that was based on the unfounded claim that “Frankenfoods” made from such plants were “unnatural” and a danger to health and the environment. The second technology is more recent and is known as gene editing. Two of its creators, French researcher Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, from the US, won the 2020 Nobel prize in chemistry for their work on developing CRISPR-Cas9, a key gene-editing technique. It allows scientists to alter the makeup of a gene without adding new DNA. They merely tinker with an organism’s existing genetic makeup, allowing them to create crop strains with new attributes – such as drought resistance – but without adding genetic material. It is this technique that was highlighted in the Queen’s speech last week. By contrast, GM technology is unlikely to be included, scientists have concluded. “The government seems to be saying there is a problem with GM plants but these nice gene-edited crops will be exempt and not caught up in tight regulation,” said Prof Jonathan Jones, who is also based at the Sainsbury Laboratory. For two decades, Jones and his team have worked to create a blight-resistant potato known as the PiperPlus. In every respect it is identical to the Maris Piper, the most commonly grown potato in the UK – except for one key difference. It is resistant to blight, a devastating agricultural scourge that costs UK farmers tens of millions of pounds every year. “Farmers have to spray their fields 15 times a year to protect their potatoes,” Jones told the Observer. “Their tractors spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and compact the soil in the fields, and the chemicals they spray can get into the water supply.” The PiperPlus could sidestep these issues – but faces a major problem: it was created by GM technology and, at present, there are no signs the new bill will provide a regulatory framework for approving plants created this way. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the new bill will create a regulatory regime for plants and animals that “have genetic changes that could have arisen through traditional breeding or natural processes”. That definition would allow gene-edited crops and animals to be raised on UK farms but not those derived from GM techniques. Thus crop varieties are still going to be regulated not on their properties, but on the method used to create them. “Regulation of genetic technologies should be based on the outcome of any genetic changes rather than the current focus on the technology used to make a genetic change,” warned Prof Dame Linda Partridge, vice-president of the Royal Society. This point was backed by Prof Johnathan Napier, of Rothamsted Research. “The problem is that GM is a more powerful technology. There are some things that gene editing cannot do but GM can, and that is going to be a problem if we want to develop new strains of crops that can withstand droughts and heatwaves and also provide us with new sources of nutrition.” As an example, Napier pointed to his team’s work in creating plants that make omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients have been shown to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and may also play protective roles in cancer and other conditions. The world’s principal source of omega-3 nutrients is fish, but as global stocks dwindle, the planet faces a critical shortage. “Our omega-3 crops have been trialled and tested and would be a solution but are considered tainted because they were created using GM techniques,” added Napier. “We need the government to kickstart a new approach to plant science. This bill should be seen as just a start to that process.” Other scientists were careful to stress the benefits of creating regulations for controlling the release of genetically edited crops and animals. At the Roslin Institute, outside Edinburgh, scientists have used this technology to delete sections of a gene in pigs, a move that has created a breed that is resistant to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, a serious ailment that can cause widespread deaths on pig farms. “We have been working on creating resistant pigs this way and are now ready to pass it on to breeding companies, so this proposed legislation comes at a very good time,” said Prof Alan Archibald, who is based at Roslin. “We could also consider using this technology to breed pigs that are resistant to African Swine Fever, a major killer across the world.” Roslin’s work raises another issue, however. The new legislation outlined in the Queen’s speech will apply only to England. Scotland has devolved control of such regulations, and given that the SNP maintains its majority control in the Scottish government through a coalition with the Green party, it is not at all certain that similar legislation will be passed north of the border. As Archibald put it: “It could get messy.” In short, the UK is still a long way from liberating its “extraordinary bioscience sector”, although an encouraging start has been made. What is also clear is the urgency of the need to pursue new plant and animal research and ensure new products get into fields and farms as soon as possible. As scientists have warned, the world’s population is likely to reach 10 billion by 2050 and new disease-resistant strains of crops and breeds of farm animals will be needed to feed the world. At the same time, global heating threatens to devastate crops as the world warms up. Crops that can survive droughts are also urgently needed, say researchers. “Agriculture has a major impact on the environment,” said Prof Dale Sanders, director of the John Innes Centre in Norfolk. “It produces far more carbon emissions than the aviation industry, for example. In addition, fertilisers are made from fossil fuels and, along with pesticides, they can also have a major, damaging effrect on local ecology. Only science can save us from these sorts of problems.”",News/Environment,Disease-resistant pigs and oily plants – why UK scientists seek to alter food genes,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/14/uk-scientists-food-gene-editing-genetic-technology
5/15/2022,"Nottingham Forest are in control of their Championship playoff semi-final with Sheffield United after goals from Jack Colback and Brennan Johnson gave them a deserved lead heading into Tuesday’s return leg at the City Ground. Forest, who narrowly missed out on automatic promotion in the final week of the Championship season, are now favourites to reach the final at Wembley later this month after deservedly beating the hosts here, though a late goal credited to Sander Berge means the second leg is no formality. Forest will perhaps be wondering how they are not even further ahead at the halfway stage of this tie. The visitors had a litany of chances throughout the course of a pulsating encounter but could only convert two, and Berge’s stoppage-time goal means the tie is still firmly in the balance. Sheffield United have never won a playoff campaign in eight attempts, and they still face an uphill task to keep their hopes of an instant return to the Premier League alive. They were much improved after half-time here, having been dominated by Forest in the first half, but ultimately were left to rue individual errors from Ben Osborn and John Egan which directly led to Forest’s two goals. Steve Cooper’s side were exceptional in a one-sided first half at Bramall Lane. They led when Colback fired home from close-range after Philip Zinckernagel was denied by Wes Foderingham following a slip in the area from Osborn. However, they could and perhaps should have been further ahead by the interval with a litany of chances coming their way. Foderingham produced a wonderful point-blank save to deny Sam Surridge, Ryan Yates headed wide from six yards out before Foderingham made another double save which prevented both Johnson and Surridge from making it 2-0 before the break as the pressure intensified on Paul Heckingbottom’s side. However, despite the hosts returning from half-time much the better of the two sides, they were unable to make any of their initial pressure count. And as the game entered the final quarter, Forest struck a potentially decisive blow as Egan dallied with the ball on halfway, allowing Joe Lolley to go through on goal. His shot was blocked by John Fleck but only into the path of Johnson, who cooly converted past Foderingham to put Forest in control of the tie. However, Sheffield United scrambled home a corner in injury time to halve their deficit ahead of the second leg in Nottingham.",Sport/Football,Colback and Johnson give Nottingham Forest first-leg win at Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/sheffield-united-nottingham-forest-championship-playoff-match-report
5/15/2022,"Penalty joy for Toulouse in Dublin last week but little more than punishment seven days on. Leinster produced one of the most emphatic performances in recent European history to sink the defending champions Toulouse and reach a sixth final. It was every bit as dominant as the scoreline suggests and while the Aviva Stadium was a sea of blue, having been painted Munster red seven days ago, it might as well have been green. For Leinster are a Test side in all but name. Indeed, Leinster lined up with 13 Ireland internationals in their starting lineup and the same number of players in their squad who featured against France in Paris earlier this year. Toulouse do not exactly lack Test players themselves but for all their counterattacking threats, their star man at scrum-half in Antoine Dupont, they simply could not live with Leinster’s power and poise. Leinster scored four tries, two coming from James Lowe who is now just one behind Chris Ashton’s season record of 11. They were destructive at the breakdown, swarming with the intent that the recent champions sides of Saracens used to, and with Josh van der Flier further enhancing his reputation as one of the finest opensides around. But above all else there was a slickness to Leinster’s play that Toulouse could not handle. Johnny Sexton enjoyed the kind of afternoon a fly-half of his calibre should with his side enjoying so much quick ball. Indeed, whether it be flat passes to the oncoming Garry Ringrose or pinpoint crossfield kicks to his back three, his was a supreme showing. It was the sort of performance that will resonate all the way to Lens, where Racing 92 face La Rochelle on Sunday for the right to face Leinster in the final later this month. It remains to be seen whether Tadhg Furlong will be fit for that match, the Ireland tighthead prop limping off after 17 minutes having already demonstrated his delightful dexterity with some lovely short passes and a spectacular long-range ball to Hugo Keenan on the left. Keenan darted his way into the Toulouse 22 but Jamison Gibson-Park’s grubber was seized upon by Dupont, who found himself with a clear run to the try-line. If it was a reminder of the dangers Toulouse pose, it was also a wake-up call for Leinster, who responded with tries from Lowe and Van der Flier before half-time as well as two more Sexton penalties after he had opened the scoring from the tee. Furlong’s departure did give Toulouse the ascendancy at the scrum and with it a foothold but they were unable to add to the scoreboard beyond a Tomas Ramos penalty. Dupont flickered in glimpses but a prolonged period before half-time in which they went through phase after phase around halfway before a wayward pass, which went straight into touch, summed up their opening half. Emmanuel Meafou was in the sin-bin by this stage, his frustration evidently getting the better of him. Toulouse’s luck continued to be out after the restart – Jack Conan was fortunate to escape a yellow card for a trip on Romain Ntamack but if the French side will feel they did not get their share of the decisions from the referee Karl Dickson they would have to accept that was not the reason why they lost. Lowe’s second try came with half an hour still to play – a walkover effort after Sexton’s long pass – and while Toulouse responded with a close-range try from a driving maul through Selevasio Tolofua the game, in truth, was long since up for the French side, whose handling let them down too many times throughout. Ross Byrne’s penalty with five minutes to go was a show of respect for the champions, taking the gap beyond 14 points, but Keenan’s late try – just desserts for his performances – put the exclamation point on Leinster’s dominance.",Sport/Sport,James Lowe at the double in Leinster’s Champions Cup demolition of Toulouse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/leinster-toulouse-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
5/15/2022,"Ukrainians fleeing the war are being housed with UK hosts who have not had a criminal record check, in the latest concern to blight the government’s response to the refugee crisis. Under increasing pressure to iron out flaws in its schemes, government sources told the Observer they were creating a “rematching” service to house Ukrainians with people willing to help. Tens of thousands of people who have registered an interest with the UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme will be contacted to say the government is working with councils and charities to match them with Ukrainians who have arrived in the UK but find themselves homeless after their initial place fell through or family members could not host them. So far, more than 102,000 visas have been issued under the two government refugee schemes for Ukrainians, and 46,100 have arrived in the UK. Teething problems continue to beset the initiatives. In many cases, people have been housed for weeks by hosts who still are waiting for their Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. Karen Liebreich, from west London, collected her 21-year-old Ukrainian refugee from the airport five weeks ago but said she was still waiting for the results of the checks. She said: “My husband and I have now filled in our forms for the DBS checks, but she has been here for five weeks and we still haven’t been approved.” The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities – which is responsible for the scheme – contacted her last week to ask if it could use her as a case study, but Liebreich refused. In an email to the department, she said: “[Your] department was all over the press assuring us that everyone housing a Ukrainian has had a completed DBS check. As this is a categoric lie ... I’m not prepared to facilitate an interview to bolster a government message for ministers that seem not to understand the value of the truth.” A DBS check allows employers and other organisations to look at the criminal record of someone applying for a role, if they have one. On Thursday another host of a Ukrainian mother and son in Essex also said they had arrived but that she “hadn’t been checked” and had asked the council for an explanation. Another host from Essex wrote on Facebook: “Our guests, including young child, arrived on 14 April and we were only sent the links for the enhanced DBS check last Friday [6 May].” Essex county council said the delays had arisen due to the “volume” of cases but that it was “prioritising those who already have guests with them”, and last week started face-to-face DBS checks at two offices to “speed things up further”. In response to such issues and concerns over homelessness, a parliamentary committee will this week urge the government to sort out its “completely dysfunctional” schemes. Clive Betts, chair of the levelling-up committee, said he had written to refugees minister Richard Harrington, about fears for the safety of Ukrainians and their potential to end up homeless. Maggie Filipova-Rivers, of the City of Sanctuary network of 120 local councils, said the delay between Ukrainians being housed and DBS checks conducted on their host was worrying. She highlighted one recent case where a family in Worcester were at risk of becoming homeless after problems arose with their host. “Someone was hosting a family living on a mattress in the kitchen and asking them for money; it was a potential exploitation case,” said Filipova-Rivers. Worcester city council said that although no safety issues had been identified in this case, it had found the property to be “unsuitable”. But the host had ignored this and gone ahead with the placement. Then the council had become aware of “problems in the relationship between sponsor and their guests” – the Ukrainian family had appealed for help on Facebook, which led to a support group providing alternative accommodation in Derby and then Sheffield. Misha Lagodinsky, who runs a matching scheme called UK Welcomes Ukraine, which has 100 Ukrainian- and Russian-speaking volunteers connecting people, said: “Some people are finding that they are homeless straight away because they have a visa granted and then their host fails DBS checks.” Charlie Richards, a volunteer with another scheme, said that he had heard of Ukrainian families sleeping on benches after becoming homeless. Concerns have been building over the failure of the government to release the data it holds on the number of Ukrainians presenting themselves to councils as homeless. A source said it was due to unveil the data shortly, and that numbers relating to the Homes for Ukraine scheme were “very small so far”. They added that the intention was never to carry out DBS checks on all hosts before Ukrainians arrived because the priority was getting people “out of danger” first. A government spokesperson said: “The Homes for Ukraine scheme has stringent safeguarding measures in place, and the Home Office conducts security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued. Councils also conduct checks and must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor’s property.”",News/UK news,Ukraine refugees staying with UK hosts not cleared by criminal record checks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/ukraine-refugees-staying-with-uk-hosts-not-cleared-by-criminal-record-checks

Plenty of such delicious noise in Radio 4’s Time Flies, a half-hour documentary about Roman and Maz Piekarski, brothers who own the largest collection of cuckoo clocks in the world. They live near Knutsford in Cheshire, close to where I was brought up: their soothing, familiarly accented voices, plus the ticking clocks, was a reverie that made me smile. The brothers aren’t completely happy though. Cuckooland, as their collection is called, once welcomed hundreds of visitors, but Covid changed that. More fundamentally, the Piekarskis, who are in their late 60s, are worried about what will happen to their collection after they’re gone. “We get people like you come to see us,” said Maz, “and you all come in with the enthusiasm: ‘Oh what a fantastic place!’ But then you go away. And we’re just left behind again… ” Maz is the more talkative. He was told he would die in his 20s, but he’s still here. “It feels like yesterday we moved in here… Where’s my life gone, what’ve I been doing? Make the most of the time, that’s the saying that my brother and I think is the most important.” A delightful, philosophical listen from Michael Segalov and the ever-brilliant Eleanor McDowall. Not quite so gentle, but just as carefully soundscaped, is RadioMan, a new 10-part drama from Audible. This is essentially a whodunnit: a character drama meets murder mystery. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays Chas Vincent Jones, a true-crime podcaster on the trail of a serial killer of local women (it’s based on a real case from Macedonia), alongside other acting heavyweights such as David Morrissey and Cathy Tyson. There’s a lot packed into RadioMan: twists, red herrings, flashbacks, a couple of nastier moments, real-life news and music. The intense, layered soundscaping – by production supremo Benbrick, using more than 4,000 audio tracks – is dazzling, driving the plot forward. The reveal, again based on the actual case, is unexpected and, for me, a little unsatisfying, but this is a strikingly ambitious drama that rewards immersion. Listen on headphones. While we’re talking true-crime drama, Fun Kids has brought out a new one aimed at tweens. In Truthdiggers, Alfie (Mack Keith-Roach) and Morgana (Tillie Amartey) are young podcast-makers trying to track down Odd Colin, who disappeared from their home town in 1972. The first episode is pacy and engaging, and I like the keep-’em-coming twist at the end; listeners can vote on Alfie and Morgana’s next interviewee, thus affecting the following episode’s story. Nicely done. Equally jolly is new podcast series The Spying Game, hosted by Rory Bremner and produced by Cup & Nuzzle, a studio that has built a reputation for excellent spy-based shows (True Spies, The Great James Bond Car Robbery, For Your Ears Only). Last December’s preview episode, with the author Anthony Horowitz and ex-US intelligence officer Shawnee Delaney, was chatty and fun, and last week’s first episode proper was very similar, featuring author Ben Macintyre and former British intelligence operative Julian Fisher. Together, they recounted the real-life story behind Macintyre’s bestselling Operation Mincemeat (also now a film). This pairing – of voluble, enthusiastic writer with drier, informed ex-spy – is working well, and Bremner is a great host, prodding and stepping back as needed. Finally – a sadly appropriate word – last week’s You, Me and the Big C was an immensely moving affair, with producer Mike Holt speaking one last time, via video link, with brave Deborah James, who, aged just 40, is in the last few weeks of her life. James was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 bowel cancer in 2016; she has been co-hosting the podcast since then, cheerfully plugging away with her treatment, somehow dodging the inevitable. This year, her life has become much harder, as anyone who has listened to her podcasts from hospital will know. Now, tragically, her body has stopped responding to treatment and she has moved to her parents’ house for palliative care. James is a fantastic communicator and broadcaster – even now, even as she fades – honest, devastating, detailed (“You think you’ve been asleep for four hours and it’s been 10 minutes”; “I’ve had five years knowing this would happen and it’s still shocking”). And, like Maz and Roman in their cuckoo-clock world, she wants us to understand. “Please enjoy life,” she said. “Life is so precious… All I want is more time and more life.” Then, because she is who she is: “Oh, and also: check your poo.” If she wants that phrase to be her final words, who are we to argue? Enjoy life, lovely readers.

5/15/2022,"The British government ran a secret “black propaganda” campaign for decades, targeting Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia with leaflets and reports from fake sources aimed at destabilising cold war enemies by encouraging racial tensions, sowing chaos, inciting violence and reinforcing anti-communist ideas, newly declassified documents have revealed. The effort, run from the mid-1950s through to the late 70s by a unit in London that was part of the Foreign Office, was focused on cold war enemies such as the Soviet Union and China, leftwing liberation groups and leaders that the UK saw as threats to its interests The campaign also sought to mobilise Muslims against Moscow, promoting greater religious conservatism and radical ideas. To appear authentic, documents encouraged hatred of Israel. Recently declassified British government documents reveal hundreds of extensive and costly operations. “These releases are among the most important of the past two decades. It’s very clear now that the UK engaged in more black propaganda than historians assume and these efforts were more systemic, ambitious and offensive. Despite official denials, [this] went far beyond merely exposing Soviet disinformation,” said Rory Cormac, an expert in the history of subversion and intelligence who found the material when researching his new book, How to Stage a Coup: And Ten Other Lessons from the World of Secret Statecraft, to be published next month. The Information Research Department (IRD) was set up by the post-second world war Labour government to counter Soviet propaganda attacks on Britain. Its activities mirrored the CIA’s cold war propaganda operations and the extensive efforts of the USSR and its satellites. The Observer last year revealed the IRD’s major campaign in Indonesia in 1965 that helped encourage anti-communist massacres which left hundreds of thousands dead. There, the IRD prepared pamphlets purporting to be written by Indonesian patriots, but in fact were created by British propagandists, calling on Indonesians to eliminate the PKI, then the biggest communist party in the non-communist world. But the thousands of declassified documents studied by Cormac give by far the most extensive insight yet into the IRD’s disinformation operations. “The British were only one actor among many, and a fairly minor actor too, compared with the quantity of material being produced and disseminated by the bigger players,” said Cormac, professor of international relations at Nottingham University. “The UK did not simply invent material, as the Soviets systematically did, but they definitely intended to deceive audiences in order to get the message across.” The IRD employed 360 people at its height in the mid-60s. However, its highly secretive Special Editorial Unit, responsible for the black propaganda effort, was much smaller. From its base in a nondescript office in Westminster, the unit used a variety of tactics to manipulate opinion. One was to produce “reports” sent to warn other governments, selected journalists and thinktanks about “Soviet subversion” or similar threats. The reports comprised carefully selected facts and analysis often gleaned from intelligence provided by Britain’s security services, but appeared to come from ostensibly independent analysts and institutions that were in reality set up and run by the IRD. One of the first of these, set up in 1964, was the International Committee for the Investigation of Communist Front Organisations. Another tactic was to forge statements by official Soviet institutions and agencies. Between 1965 and 1972, the IRD forged at least 11 statements from Novosti, the Soviet state-run news agency. One followed Egypt’s defeat in the 1967 six-day war against Israel and underlined Soviet anger at Egypt’s “waste” of so much of the arms and materiel Moscow had supplied to the country. The IRD also forged literature purporting to come from the Muslim Brotherhood, a mass Islamist organisation that had a significant following across the Middle East. One pamphlet accused Moscow of encouraging the 1967 war, criticised the quality of Soviet military equipment, and called the Soviets “filthy-tongued atheists” who saw the Egyptians as little more than “peasants who lived all their lives nursing reactionary Islamic superstitions”. The IRD also created an entirely fictive radical Islamist organisation called the League of Believers, which attacked the Russians as non-believers and blamed Arab defeats on a lack of religious faith, a standard trope among religious conservatives at the time. “Why is the Arab nation at this time afflicted by so much sorrow and disaster? Why were the brave forces defeated in the jihad by the evil heathen Zionists?… The answers are [easily] to be found … we are departing fast from the right path, we are following the course chosen for us by the communist-atheists for whom religion is a form of social disease,” it read. Such claims became increasingly widespread in Egypt in the ensuing years, as a resurgence of religion swept the key strategic state. Nor was the IRD above encouraging opposition to Israel if it made its forgeries more convincing, Cormac told the Observer. A statement released by the IRD in February 1967 also purported to come from the Muslim Brotherhood, and attacked Egypt for using chemical weapons in its battle against a coalition of religious conservatives and tribes in Yemen backed by Britain and Saudi Arabia. The IRD’s leaflets echoed other claims made by radical Islamists, arguing that military misdeeds should not be blamed on “the atheists or the imperialists or the Zionist Jews” but on “Egyptians who are supposed to be believers”. “These Egyptian murderers have gone too far in their hypocrisy unpunished, but they can no longer pretend to be believers in God and in His Prophet and in His sacred book,” a leaflet read, asking: “If the Egyptians have to go to war and fight, why don’t they direct their armies against the Jews?” Cormac said that, as with much of the IRD’s output, the claims made were factually accurate, but the tone and fake source were designed to mislead. The leaflets about Yemen aimed to put pressure on the Egyptian leadership to accept a ceasefire. Other material highlighted the poor view that Moscow took of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the limited aid offered by the Soviets to Palestinian armed nationalist groups. This was contrasted with the more supportive stance of the Chinese, in a bid to widen the split between the two communist powers. One major initiative focused on undermining Ian Smith’s regime in Rhodesia, the former colony that unilaterally declared its independence from the UK in 1965 in an attempt to maintain white minority rule. The IRD set up a fake group of white Rhodesians who opposed Smith. Its leaflets attacked him for lying, creating “chaos” and crippling the economy. “The whole world is against us … We must call a halt while we can still save our country,” one said. Attempts to isolate African nationalists sometimes involved incitement of racial tension. In early 1963, the IRD forged a statement from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, a Soviet front organisation, which denounced Africans as uncivilised, “primitive” and morally weak. The forgery received press coverage across the continent, with many newspapers reacting intemperately. A similar forgery in 1966 underlined the “backwardness” and “political immaturity” of Africa. Another, a statement purportedly from Novosti, blamed poor academic results at an international university in Moscow on the quality of the black African students enrolled there. The IRD sent more than 1,000 copies to addresses across the developing world. Cormac said there is little doubt that senior British policymakers knew about the IRD’s work. In 1964, the Conservative prime minister, Alec Douglas-Home, told the IRD to target Ghana over fear that its mercurial president, Kwame Nkrumah, was tilting towards Moscow. Months later, the new Labour foreign secretary, Patrick Gordon Walker, encouraged the Foreign Office to maintain a “black propaganda potential and from time to time produce black material”. Walker was particularly interested in fomenting racial tensions between Africans and the Chinese. As with most such efforts, the impact of the IRD’s campaigns was often difficult to judge. On one occasion, IRD officials were able to report that a newspaper in Zanzibar printed one of their forgeries about Soviet racism, and that the publication prompted an angry response. This was seen as a major achievement. Officials were also pleased when Kenyan press used fake material about the 1967 six-day war, and when newspapers across much of the Islamic world printed a fake Novosti bulletin on the conflict. Occasionally, western newspapers unwittingly used IRD materials, too. Though the IRD was shut down in 1977, researchers are now finding evidence that similar efforts continued for almost another decade. “The [new documents] are particularly significant as a precursor to more modern efforts of putting intelligence into the public domain. “Liz Truss has a ’government information cell’, and defence intelligence sends out daily tweets to ‘pre-but’ Russian plots and gain the upper hand in the information war, but for much of the cold war the UK used far more devious means,” Cormac said.",News/World news,Secret British ‘black propaganda’ campaign targeted cold war enemies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/secret-british-black-propaganda-campaign-targeted-cold-war-enemies-information-research-department
5/15/2022,"A dozen US oil refineries last year exceeded the federal limit on average benzene emissions. Among the 12 refineries that emitted above the maximum level for benzene, five were in Texas, four in Louisiana, and one each in Pennsylvania, Indiana and the US Virgin Islands, a new analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project revealed on Thursday. Benzene is a known carcinogen that is highly toxic and volatile when exposed to air. Much of the excess emissions come through leaks from valves, tanks, pumps and other means that are hard to detect. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates 6.1 million people in the US live within three miles of a refinery, with low-income people and people of color represented at rates nearly twice that of the general population. Out of 129 operable oil refineries in 2021, 118 reported benzene concentration registered at or near the site, otherwise known as the fence-line. Nearly half of these refineries released benzene levels above 3 micrograms per cubic meter, which the Environmental Integrity Project defines as a long-term potential health threat. The EPA requires facilities to take action if they exceed an average 9 micrograms per cubic meter, or above “action level” emission of benzene. “If [facilities] can’t get their benzene below the action level, year after year, we really need to see enforcement from the EPA,” said Eric Schaeffer, the executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, in a press conference. “You need to start paying penalties when your fence-line levels persist,” he added. Lifetime exposure to benzene at levels as low as 0.13 microgram per cubic meter could cause a risk of up to one additional cancer case for every one million exposed, according to the EPA. The higher the level of benzene, the higher the health risk. Marathon Petroleum’s Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City had the highest average net benzene levels in 2021, according to the analysis of the self-reported data. Roughly 37,000 people live within a three-mile radius of the refinery. Among them, 62% are people of color and 47% are low-income. “This analysis provides important insight into why the Houston area is an industrial cancer hotspot,” said Leticia Gutierrez of advocacy group Air Alliance Houston, at the press conference. “People living near these facilities have greater [exposure] to lifetime cancer risk than any other part of the state, yet the regulatory agencies responsible for protecting us continue to approve permits for these facilities,” Gutierrez said. Environmental Integrity Project notes that its analysis did not measure concentrations of benzene within neighborhoods adjacent to refineries, and does not reflect the actual levels of benzene within the communities. In a statement to the Guardian, EPA spokesperson Taylor wrote that the agency is actively engaged in reviewing the benzene fence-line data, and has “initiated several investigations of facilities to determine the reason for the elevated benzene emissions”.",News/Environment,"US oil refineries spewing cancer-causing benzene into communities, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/us-oil-refineries-benzene-pollution-cancer-causing

5/15/2022,"It wasn’t so long ago that Måneskin were busking on the streets of Rome, performing for four hours straight even if only one person was watching. So the 2021 Eurovision song contest winners couldn’t believe their luck when the Rolling Stones invited them to open a concert in the US in November, giving them their first opportunity to perform in front of an audience of thousands. “We thought, fuck yeah, we’re not going to decline that,” bassist Victoria De Angelis said in an interview with the Guardian alongside her three bandmates in Turin before the Eurovision 2022 final. “Our lives have completely changed [since Eurovision]. We haven’t stopped. We’ve been having a lot of crazy experiences … all the things we dreamed of that we never thought would come true.” For the most part, Eurovision winners tend to be swiftly forgotten about. But since their show-stopping performance of Zitti e Buoni in Rotterdam last May, Måneskin have not only achieved an unrivalled level of global success for an Italian rock band, they are inspiring a generation of young people with their upbeat rock and profound lyrics. “We are super privileged, but when we started out in music we experienced some tough times. We were being super judged – for our makeup, nail polish and how we dressed – that it was hard to keep going,” said frontman Damiano David. “So we try to be as authentic as possible, to share our experiences and hope that our music and the way we are can inspire someone and make them feel less lonely in the world.” The band will perform their new single, Supermodel, a song inspired by the personalities they met in Los Angeles, at the Eurovision final on Saturday. “We tried to make a funny critique about all these fake people trying to get to Hollywood,” said David. “It’s as if they get stuck in their character and start to act in a very weird way. At least that’s how we saw it … it was our main topic of conversation when we were there, and ended up being the topic of the song because I always try to write about something that I’m actually living.” David, De Angelis and guitarist Thomas Raggi met as students in Rome, while drummer Ethan Torchio joined the group after responding to an inquiry on a Facebook page. Raggi recalled the energy the band felt even if just 10 people watched as they busked on the Via del Corso, Rome’s main shopping thoroughfare. “We played as if we were in front of 10,000 people,” he said. David added: “We would get about €20, enough to go to McDonald’s.” A brief low point came when David was accused of snorting cocaine during the Eurovision final last year. He tested negative in a drugs test, but French broadcaster Stéphane Bern told the BBC this week that as the votes rolled in, he received a text message from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, telling him that Måneskin had to be disqualified over what turned out to be baseless allegations. “It’s the funniest thing that has happened to me,” said David. “And I feel that if a president tried to get us excluded, then it must mean we’re really important.” Måneskin’s other successes over the past year include three hits in the UK Top 40 singles chart (they were the first Italian band to make it into the Top 10 with Zitti e Buoni), a sellout tour in the US and a song with Iggy Pop. The band hopes the next year will continue with the same momentum. David puts their success down to being authentic. “We have found that being ourselves is the winning strategy,” he said.",Arts/Music,Eurovision 2021 winners Måneskin: ‘Our lives have completely changed’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/14/eurovision-2021-winners-maneskin-our-lives-have-completely-changed
