12/14/2021,"A homeowner on TikTok fascinated her followers with the “deadly” staircase that connects her bedroom with her kitchen. Kim Tierney (@bloomfieldfarm) and her husband bought Bloomfield Farm in 2018. The house was built in 1774 and abandoned for the past 50 years or so. The couple decided to take on Bloomfield as a major DIY restoration project and tried to keep as much of the original pieces of the house as possible. Since then, the couple has updated their 237,000 TikTok followers with tours of the home. In one video that caught a lot of attention, Tierney explained that in addition to the main staircase, there was another way for her to get downstairs in the mornings — by “traveling the dangerous Victorian stairs.” Constructed in 1890 for use by the cook & servant who lived above #danger #victorian #edwardian #interior #interiordesign #oldhouse #oldhousetiktok “Victorian stairs could be referred to as ‘hidden killers,'” Tierney explained in the TikTok’s text. “Made too narrow, made too steep, with irregular steps.” Tierney added that these stairs were for the servants and other staff to travel out of sight throughout the house. Plus, to keep the rooms bigger and save space, families would build the staircase against code. Historic building consultant Nathan Gros told Absolute History that the back staircase was “built of the cheapest softwood you could possibly buy — you’d be lucky if there [were] handrails.” “Safety really wasn’t high on the agenda,” Gros said. “Total death traps.” Based on studies, Absolute History also noted that someone is six times more likely to fall walking down the servants’ steps than a regular, properly measured staircase. Not only was the staircase steeper, but the individual steps were uneven. When Tierney filmed herself walking down the staircase, she pointed how she had to turn sideways to walk down. “Add the weight of trays or the complication of long skirts could easily prove fatal,” she wrote. Even without the trays or a long skirt, Tierney had to hold onto the walls to guide herself safely down the staircase. Commenters were stunned by the staircase especially. As one user put it, “If my server is bringing me food, I would like them to continue to live.” “I work in an old mansion with these stairways!” another person said. “They are atrocious.” “Sometimes I wonder how anyone survived the Victoria era,” someone pointed out. “What with dangerous stairs and toxic wallpaper.” Meet Molly!

12/14/2021,"Trump yelled ""what the hell was that?"" after the White House's rollout of its Middle East plan. Journalist and author Barak Ravid described the reactions in the White House in an interview with the Forward. Trump and his aides felt rolled by Netanyahu's eagerness to immediately annex parts of the West Bank. Former President Donald Trump yelled, ""what the hell was that?"" at his aides after the White House's January 2020 unveiling of the White House's Middle East peace plan went off the rails, the author of a forthcoming book on US-Israel relations told the Forward. Axios journalist Barak Ravid's book ""Trump's Peace: The Abraham Accords and the Reshaping of the Middle East,"" which goes inside the US-Israel relationship during the Trump years. Trump heavily emphasized cultivating a close relationship with Israel and then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and put his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who already had a previous relationship with Netanyahu, in charge of the White House's Middle East relations. Trump's relationship with Netanyahu had already soured leading up to the rollout, Ravid told the Forward, with Trump feeling like some of his pro-Israel moves, including recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights from Syria and moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, hadn't been sufficiently appreciated and reciprocated by Netanyahu. In early 2020, the Trump administration unveiled a ""peace plan"" for the Middle East. The so-called ""Deal of the Century"" involved no discussions with Palestinian leaders, and they promptly rejected it. Critics said it was misleading to call it a ""peace plan,"" dismissing it as little more than a PR stunt for Netanyahu ahead of an election. ""There was no meaningful consultation with the Palestinians over the past two years, and the result is a plan that would be very difficult for any Palestinian leader to accept and defend to their people,"" Dan Shapiro, the US ambassador to Israel under former President Barack Obama, told Insider at the time. The plan, crafted by Kushner, overwhelmingly favored Israel on a number of contentious issues. Among other elements, the plan pledged to keep Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital, recognized Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the occupied West Bank considered illegal under international law, and stipulated that Israel would provide for Palestine's security. After several months of plan being put on hold partly by Netanyahu's inability to form a government, the two leaders finally unveiled it on January 28, 2020, at the White House. But things didn't exactly go as planned. And at the event itself, as the Forward put it, ""Netanyahu caused an uproar by suggesting the U.S. initiative was a green light for the annexation of the occupied West Bank."" Even though the peace plan opened the door for Israeli to eventually annex around a third of the West Bank for security or religious reasons, the White House ""was not ready to endorse an immediate unilateral annexation,"" The New York Times put it at the time.  Another former Trump official told Ravid that in their view, Netanyahu used Trump ""as a flowerpot"" at the ceremony for his own political gain. Israel, under pressure from the Trump administration, later delayed plans to move forward with the annexation of the West Bank ahead of its March 2020 elections. The relations between the two leaders reached its worst point after the 2020 election, when Trump was enraged over Netanyahu acknowledging President Joe Biden's victory, telling Ravid, ""fuck him"" in an interview for the book. ""I think that when Trump speaks about loyalty, I don't think that he speaks only about the congratulations to Biden,"" Ravid told the Forward. ""It was a broader expectation that Netanyahu would give him the same political support domestically that he gave him in Israel.""
