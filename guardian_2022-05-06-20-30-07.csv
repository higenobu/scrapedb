5/6/2022,"Sir Martin Sorrell has described the twice-delayed reporting of S4 Capital’s annual results as “unacceptable and embarrassing” and pledged to restore investor confidence in the advertising group after almost $1bn (£810m) was wiped off its market value. S4 Capital, the digitally-led ad group Sorrell launched after resigning from WPP four years ago, was forced to delay the publication of its results twice after its auditors, PwC, said it was “unable to complete the work necessary”. The delays stoked investor fears, and for Sorrell, a finance man driven to make a success of S4 Capital after his bitter departure from WPP, the accounting delays have been a blow that also wiped £90m from the value of his stake in the business. “Delay in producing our 2021 results is unacceptable and embarrassing,” he told investors and analysts in a presentation on Friday. Reasons cited for the delay include control weaknesses, staff turnover and lack of detailed documentation, “particularly relating to revenue and cost of sales recognition”. Sorrell said an “upskilling” of the finance team was in progress, with a number of senior hires already made, as the number-crunching side of the operation attempts to keep up with the blistering pace of growth of S4 Capital. “Significant changes in our financial control, risk and governance structure and resources at board, company and practice level are being implemented and planned to try to ensure this never happens again and we return to a normal financial calendar,” Sorrell said. “[A] full debrief [is] planned to ensure all suggestions from PwC are captured.” S4 Capital reported a doubling of revenues to £686m last year. However, the company swung to a pre-tax loss of £56.7m after incurring £136.9m in charges relating to acquisitions, amortisation and share based payments. The company’s share price rose 4% to 339p on Friday but remains well down on the high of 870p in September last year. “S4 Capital’s results are solid but unspectacular,” said Thomas Singlehurst, a media analyst at Citi. “Our call on S4C was … that the delay to results would likely be procedural and, in this context, the market was overstating risk. We think this is borne out by today’s results and would expect a gradual rerating as the market reengages with fundamentals.”",News/Media,‘Unacceptable and embarrassing’: Sorrell criticises S4 Capital results delay,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/06/unacceptable-and-embarrassing-sorrell-criticises-s4-capital-results-delay
5/6/2022,"Bristol’s Labour mayor has suffered a blow after the city voted to end the role. Marvin Rees, the first person of black African heritage to become a directly elected mayor in a major European city, will serve out his current term, after which Bristol will return to a committee system. Opposition politicians, who argued that the role invested too much power in one person, hailed the result of the referendum on the mayoral role as a chance to reset democracy in the city. However, Rees said be believed the committee was a “very poor system” that would not tackle critical issues as effectively as a prominent, visible leader. He said: “I hope I am wrong, because certainly the city faces challenges and the city needs a leadership that can lead it in the face of the challenges and opportunities.” During the campaign, he said issues ranging from the response to the pandemic to the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston benefited from the clear type of leadership that the role of a directly elected mayor enabled. Rees, who was re-elected in May last year and had already said he would not run for a third time, denied the vote was a judgment on his time in office and said the referendum had been a “distraction” from more important issues, such as the cost of living crisis. The referendum was held after Liberal Democrat councillors proposed a motion for the vote, seconded by the Greens, with 59% of people voting for the role to be scrapped, and a turnout of 29%. The councillor Heather Mack, leader of the Green group, said it marked “a new chapter in the way our city is run” “For many years now, important decisions affecting the city have been made behind closed doors by just one person whom the public and elected councillors cannot easily challenge,” she said. “We look forward to a fairer, more open way of doing business where decisions are made collaboratively.” At last year’s council elections, the Greens became the joint biggest party in Bristol with Labour, and the party hoped Rees would share power. However, to their anger and frustration, the Greens were given no seats in Rees’s cabinet. Rees will serve out his term until 2024 at which point all councillors will be up for re-election. It seems unlikely that any party will win an overall majority, opening up the possibility of a coalition, possibly between Labour and the Greens. While Rees is seen by many, nationally and internationally, as an impressive figure, he also has detractors in Bristol, with some annoyed at his style of management and specific issues such as resident parking zones, the MetroBus transport scheme, and controversial plans for a new arena. Jos Clark, the leader of the Lib Dem council group, said she hoped for “more collaboration” under a “fairer system”. Mark Weston, the leader of the Conservative group, said: “The mayoral model has proven a disaster for Bristol – too much power at the whim of one individual.” The mayoral post was created in 2012, with the independent candidate George Ferguson becoming the first to occupy the role. Rees beat Ferguson in 2016.",News/UK news,Bristol votes to scrap directly elected mayoral role,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/06/bristol-votes-referendum-directly-elected-mayoral-role-marvin-rees
5/6/2022,"The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics are memorable for a lot of things – the jetpack at the opening ceremony, the historic performance by Carl Lewis, the greater focus on female athletes – but for nerds of a certain age, they will always be remembered for something quite different: broken joysticks. This was the first Olympic tournament of the mass video game era and it prompted a whole new genre of sports sims, designed to replicate the physical exertion of actually doing sport. I can just about recall watching the real Los Angeles games on TV, but it was the household tournaments I held with friends that really bring back memories. There’s some disagreement over where the multi-sport sim originated. At the burgeoning games studio Activision, pioneering designer David Crane had thought for a long time about making a sport game that simulated physical effort and his title The Activision Decathlon, arrived in late 1983, riding the growing hype for the LA Olympics to come. It allowed players to compete in 10 events, waggling the joystick left and right as quickly as possible to run faster and jump higher. At roughly the same time, Japanese company Konami brought the multi-event sports sims to the arcade with its brilliant coin-op Track and Field. This game allowed up to four players to compete in six athletics events, but instead of waggling a joystick, players used a two-button interface, alternatively pressing (or rather “bashing”) each one as quickly as possible. As the LA Olympics began, there was a sudden influx of new competitors. Along with home computer versions of The Activision Decathlon and Track and Field, we got Summer Games from US studio Epyx, which innovated on the formula by adding events such as diving and gymnastics that required timing and style rather than furious joystick waggles; and then there was the famed Daley Thompson’s Decathlon from Manchester-based Ocean software, with its chunky visuals and glorious soundtrack. In an era before mass household internet, these titles were the original multiplayer games, often allowing up to six friends to take part in epic, all-day tournaments. I can recall spending entire school holidays at my Commodore 64, surrounded by friends from my street, all trying to beat someone’s latest record in the pole vault or 110m hurdle, making our own world-record charts. I loved the way that, like genuine sports stars, we all discussed and developed our own techniques for play. We argued over the best joysticks for waggling – the hardy Competition Pro stick, based on the classic Atari design, was considered the crème de la crème for serious competitors (it was so good, we even considered a ban in our tournaments), while the showy but rather fragile Quickshot 2 could easily be wrenched in two during a particularly competitive 100m sprint. Later, when the excellent International Track and Field came to PlayStation, I was working for video game magazine publisher Future and every journalist in the building had their own approach to the button-mashing events. One colleague had a special cloth that he put over the buttons in order to provide optimal finger travel and reduce friction. No one thought he was taking it too seriously. Multi-sport games have always been about inclusivity, too (at least for able-bodied players). The simple controls and widely recognised events meant that almost anyone could play, without having to understand a lot of complicated instructions. With the release of Wii Sports in 2006, Nintendo took this concept to its logical conclusion, the console’s motion sensitive Wii remote providing tactile, gesture-driven control over events such as boxing, golf and tennis. Selling more than 80m copies, the game became a fixture of social gatherings, a means of closing the generation gap between the oldest and youngest members of a family. There is still a thriving Wii bowling league running in retirement homes throughout the US. I’ve always loved these games, especially the Epyx titles. I loved how they introduced me to new sports – the Canadian log rolling in World Games, the freestyle rollerskating in California Games – and how the controls have been refined over the years to take on board new technologies. It is also hard to overstate the impact that Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games had on a generation of players who grew up taking sides in that momentous rivalry. What a fine – yet also completely bizarre – symbol of the uniting power of sport. So it’s nice to see the newly released Nintendo Switch Sports introducing a new generation of players to the joy of multi-event sports games. They continue to challenge the hoary old stereotypes about games: that they’re antisocial and sedentary pursuits. Even in this era of Fortnite and Fifa Ultimate Team, there is fun to be had gathered around one screen in one place, competing to beat record scores, discussing techniques and tactics. It’s just that nowadays, we are not surrounded by a graveyard of knackered joysticks.",Arts/Games,Forty years of joystick waggling: the glory of multi-sport video games,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/06/forty-years-of-joystick-waggling-the-glory-of-multi-sport-video-games
5/6/2022,"Local election results mean three flagships have now been sunk in the past month: Westminster, Wandsworth, and the Moskva. Along with Barnet, the loss of those first two councils has contributed to the Conservatives’ London results being described as a “meltdown”, perhaps appropriately. During recent public appearances, Boris Johnson has looked like a novelty Boris Johnson candle left next to a radiator. Key to his survival will be the fact that you can’t afford to turn on the heating any more. In the capital, the prime minister is now about as popular as a no-fault eviction or eye contact on the tube. The Tories have even lost Mayfair, calling into question their strategy of impounding voters’ yachts. Outside London, it’s a rather more “mixed” picture for Labour. Keir Starmer prides himself on looking ready for court, but arguably needs to graduate from looking like the worried defendant in a photocopier-leasing scam. The real Beergate might turn out to be the fact that he doesn’t seem like the sort of guy people particularly want to have a beer with. One standout criticism you keep hearing is that Starmer’s “not going to set the world on fire” – a reminder that “Let’s burn it all down!” has actually been a vote-winner in the UK for the past few electoral cycles. At dawn, Labour were briefing the line that this was a “turning point election”, a description that really brings to life the 37-point-turn manoeuvre the party has been faultlessly executing since 2010. In news not unrelated to the above state of play for the two main parties, it was a very good night for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Looking ahead, set your watch for the “coalition of chaos” warnings from some of the most chaotic politicians outside of Rome’s first civil war. Back to the prime minister, though, and reports he told aides ahead of the count that “we are going to get our arse kicked tonight”. “Our” arse? It does feel par for the course that Johnson is unable to take responsibility even for the arse. Far from the glutinous gluteals being attached to him personally, the arse is a collective backside that is shared, like a Netflix subscription, or blame in a tragic personal injury case. Meanwhile, it’s a measure of the clue-free zone in which the stricken country now finds itself that eve of polling saw chatter that Johnson could be contemplating a snap election. That would bring us up to four general elections in a period of seven years, at which point the idea that we aren’t having some kind of constitutional nervous breakdown would feel slightly harder to sustain. Calling an election when you won an 80-seat majority not much more than two years ago feels like the equivalent of having a baby to keep your marriage together. A baby with your wife, I mean, not some art consultant or heavily injuncted Jane Doe. Then again, it’s said that some in the cabinet don’t even want part of their majority any more. On Thursday, it was reported that attorney general and acclaimed quarterwit Suella Braverman recently told Johnson he should expel “disloyal” Conservative MPs. Maybe the strategy of relying on Tory members of parliament being exposed as sex cases feels like it’s running down the majority too slowly. Having said that, at the current rate it’s possible that all Suella needs is a little patience. But as the Bank of England forecasts double-digit inflation and that the UK could plunge into recession, there will be some old-fashioned/idealistic/desperate people wondering: where are the ideas? What on earth is the plan? The government’s entire policy programme currently amounts to a small timeshare hotel in Rwanda and George Eustice’s suggestion that people might want to give supermarket value ranges a go. It all feels like busywork, the appearance of action. Far from attempting to shape events, the government seems to wait for them to turn up – good or bad – and then react to them. They remind me a lot of a newsdesk – perhaps inevitably, considering the country took the bold decision to elect a newspaper journalist to run it. Hard to think of a worse-run business we could pick the next leader from. A football club, perhaps, or a care home chain. Speaking of torpedoed flagships, whatever happened to levelling up, the supposedly overarching policy of the current administration? It ended up being one day in February, when Michael Gove reannounced a number of existing things as though they were new. Come to that, whatever happened to Michael Gove? The secretary of state for levelling up would have more visibility in a witness protection programme. I own a wonderful book about fantastical buildings that never ended up being built. I’m thinking of reshelving it alongside the 2015, 2017 and 2019 Conservative party manifestos, which contain a vast number of policies that never made it past the blueprint stage. 2015 promised seven-day GP access, and devoted a mere seven words to £12bn of welfare cuts. Three times as many words were given to their policy on polar bears. 2017 promised something other than the entire body politic convulsing over nothing but Brexit for more than two years. 2019 – well, how’s that working out for ya? Only against these yardsticks could those snap election rumours make a lunatic sort of sense. In the real world, it’s just possible that the solution to a number of acute challenges might be more complex than repeatedly switching the UK off then on again.

5/6/2022,"Italian police are racing to identify the owner of a superyacht linked to Vladimir Putin amid concerns it may be about to flee a shipyard in Tuscany. The Scheherazade, said to be worth $700m (£528m), has been under investigation since March for potential links to sanctioned Russians, including the president. A spokesperson for the Italian Sea Group, a company that repairs and builds luxury yachts, said the vessel, which has been undergoing a refit at its shipyard in Marina di Carrara since September, was scheduled to set sail by the middle of June. However, there are concerns the Scheherazade may be preparing to leave the boatyard, after a New York Times report that it had been moved out of dry dock and into the water on Tuesday. The newspaper cited a crew member who said it could leave the port imminently. Marianna Ferrante, the company’s marketing director, said: “Maintenance work is progressing and there are no scheduled departures anytime soon.” The company originally said the €6m refit would be completed in early 2023. The yacht is said to be equipped with a spa, swimming pools, two helipads, a wood-burning fireplace and a pool table designed to tilt so as to reduce the impact of the waves. Finance police in Marina di Carrara boarded the Scheherazade in early March as EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs kicked in over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They seized ownership documents from the yacht’s British captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce. At the time, US officials said they were also investigating whether the yacht belonged to Putin. Activists working with the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny have also claimed Putin is the owner. The vessel has not been seized, and until its owner is identified and if necessary placed under sanctions, the ship is free to leave Marina di Carrara. A source at the finance police said the investigation was “very complex” owing to a web of company names that could be concealing the real owner. “As you can imagine, after all this time, it’s not been easy [to identify] an owner, because of all the companies in between,” the source said. “There is no more information we can give, and asking if it belongs to Putin is like a lottery.” The source would not confirm whether or not police were preparing to seize the vessel. An investigation by La Stampa newspaper in March linked the Scheherazade to Eduard Yurievich Khudainatov, the former president of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, via a shell company registered in the Marshall Islands. Khudainatov is not on the sanctions list.",News/World news,Fears superyacht linked to Putin may be about to flee Italian shipyard,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/fears-superyacht-linked-putin-may-flee-italian-shipyard-scheherazade
5/6/2022,"More than 300 people were evacuated from their homes and 49 hospitalized when a carbon dioxide pipeline run by an oil and gas company ruptured in a rural community in Mississippi. People were described as wandering around “like zombies” in the aftermath of the February 2020 incident. Less than a week later, Sharon Hewitt, a Louisiana state senator who has considered running for governor, filed a bill drafted by the operator of that pipeline, Denbury Resources, into her own state’s legislature. The law, passed in 2020, could make it more difficult for Louisiana landowners to dispute CO2 pipelines, which are used to transport carbon pollution captured from fossil fuel projects. The bill was introduced and signed into law the same year that Hewitt’s husband, Stan, earned up to $4,999 in royalties from Denbury, according to Hewitt’s 2020 financial disclosure statement. There have been other instances when Sharon Hewitt, who previously worked at Shell, has pushed for laws that would benefit her husband’s company, according to public records shared with Floodlight. Stan Hewitt has worked as an engineer for nearly a decade at LLOG Exploration. The firm is among more than 200 oil and gas companies that are embroiled in lawsuits brought by seven parishes, including New Orleans, over damage to Louisiana’s wetlands, which protect coastal communities from storms and store carbon – the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change. Hewitt sponsored two bills and one resolution aimed at negating the lawsuits brought by the coastal communities against oil and gas companies – including LLOG. In the past three years, she has introduced, co-sponsored and voted on at least four other pieces of legislation that would benefit the oil company her husband works for or his fossil fuel investments. Sharon Hewitt, her husband, Stan, and Denbury Resources, which is now called Denbury Inc, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “It’s so brazenly personal,” said Itai Vardi, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI), a watchdog group focused on revealing the influence of fossil fuel companies. “It seems like she’s just trying to fend off these lawsuits that are aimed at her husband’s and other companies’ bottom lines. It’s one level above your standard Louisiana legislator who might own stocks in Exxon.” There is a long history in the Louisiana state capitol of legislators passing laws that profit their respective industries, but public policy experts point to Hewitt’s record as evidence of the oil and gas industry’s outsized influence at the legislature, despite its diminishing role in the state’s economy. Louisiana is experiencing more intense storms, coastal flooding and tornadoes that strike at night because of climate change, and lawmakers like Hewitt are digging in to protect industry. While introducing the bill Denbury drafted, Senate Bill 353, Hewitt in a May 2020 legislative committee hearing described the measure as a “great example of collaboration between the department and the industry”. Public documents shared with Floodlight by EPI show that Hewitt worked closely with the oil and gas industry in multiple instances, including drafting legislation, writing testimony supporting it and sorting out legal problems. Hewitt was elected to the Louisiana state senate in 2015, after working for nearly 20 years as a mechanical engineer and oil and gas executive for Shell. In 2018, Hewitt was named National Legislator of the Year by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a corporate-supported conservative group known for pushing “model legislation” – covering everything from gun rights and immigration to energy industry regulation – in state legislatures. Critics say her financial ties and legislative actions are an example of how Louisiana lawmakers are deeply intertwined with the oil and gas industry and avoid corporate accountability which, in turn, makes the state more vulnerable to climate change-driven storms and flooding. “There is a point at which it goes beyond conflict of interest to the abdication of duty,” said Carroll Muffett, the president of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a non-profit focused on strengthening laws to protect the environment and human health. A profile of Sharon Hewitt on her website says she “consistently advocates for smaller government, less taxes, fewer frivolous lawsuits, and better jobs”. Hewitt’s original bill amending carbon capture regulations would have capped liability for corporations to 10 years after carbon capture projects ended, but that part of the proposal was nixed. What became law could scale back how much a landowner can weigh in on a planned carbon dioxide pipeline.Carbon capture has become the preferred climate solution for fossil fuel companies, many of which have lobbied for the technology at the state legislature and with its climate taskforce. At least nine projects have been announced in Louisiana that would involve building carbon capture technology on new or existing facilities. The technology allows fossil fuel firms to avoid strictly reducing their emissions and will require building out of thousands of miles of pipelines nationwide. Those involved in the technology are in a prime position to see investment from the federal government. President Joe Biden’s bipartisan Infrastructure Bill that passed in 2021 appropriates more than $12bn towards carbon capture and utilization projects. Those projects aim to pull carbon from the atmosphere or capture the heat-trapping emissions at the pollution source. The carbon is then condensed into a super-cold liquid, transported through pipelines and stored underground. More often it’s used to force more oil out of the ground – called enhanced oil recovery – resulting in increased oil production and continuing the dirty emissions cycle. Hewitt’s 2020 legislation essentially removed landowners in the path of carbon capture pipelines from the list of stakeholders to be considered. According to a trove of internal emails shared with Floodlight, one Louisiana department of natural resources staff member referred to the bill openly as “Denbury’s CCS bill”. “It’s unsurprising that a major CO2 pipeline operator would delete pipelines from the eminent domain processes,” Carroll Muffett of CIEL said. “What is regrettable is that anyone vested with the public trust would let them get away with it, particularly since Denbury was the pipeline operator behind the pipeline rupture in Mississippi.” The pipeline rupture in Yazoo county, Mississippi, sent 49 residents to the hospital, many of them disoriented and struggling to breathe. The gas displaced oxygen in the air, stalled people’s cars – which need oxygen to run – and made residents foam at the mouth. Environmental and community groups caution that carbon capture technology is not proven to work, will not address other forms of harmful air pollution and directs subsidies away from alternative renewable energy. The United Nations’ latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report does acknowledge that technology to pull carbon from the air or capture it from plants is needed, but it emphasizes that the bigger need is to stop producing and using fossil fuels, and that industry lobbying has stalled that progress.",News/Environment,Louisiana legislator pushes bills benefiting the oil and gas industry — and her husband,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/06/sharon-hewitt-louisiana-senator-oil-gas-industry
5/6/2022,"Having vowed to check out Donna and Rob Taylor’s new place the moment it opened, I got there eventually. The pair left the excellent, if somewhat outback gastropub The Compasses Inn in Crundale, Kent, at the end of last summer, promising they had bigger plans afoot. And here they are at Tallow: 26 covers and a 10-seat private dining room in Southborough, a leafy town in the civil parish of Tunbridge Wells, yet, I hasten to add, a whole 2.6 miles from the town’s main railway station. Do not, I beg you, say that Southborough is actually just Tunbridge Wells, or its residents will revolt. Well, they will after they’ve finished playing cricket on the common overlooked by the heroically pretty St Peter’s Church. Parking up on a Saturday lunchtime with the cricket in full swing is a bit like guest-starring in a Miss Marple mystery, perhaps even more so when you get to Tallow itself, a tall, narrow building painted a rather gothic dark grey. Just as it was at the Compasses, Tallow’s food is unquestionably good. More than that, it’s get-in-the-car-and-go good. It’s “How far is Southborough, anyway?” good. Rob Taylor’s cooking seems, on first glance at the menu, reassuringly straightforward – there’s a steak tartare starter and chocolate brownie on the pudding list – yet his work is much more surprising. Take one of the first offerings, a small, freshly baked wild garlic bread that was sticky, fragrant and vividly Kermit-coloured. There was no need for butter, because its innards were moist with some sort of buttery, salty, algae-like concoction. Such touches always show a restaurant that’s going the extra yard. In a similar vein, a pre-lunch snack of crisp lamb croquette with a neat, mint mayo topping was substantial yet delicate at the same time. Tallow’s kitchen is on the first floor, which must mean a heavy calf muscle workout for the serving staff every shift, up and down those stairs, but they do it with endless esprit. Donna and her staff have a bright style that leaves you unequivocal about the fact that they really care about that plate of barbecued loin of pork with confit belly and celeriac and horseradish puree, or that they have personally eaten everything on the menu and would quite happily eat it all again right now, if time and work commitments allowed. I can’t blame them, because there is always time for carbohydrates in the form of Tallow’s warm terrine of potato and Cashel blue: translucent layers of clearly deeply cherished spud mixed with pleasantly pungent blue-veined cheese from Tipperary. (Incidentally, we had Cashel blue delivered by the kilo during lockdown, until my heart valves begged Charles to stop, but I was still overjoyed to see it on a menu again.) Again, at face value, “potato and cheese terrine” doesn’t sound much to write home about, but this one is so much more than the sum of its parts. It was topped with a hedge of microherb salad so high that Donna quipped she’d been late for work because Rob had given her the chore of clipping it all from their home patch. Tallow’s steak tartare is likewise ludicrously pretty, dotted with rich confit egg yolk and the briefest suggestion of pickled shallot. My favourite course may well have been the hake starter, featuring plump, perfectly timed fried white fish in a heavenly puddle of elegant curry sauce, with three of the fattest, meatiest, shelled mussels drinking in the fragrant broth. This is my sort of fine dining: the highest-quality ingredients and intricate plating, but with the coy undertones of walking back tipsily from the chip shop. For main, we shared a roast thornback ray wing with a delightful green mess of broad beans and sea vegetables, and some smoked haddock bonbons. One day, I’ll write a thesis on the culinary differences between the croquette, the bonbon and the kushikatsu panko-crumbed skewer, but now is not the time. A tart of caramelised garlic and parsley with baby leeks and onion puree was beautifully constructed, but such a funky collaboration of flavours that it’s definitely not one for the allium-phobic. I sought refuge in a side of fresh Kentish asparagus – a huge whopping bundle of the stuff – that negated its one-of-your-five-a-day prowess with a thick dijon mayo and a scattering of crisp onions. As at The Compasses, the desserts at Tallow linger. Yes, there was a very good, light homemade shortbread with whipped vanilla cream cheese and fresh, sweet gariguette strawberries, but the rather dull-sounding “chocolate and hazelnut brownie” was nothing of the sort: instead, this was a plinth of rich chocolate-and-hazelnut mousse in a glistening pool of salted caramel and miso sauce – so much sauce, and so glossy, in fact, I could have styled my hair in the reflection. The whole assembly was topped with a perfect quenelle of coffee ice-cream, and followed by a wobble back to the car. Spring Saturday lunches don’t get much better than this.

5/6/2022,"Apithy examination of marriage and mental illness shortlisted for this year’s Women’s prize for fiction, Sorrow and Bliss begins as its protagonist Martha splits up with her forbearing husband, Patrick, and moves back into her parents’ house. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that Martha has a mental health condition. When she was 17, on the morning of her French A-level exam, “a little bomb” went off in her brain, prompting her to go home and crawl under her father’s desk. Over the next 20 years, in order to deal with the chaos in her head, she continues to seek out confined, dark spaces where she lies “like a small animal that instinctively knows it’s dying”. The actor Emilia Fox reads Mason’s darkly funny novel, capturing Martha’s fury and confusion as well as her acerbic wit (the comparisons to Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag are not wide of the mark). Woven into her story is her maladjusted family, who include her father, Fergus, a poet whose career stalled shortly after he was designated “a male Sylvia Plath”; her mother, Celia, an alcoholic sculptor who is charismatic yet cruel; and sister Ingrid, who is both protective of and exasperated by Martha. And, of course, there’s Patrick, a sweet-natured doctor whom Martha has known since her cousin brought him home from boarding school one Christmas after his father forgot to send him a plane ticket home. Martha, who has precious little love for herself, knows that Patrick is too good for her. But the question remains: will he give her a second chance?

5/6/2022,"Peter Morgan, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter and creator of Netflix’s The Crown, is to explore the world of Russian oligarchs in a new play at the Almeida theatre in London. Patriots will star Tom Hollander as the businessman Boris Berezovsky, who was found dead, apparently hanged, at his Berkshire home in 2013. The play, set in Russia and the UK, features Vladimir Putin, whom the “kingmaker” Berezovsky helped into the Kremlin before the pair became foes. Berezovsky, who once owned Russia’s most powerful television station, fled to Britain, where he remained a prominent critic of Putin. The play’s story also involves Marina Litvinenko, widow of Berezovsky’s friend Alexander Litvinenko, the former spy who was murdered by radiation poisoning in London in 2006. There is a role, too, for Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea FC owner who is among the oligarchs to have had assets frozen in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich and Berezovsky were friends who ended up in London’s high court in 2012 for one of the biggest ever private litigation battles; Berezovsky claimed his ex-oil firm partner cheated him out of $5bn, but lost the case and was called an unreliable witness. Patriots is Morgan’s first play since The Audience (2013), which starred Helen Mirren as the Queen and inspired the writer’s blockbuster Netflix series The Crown, whose new series is set to be released later this year. Rupert Goold, the Almeida’s artistic director, will direct Patriots, which opens in July and is billed as “an unflinching story of ambition and the dangers of loyalty and love” at the dawning of a new Russia where “today’s patriot can fast become tomorrow’s traitor”. Will Keen has been cast as Putin, Yolanda Kettle will play Marina Litvinenko and Luke Thallon plays Abramovich. Further casting is to be announced. In an interview with Deadline, Goold said that the play will explore “the complicity and blindness of the west.” The production had been planned before the invasion of Ukraine in February, but then “took on a whole different filter” Goold added. Patriots was announced on Friday alongside another world premiere at the Almeida, The Clinic by Dipo Baruwa-Etti, whom Goold called “one of the country’s most exciting emerging talents”. Directed by Monique Touko, it is described as a political portrait of a woman “with a hunger for change”, and explores “how to rise from the ashes of a broken world”.

5/6/2022,"Icould not imagine that London might inflict any more visual damage to the Thames than it has already done. No city on earth has made such a mess of its river. But one of its biggest and most aggressive office blocks has just been approved on the South Bank in the heart of the capital. The slab – or rather tower and slab – that was approved by Lambeth council in March is to loom over the National Theatre opposite Somerset House. Its bulk will dominate every river view. The slab replaces the old ITV headquarters and is a behemoth in comparison. It will be more than twice the height of the neighbouring National Theatre. On the horizon it will be more prominent than St Paul’s or the Houses of Parliament. It is massive. The erection of such a building is patently an issue of civic if not national importance. It is inconceivable that central Paris or Rome would tolerate such an intrusion. Yet it has been approved on the say-so of just six members of Lambeth’s planning committee. They guiltily admitted it was likely to be “controversial and extremely unpopular” but justified it as “creating over 4,000 jobs”. There is no evidence of a job shortage in London just now, quite the opposite. The decision – and the absurdity of the reason – illustrates the collapse of serious town planning in the capital since Boris Johnson became mayor in 2008. Lambeth’s residents appear furious, their 260 objectors including councillors and the local MP, Florence Eshalomi. One councillor who voted for the slab agreed it was a “Marmite” block, but said it was justified as the developers, Mitsubishi Estate London and CO-RE, had promised that 1,000 jobs would be for “local residents”. These totally unenforceable pledges are like fluff in speculative developments, a sop to gullible councillors. That the block is also in a conservation area is merely an added insult to the concept of planning permission. Anyone who takes a new Thames Clipper downriver from Chelsea to Canary Wharf will see what the past 15 years have done to the metropolis. The shore is randomly lined with slabs and towers. They display no plan or cluster, no respect for context or community, certainly no architectural quality. Developers and their pet planners wave aside a concern for beauty as “subjective”. London is at the mercy of such philosophy. As for their utility, the towers are overwhelmingly empty investments. At the Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall, at 184 of the 214 flats over 50 storeys, no one was registered to vote in 2016. The idea that these buildings answer London’s “housing crisis” is sick; most are international bank balances in the sky. Yet Johnson promoted what he called “inward investment” on a highly publicised trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia in 2014. A foreign developer told me that the glory of building in London was that to gain approval: “A few dinners usually does the trick.” In truth the procedure is insidious. Revenue-capped London councils are chronically short of cash. A developer can propose a monstrosity and the planners may demur. The developer then asks them to “advise” on what they may allow, for a “fee” to the council. The planners become effective sponsors of the project before a planning committee, the architect “having taken our reservations into account”. Money swirls round everyone, except conservationists. London has no over-arching plan or vision. Each project is judged alone, devoid of wider implications, as if each borough was isolated somewhere in the country. Labour Lambeth has come to treat its Thames bankside as fringe territory, a lucrative source of income. Its Vauxhall blocks merge with Wandsworth’s Nine Elms towers up to Battersea power station and its Malaysia Square hub, so named to attract depositors. This Hong Kong-style planning for London was the baby of Boris Johnson’s former close aide, Eddie (now Lord) Lister, a wealthy developer lobbyist and former leader of Wandsworth council. The gated estates and ghostly towers are known in planning circles as “destreeted”. They stand as a bleak memorial to Johnson’s London. Technically the Lambeth decision is subject to call-in by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, but he has never shown the slightest interest in London’s appearance. He has no strategy for tall buildings and declined to intervene in the destruction of conservation areas, as round Paddington station and Fleet Street. He has now moved his office to the Royal Docks, opposite an extravagant but vacant 35-acre Chinese development, lauded in 2013 by Johnson as “a beacon for eastern investors”. It is rather a bank vault. The nearest to hope on the South Bank lies with the levelling up, housing and communities minister, Michael Gove. He recently intervened to protect Oxford Street from Westminster’s philistine council. Why he should back 4,000 more jobs in central London at a time like this is a mystery. London suffers an acute labour shortage, not a surplus, while the central areas office blocks are standing half-empty. Seeking to attract more investment and employment south to the capital is surely the last thing this government is about. It would make public mockery of levelling up. A blistering attack on the Lambeth slab has come from the former National Gallery and Royal Academy director Charles Saumarez Smith. He has pointed out that the government has set up a Building Better, Building Beautiful commission in an attempt to “inject beauty” into planning decisions. Unless this was cynical headline-grabbing, it is hard to imagine a more glaring case for its attention. At least the slab’s architects do not beat about the bush. Their name is Make. One wonders why they dropped the word Money.

5/6/2022,"Hi, Guide readers! I’m Keza, the Guardian’s friendly local video games editor (and writer of our games newsletter Pushing Buttons), taking over this week’s Guide to fill you in on what’s worth playing while you wait for the next episode of Better Call Saul to drop. Whether you’re in the mood for a vibey skateboarding game, pretend badminton or a grand fantasy epic, 2022 has been very kind to us so far. (And if you’re someone who thinks that video games aren’t for you then hey, stay with me. You never know, I might be able to persuade you otherwise.) First up, a game that seems directly aimed at everyone who’s ever taken a look at a Mondrian painting and said “But anyone could have done that”: Please, Touch The Artwork (PC, smartphones) is a puzzle game about abstract art, telling the genre’s origin story by letting you mess around with iconic paintings, trying to recreate their lines and colours. It makes you think about the art, how it’s constructed and what it means, and it’s also chill and unpressured, with no time limits or objectives to hurry you through. I’ve spent a couple of pleasant hours now poking at it on my phone when I don’t have the mental energy for anything more taxing (which, given the current state of the world, it quite a lot of the time. Another laid-back option is OlliOlli World, a welcoming skateboarding game that pairs a 90s counterculture vibe with a very 2022 street-art-and-chillhop soundtrack. I enjoy dressing up my little cartoon skater almost as much as tricking through the surreal skatescapes, wall-riding on billboards held up by giant bees. This becomes quite a hard game after a few hours, but never one that makes you want to throw your controller through the TV. Like in all good skating games, you can wring as many tricks and points out of each level as you can, or you can just focus on riding around, grinding and jumping and enjoying the sense of freedom. For anyone seeking something a little slower-paced, and more cerebral, this week’s new release Citizen Sleeper is essentially an interactive-novel-slash-board-game about a malfunctioning android that’s run away from its owners and is now trying to survive undiscovered on a dilapidated space station. Premise-wise it’s very Blade Runner, but involves much less action and much more thinking about the qualities of humanity and the evils of corporate capitalism, as it gets your brain’s cogs turning with its evocative text descriptions and sparse but beautiful illustrations. Tunic is another game whose gorgeous artwork is a large part of its appeal; it’s minimalist and lovely, a game about a little fox with a sword trying to solve a grand mystery as he explores an enigmatic island. If you ever played any of the older Zelda games in the 90s, it’s very similar – indeed, the whole game is kind of a tribute to the sense of mystery and adventure that Zelda and its ilk used to evoke in the days before Google and online walkthroughs. It has a manual written in runic script that you have to pore over and decode for clues about what to do next, worn and written-on like a beloved old comic. If you have 50+ hours to spare and a tolerance for steep challenge, there’s one game that’s dominated the conversation since it was released in February: fantasy epic Elden Ring, made by the Japanese developers behind the infamously intransigent and intellectually satisfying Dark Souls games. The fuss isn’t unjustified: this is one of the best games ever made, but you do need a lot of time and mental space for it to occupy. Imagine you’re exploring a medieval fantasy world, but basically everything from the dragons to the local wildlife is trying to kill you, and you’ve got some idea of what it entails. It’s an incredible world to get lost in. And lastly: if you’ve got a Nintendo Switch, get Nintendo Switch Sports. Remember waving a controller around to play tennis or bowling on the Wii? It’s that, but now there’s also badminton, sword-fighting, football and volleyball. Kids love it. Adults might initially be reluctant to get up and move around, but the second they hear the thwack of a pretend tennis ball, they’ll get into it too. It’ll be a winner at family gatherings all year. I hope you’ve found something you like the sound of. As mentioned, I write a whole other newsletter every week that’s all about the wild world(s) of video games – you can sign up here.

5/6/2022,"I started the bank holiday in traditional fashion, arguing with my 14-year-old son. This is why bank holidays exist, by the way, to remind you why secondary school exists, which is to let someone else irritate the hell out of your kids for six hours so you can go about your regular business of not irritating anyone that much. Sometimes these rows work out pretty well for me. Well, once: I said hurricanes were named alphabetically. With elaborate scorn that is still, 10 weeks later, delicious to me, he paced out all the letters between “D” and “U” before I casually mentioned that Eunice begins with E. Anyway, he claimed May Day was a religious ceremony, and I said it was actually International Workers’ Day, and we were both wrong – major religions hate equinoxes and ribbons, and anything else that might turn into an orgy, yet the celebrations commenced some centuries before organised labour – but I didn’t let that swerve me from my quest, which is to reminisce him into submission. We used to spend the day protesting, me and his auntie, I said, and he said “protesting what”, like nothing politically bad ever happened in the olden days, and OK, fine, he has a point. This was the early 2000s, when zero-hours contracts didn’t exist, and the minimum wage had just been brought in, and I think most likely we were fighting globalisation and the IMF, though what I chiefly remember was that we saw the actor Anna Carteret on the way up to the Trafalgar Square, and were amazed, because you really wouldn’t think of Juliet Bravo as a debt-jubilee kind of person. It was either that year or the one after that the police started kettling people, and my sister escaped after no more than 15 minutes by pretending to have a kidney infection, but I still managed to spin this to my kid as both of us having been arrested fighting The Man. He’d only been half-listening from the start, and by this point, I had no more than a third of his attention. But that’s part of my plan. One day, I will have poured so much anecdotage into him, extraneous information and exaggeration commingled, he will be unable to differentiate between me and Rosa Luxemburg. Pictures dropped of the Met Gala, the ultimate postmodern event: layer after layer of people arriving, then arriving further in, but do they ever truly arrive? Or is it like the layers of an onion, and at the dead centre, more onion? Guests were judged on two criteria: did they or did they not slay, which means “look good” in TikTok. And did they understand the assignment, which was “gilded glamour”? It’s much more complicated than it sounds, and you can’t just Google it to find out what Vogue says (though if you were to, you’d think New York between 1870 and 1890; you’d think embellishment and high structure; or you’d think Rockefeller and Vanderbilt and just apply a very thin moustache). Beneath the literal, lies a silent, much more stressful brief, which is to eclipse everyone else who knows how to use Google. Last year, all eyes were on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had “tax the rich” splashed across her great meringue-y, wedding-esque dress. It was such a magnificent provocation. Half the nation exploded in “how much was a ticket to the gala, huh? HUH?”, and “if she’s so radical, how come she can afford clothes?” The grumble of indignant heartburn could be heard across the world. So that was a hard act to follow, and nobody this year came close. Cara Delevingne sprayed herself gold, Kim Kardashian starved herself for weeks in order to look nothing like Marilyn Monroe, and Naomi Campbell bejewelled her face, but none took the crown. And so the theme of the night was properly observed, perhaps for the first time in the gala’s nearly 75 year history: “the gilded age” was coined by Mark Twain, of course, in a novel depicting a riven society held together by a superficial layer of economic growth. To render it in fancy dress is too big a job for one person, and has to be a collective effort: there’s no “me” in satire. The full human ramifications of the leaked supreme court decision to overturn Roe v Wade and criminalise abortion for American women will take months and years to unfold. But the impact was felt immediately, across the world, as issues that were previously a matter of settled humanity were suddenly up for grabs. A presenter on the Today programme wondered whether women really needed abortions, when adoption exists; the Times newspaper decided this judgment was good, actually, because it really showed up the downside of a written constitution, whose ultimate impact was to put the lives of millions in the hands of nine unelected and now predominantly Christian fundamentalist judges. I heard people arguing for reproductive autonomy on the basis that having an abortion is a decision nobody takes lightly, as if the past 60 years – over which we established quite painstakingly that it’s nobody else’s business whether you’re doing it lightly or not – had never happened. I heard too many people to count describe it as a “women’s issue”, as if unwanted pregnancies were a niche concern, like nail varnish, that men can simply skate above. I read people arguing that this was all the fault of trans activists, for reasons that slid from one bad faith proposition to another. It’s been like a discursive oil spill, clarity obscured, everything polluted at a stroke. The situation is serious indeed for US citizens, who have a fight on their hands. But the contest is quite different in the UK, where the number of people who oppose reproductive rights is vanishingly small and has been for years. Apart from the obvious task of international solidarity, our critical job now is to remember that a few fanatics, toying with people’s lives for cheap rhetorical advantage, should not be allowed to set the nation’s temperature. It was polling day, and therefore it was dogs-outside-polling-stations day. I’ve left a dog outside every polling booth I’ve ever been in, even when I had to borrow one. I’ve left young dogs and old dogs, other people’s dogs, dogs that could safely be left sitting, calmly, without a lead, and dogs that could happily be tied to other dogs, but since 2017, I’ve had the worst dog in the world, and it’s a completely different proposition. He is a bolter, an enthusiast for people, especially children, adults and anyone in hi-vis, and an inveterate hater of all other dogs, especially large ones but also many small ones. In 2017, incompetent tethering meant he got into the primary school, I guess expecting to find children in there. It turned out not everybody liked dogs. Oh, the chaos. If I’d been actively trying to suppress votes, I couldn’t have done better. In 2019, he took agin a labrador tied up opposite and, when I emerged from my doomed vote casting, was yowlling an aria of hatred that was like a metaphor for our busted politics. This year, my Mr and I now wise to the dog’s antics, we voted in relay, one waiting outside at all times to make sure he didn’t throw the election. By the end of the week, TalkTV, the scourge of the woke liberal left, had hit rock bottom, with Piers Morgan having lost 80% of his audience, and political editor Tom Newton Dunn having aired a show on Tuesday that registered precisely no viewers. As Shakespeare said, “the worst is not/ so long as we can say this is the worst”, which I think for simplicity’s sake can be paraphrased: you haven’t hit rock bottom while Piers is still talking. Nobody could accuse Morgan of having failed to prepare: he’d spent the weeks ahead giving interviews about wokery, tweeting about woke waffle, generally allowing the woke to live so rent-free in his head, while spinning so much attention out of us, that I wonder whether there’s a way for us to actually start charging him rent. He covered wokeness in the RAF and brought in the actor Brian Cox, another scourge of wokery, to bemoan the woke. So many of the complaints are opaque: they’re very noisy, for people who claim to have been silenced; and so extremely visible, for people who’ve been cancelled. But scourges gonna be scourging, I suppose. Yet this stubborn philosophical problem remains: if Piers really is giving voice to the voiceless, why aren’t they watching?

The pairing of apricots and almonds is delicate and beautiful, while the thyme in the syrup is gentle enough not to overpower the dish, but just enough to get you smiling. Make this for friends who want a lighter end to dinner. It’s really important to taste the apricots before you poach them, and again afterwards: fruit varies in sweetness and flavour, so adjust the sugar levels in the syrup accordingly.

Add the thyme and halved apricots, and simmer on a low heat for 15-20 minutes, until the fruit softens and the skins start to come away from the flesh. Turn off the heat, leave the fruit to sit in the hot liquid for five minutes, then gently lift out the apricots and pull off the skins. Return the fruit to the liquid, remove and discard the thyme stalks and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the almond cream. Toast the almonds in a dry pan until golden, then add the milk, sugar and double cream. When it starts to simmer, take off the heat and leave to infuse for an hour. Strain the milk mix through a sieve, and put the drained flaked almonds to one side. Soak the gelatine in ice-cold water until softened. Gently warm the milk mixture until steaming, then squeeze out the excess water from the gelatine, add the soft leaves to the hot milk and whisk to dissolve. Divide the milk mixture equally between four ramekins or dariole moulds, leave to cool slightly, then refrigerate for two to four hours, until completely chilled. Meanwhile, make the almond topping. Heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/325F/gas 3. Put the reserved drained flaked almonds in a bowl with the icing sugar and toss to coat. Spread the nuts on a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper and bake, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, until golden. Remove and leave to cool, then roughly crush.

5/6/2022,"Raj Singh Chaudhary is the Indian actor, screenwriter and now director who has developed his career under the mentorship of Anurag Kashyap, the creator of the mob classic Gangs of Wasseypur. Chaudhary has now made a punchy, nihilistic, western-style thriller, co-written with Kashyap, with hints of Sergio Leone and the borderland paranoia of Cormac McCarthy. The setting is Rajasthan in the 1980s, but not the Rajasthan beloved of tourists and attenders of the Jaipur literature festival: this is the vast, forbidding and starkly beautiful Thar desert between India and Pakistan. Movie legend Anil Kapoor turns in a likable, authoritative performance as a veteran police inspector called Singh whose beat covers the remote village of Munabao. As he nears retirement, Singh has to deal with a sudden incursion of banditry and violence from drug runners bringing opium across the border from Pakistan, but also strange and macabre acts of violence that don’t have any obvious motivation. Moreover, Singh and his deputy (a nice comic turn from Satish Kaushik) are nettled by the sudden appearance of a mysterious stranger, who calls himself Siddharth, played by Harshvardhan Kapoor, son of Anil. Apparently, Siddharth is a dealer in antiquities; however, Singh suspects that he is one of the drug runners, concealing narcotics in these fake and supposedly priceless objects. Yet the truth is stranger still, and involves Siddharth’s relationship with a lonely and beautiful woman, played by Fatima Sana Shaikh. This is a stomach-turningly violent movie, and Inspector Singh isn’t above using beatings to get answers to his questions. There is a very impressive action sequence involving a Land Rover flying through the air. In the end, I felt the explanation for the violence was a little glib, but this is a film made with gusto and style.

5/6/2022,"The elephant in the room is a trinket. It is an animal ornament that catches the light with its silvery spangles. These days, it embarrasses its owner, Ella – not so much because it smacks of cultural appropriation, she being a white actor from Hebden Bridge, the elephant a symbol of the Hindu deity Ganesh. It is more because it reminds her of her 10-year-old self, a little girl entranced by the fabrics and colours of India. Played by a spirited Eva Scott, she whisks the elephant out of the way of her new boyfriend Haseeb, a north London poet. He jokingly reminds her his family is not from India – his parents were born in Pakistan – but the ornament is a small reminder of their differing cultural backgrounds. In Zia Ahmed’s romantic two-hander, previously staged at London’s Bush theatre, this literal elephant in the room becomes metaphorical. They even give it a name – André – as it expands into the space between them. Usman Nawaz, low-key and conversational as Haseeb, can’t help but project the microaggressions of a racist society on to their relationship. In turn, Ella can only feel pushed away. However hard the two try to accept each other as they are, cultural baggage weighs them down. Sometimes it is of no consequence: the perceived differences between north and south London or the familiar way people greet each other in the countryside. But where on a sliding scale of discomfort do you put cultural stereotyping or the possibility of a racist attack? Neither of them are complicit in these things – on the contrary, they actively call them out – but as they go from Christmas to Eid to Halloween, André increases in size. It is a Romeo-and-Juliet tragedy in which the lovers have internalised the Montague/Capulet schisms. Or at least, it would be if the drama were not played out on so modest a scale. Director Sameena Hussain draws attractive performances from Scott and Nawaz, even if they don’t quite win your heart. On a set by Warda Abbasi that deftly suggests railway arches, tube trains and bedrooms, theirs is a relationship without urgency. Ahmed has much to say about the insidious effects of a divided culture – but his narrative meanders where it should sting.
