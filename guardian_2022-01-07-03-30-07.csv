1/7/2022,"One in five parents give their children pocket money by bank transfer, a survey has found, with youngsters in the UK set for a pay rise from their families this year. Children’s average weekly “salaries” are to increase from £6.97 to £7.58, which is almost twice the rate of inflation, according to a poll by Barclays that surveyed parents of children aged under 16.  While the majority of parents are sticking to giving out cash, typically in exchange for help around the home, more than one in five (22%) opt for bank transfer. Household chores including washing the car, looking after younger siblings and cleaning the bathroom tend to reap the highest rewards, the survey showed. When it comes to breaking into the piggy bank, sweets and chocolate are the most popular way for children to spend their earnings. More than two-fifths (44%) of children decide to hold on to the cash and put it towards something else – a budgeting decision that seems to impress their parents, with more than half of respondents (53%) believing their child is good at managing their money. Children’s early experiences with handling money can shape their financial behaviour as adults, according to a study published by the UK government’s MoneyHelper service. By the age of seven, the University of Cambridge research found, most children understand the value of money, delaying gratification and the idea that poor choices now can affect their future. Gillean Dooney, head of families at Barclays, said: “If your kids are happy to do their bit around the house, pocket money is a really good way of teaching them the value of money at an early age.” Barclays’ research found many parents start giving their child a small amount when they turn seven. “Many of the parents we surveyed said that this was one of the biggest motivators behind giving pocket money to their children,” she added. Dooney recommended creating a visual savings plan with key milestones that children could track and tick off along the way. Other banks have also rolled out services in recent months to encourage families to talk about finances early. In October, NatWest acquired the London-based children’s pocket money app RoosterMoney, which is designed to get parents and children to practise budgeting skills together. The app currently has 130,000 UK users, and has added features like reward charts, chore reminders, and customised interest rates that can be set by parents to encourage the saving habit.",Lifestyle/Money,UK children to get inflation-busting rise in pocket money,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/children-pocket-money-uk-average-bank-transfer
1/7/2022,"The acting boss of the Gambling Commission is to be given the job on a permanent basis, the Guardian understands, signalling government approval for his vow to crack down on gambling companies’ “recidivist behaviours” before a landmark industry review. Andrew Rhodes became acting chief executive of the regulator in June 2021, after the sudden resignation of Neil McArthur.  Rhodes has since hinted at plans to take a sterner approach, in line with expected reforms of gambling legislation, due to be unveiled in a government white paper early this year. During a speech last month, Rhodes said the commission would take a hard line with companies that transgressed the conditions of their licence more than once, promising to crack down on “recidivist behaviours towards compliance”. He also said that the industry had “overstated” its repeated warnings that punters would be driven towards the black market if regulatory reforms were too draconian. “We are not going to be deflected away from that mission, in some sort of race to the bottom because someone else is worse,” said Rhodes. “That’s the whole point of having a regulated market.” The Guardian understands that Rhodes’ tone has been well received within the Gambling Commission and in government, with the culture minister, Nadine Dorries, expected to confirm his permanent appointment imminently, on a salary of £150,000. Rhodes will oversee two of the most important moments in the Gambling Commission’s history, the government gambling review and the fiercely-fought competition for the fourth national lottery licence. Rhodes is a former director of operations at the Department for Work and Pensions and also served as chief operating officer of the Food Standards Agency. He was also chief operating officer of Swansea University, his alma mater, and chair of the community trust at Swansea City football club. In 2020, Swansea City became the highest-profile club in the UK to drop a betting company as its sponsor, amid a broader campaign to disentangle gambling from football.

1/7/2022,"Peter Bogdanovich, Oscar-nominated writer and director, has died at the age of 82. The film-maker, whose many credits included The Last Picture Show, What’s Up Doc? and Paper Moon, died of natural causes according to his daughter Antonia Bogdanovich.  Bogdanovich started his career as both a film programmer and a critic, writing articles for Esquire. After moving to Los Angeles and striking up a friendship with director Roger Corman, he secured his first directing gigs, making the sci-fi picture Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women, which he chose to have his name removed from, and in 1968 Targets, a breakout crime thriller. In this time he also became close friends with Orson Welles. His next film was 1971’s The Last Picture Show, starring Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd and Cloris Leachman, a rapturously received drama that earned eight Oscar nominations and won two awards. It was also a surprise commercial hit, making $29m from a $1.3m budget. Upon its 50th anniversary, the Guardian’s Scott Tobias referred to it as an “elegiac masterpiece”. “I was moved by the reviews,” he said to the New York Times in 1971. “The picture seems to have brought a melancholy poetry out of the critics by which I feel quite flattered. All the reviews were strangely personal. I suspect most of the critics are of an age to have grown up at the time of the movie.” His next film was screwball comedy What’s Up Doc? starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal, a hit that became the highest-grossing film of 1972. It was later included on the American Film Institute’s list of the 100 greatest comedies of all time. The 70s also saw him reunite with O’Neal for Paper Moon, a comedy that saw the actor’s daughter Tatum O’Neal win an Oscar for best supporting actress. He turned down The Godfather, The Exorcist and Chinatown. “I was hot,” he admitted to Vulture in 2019. His later films included Mask, starring Cher, and The Cat’s Meow, starring Kirsten Dunst. He also had a recurring acting role in The Sopranos and had a small role in both Kill Bill films after living in Quentin Tarantino’s guesthouse for a year. In 2010, he joined the University of North Carolina School of the arts as part of the directing faculty and in 2014 made his last narrative film, the comedy She’s Funny That Way starring Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson. In 2018, he released his final film, the Buster Keaton documentary The Great Buster: A Celebration. Tributes have started to emerge from the industry. Francis Ford Coppola released a statement to Deadline to say he was “devastated” at the news. “He was a wonderful and great artist,” he wrote. “I’ll never forgot attending a premiere for The Last Picture Show. I remember at its end, the audience leaped up all around me bursting into applause lasting easily 15 minutes. I’ll never forget although I felt I had never myself experienced a reaction like that, that Peter and his film deserved it. May he sleep in bliss for eternity, enjoying the thrill of our applause forever.” Guillermo del Toro also tweeted: “He was a dear friend and a champion of Cinema. He birthed masterpieces as a director and was a most genial human. He single-handedly interviewed and enshrined the lives and work of more classic filmmakers than almost anyone else in his generation.” Bogdanovich is survived by his two children Antonia and Sashy.",Arts/Film,"Peter Bogdanovich, acclaimed writer-director, dies at 82",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/peter-bogdanovich-dies-acclaimed-writer-director
1/7/2022,"As one of the most extraordinary days in the history of professional tennis finally came to an end, uncertainty still reigned. Novak Djokovic had started Thursday at the beginning of what would become about 10 hours of waiting and questioning at passport control in Tullamarine airport in Melbourne, before his visa was cancelled and deportation loomed. He ended the day alone in an immigration hotel in Carlton. According to reports from Serbia, Djokovic’s futile hopes of leaving the hotel to join his team were quashed, his only company the insects and the bugs beside him in his room. Outside, fans gathered to brandish their Serbian flags and sing Balkan folk songs into the night.  It is still unclear where Djokovic goes from here. He has appealed against the federal government’s ruling on his visa and he will remain in Melbourne until Monday at least, the day of his hearing, with the hope of putting this case behind him. But even if he is able to overturn the ruling and compete for his 10th Australian Open title, this has been an unwanted, emotionally draining episode that has helped nobody and has reflected terribly on all involved. On the court, Djokovic continues to pull off magical feats. Last season, every single grand slam tournament seemed to yield a new all-time record, from clinching the record number of weeks at No 1 to the astounding feat of securing every single grand slam tournament and Masters 1000 event at least twice. He is the men’s player of the decade by a mile. Yet his breathless ability on the court is paired with his frequent tendency to self-sabotage. It is often said about the best players that their greatest opponents are themselves but Djokovic takes it to new levels. He chases history and a record-setting 21 grand slam titles, yet he is so taken by alternative science that he was willing to complicate his chances by arriving unvaccinated at one of the world’s strictest borders. It is hubris and it is the single-minded self-belief that drives his tennis but also so often leads him astray. The decisions he makes reflect the necessity of having the right people around with wise counsel. It is particularly notable that while Djokovic remained stuck at the border, members of his team strolled into Melbourne. The absurdity of this whole affair was dissected by, of all people, Rafael Nadal. “I think if he wanted, he would be playing here in Australia without a problem,” he said, shrugging. It seems unlikely that Djokovic will look at this episode as an opportunity to grow. More often than not, the injustices that Djokovic perceives to have suffered tend to have the opposite effect, only furthering his resolve and reaffirming the belief that he is one man up against the world. No matter how this plays out, this incident is merely setting the tone for the seasons to come. On the same day that Djokovic was flying towards his fate in Melbourne, Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, was controversially revealing his plan to “piss off” unvaccinated citizens. The French Open is, incidentally, the next grand slam and it is likely that more vaccine mandates are to come for the travelling group of tennis players, with more decisions for Djokovic and others to make. While Djokovic continues to receive scorn, all entities involved are deserving of criticism. Over the past few years it has become standard to see Craig Tiley, Tennis Australia’s chief executive, appear on TV to smooth over controversy and promote the top players. Indeed, as Djokovic was flying into Melbourne Tiley was front and centre as he reassured the public of the robustness of the medical panels that decided who received exemptions. Since the cancellation of Djokovic’s visa, he has been conspicuous in his absence from the airwaves. Tiley’s silence reflects the undeniable failures of Tennis Australia and the Victorian government, those medical exemptions allowing Djokovic to enter the tournament but having no effect on federal border policy once he arrived there. Tiley revealed that of 26 applicants only a “handful” of exemptions were granted, some of which are now reportedly being examined more closely. The failures of Tennis Australia and Victoria government do not absolve the federal government and the bickering between state and federal entities that has defined this situation. One day before Djokovic arrived in Australia, the country’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked in a press conference about Djokovic’s imminent arrival; he described it as an issue for Victoria state. A day later he swiftly changed his tune. It could be concluded that it wasn’t until then that he realised the political points to be scored from being seen to act harshly. Shortly after Djokovic’s visa had been cancelled, Morrison cynically moved to take credit for the decision, resorting to harmful populist rhetoric regarding his border controls. “Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders,” he said. “No one is above these rules.” Ironically, though, one positive aspect of this incident is the increased attention on just how cruel Morrison’s border policies are. Even if he is banished from the country, Djokovic will be fine. He has the resources and profile to seek out representatives when most would have been sent on the first flight back home. There are 36 refugees at Djokovic’s Park hotel. Some have been stuck in the hotel for eight years, victims of those very same border controls Morrison boasted about and treated abhorrently by the state ever since. They deserve the attention and compassion that politicians like Morrison lack.",Sport/Sport,"Self-sabotaging Novak Djokovic deserves criticism, but so do others in this sorry saga | Tumaini Carayol",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/self-sabotaging-novak-djokovic-deserves-criticism-but-so-do-others-australian-open-vaccine
1/7/2022,"Here, at last, was the Joe Biden that anyone on vigil for America’s teetering democracy had been waiting for. In historic National Statuary Hall at the US Capitol, a year to the day after it was overrun by an authoritarian mob, the US president gave his clearest dissection of “the big lie” and his clearest denunciation of his predecessor, Donald Trump.  It cannot have been easy for a man who spent 36 years in the Senate, sometimes reaching across the aisle to unsavoury characters, who speaks of bipartisanship with cloying nostalgia and who ran for the White House as an apostle of national unity.Biden could have used Thursday’s anniversary to offer olive branches, finding comfort in the traditional role as head of state as an excuse to rise above political battles of the day. His instinct may have been to be as apolitical and anodyne as a monarch. But this was the moment that the commander-in-chief realised the clear and present danger posed to American democracy by one of its major parties and former leader gone rogue. The alarmed voices of fellow Democrats, activists, journalists and historians about the state of emergency finally seemed to have got through to him. He understood that platitudes and prayers for a miraculous Kumbaya moment will no longer do. You cannot reason with extremists whose premise about a stolen election and the insurrection being the will of the people – wrapped up in the cult of Trump – is fundamentally irrational. You cannot debate Fox News or fascism-curious Facebook users. Instead, the threat must be looked squarely in the eye. “We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie,” Biden said, his voice at times trembling with anger. “Here’s the truth: a former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He’s done so because he values power over principle.” He never mentioned the name “Trump” but he did refer to the “former president” often. In a remark that would have stung at Mar-a-Lago, Biden said: “He’s not just a former president; he’s a defeated former president.” He also noted: “You can’t love your country only when you win.” In a 25-minute speech that sounded like campaign-trail Biden, he recalled how the Confederate flag, symbol of the pro-slavery south in the civil war, had been brandished in the halls of the Capitol for the first time a year ago. “We are in a battle for the soul of America,” he acknowledged. “I did not seek this fight, brought to this Capitol … But I will not shrink from it either. I will stand in this breach, I will defend this nation. I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of this democracy.” It was a bracing call to action from a president accused of spending too much of his first year in office cutting deals with Republicans, for example on new roads and bridges, rather than throwing himself into the arena in a bare-knuckle fight over voting rights. It was also clear evidence that Barack Obama’s celebrated 2004 convention speech – “There is not a liberal America and a conservative America – there is the United States of America” – no longer meets the moment. It would be as naive as claiming that America no longer sees race.But will it make a difference? Most Republicans, including leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, are not even in town. Rightwing media dismissed the speech as divisive. Trump was quick to issue a statement that said Biden “used my name today to try to further divide America. This political theater is all just a distraction from the fact Biden has completely and totally failed.” With divisions having only calcified since 6 January, that is likely to be the Republican message going forward. But now, at least, they know they have a fight on their hands. Biden is no longer standing by amid the slow-motion coup and white nationalist backlash now taking place. “The way you have to heal, you have to recognise the extent of the wound,” he told reporters at the Capitol just after his speech. “This is serious stuff … You’ve gotta face it. That’s what great nations do, they face the truth, deal with it, and move on.”",News/US news,No time for platitudes as Biden gives sharpest denunciation of Trump yet,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/biden-trump-january-6-capitol-attack-democracy-analysis
1/7/2022,"Massive coordinated sanctions threatened against Russia if it launches military action against Ukraine will hit the high-level Russian elite and its ability to carry out financial transactions, Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, told MPs on Thursday, as she warned the west could not afford to be seen to reward Moscow in crucial talks next week. Her remarks appear indirectly to confirm that if Russia mounts an incursion into Ukraine it could be excluded from Swift, the messaging network used by 11,000 banks in 200 countries to make cross-border payments.  The US and its Nato allies have said repeatedly it has a package of massive sanctions ready to be launched if Russia presses ahead with an invasion, but has refused to spell out details in public. Truss said: “The UK is working with our partners on these sanctions, including high-impact measures targeting the Russian financial sector and individuals.” She also disclosed she will travel to Ukraine next month. But her carefully acquired “Iron Lady” image was undermined as she repeatedly came under cross-party pressure about lax anti-money laundering laws in the UK, including the failure to establish a public register of beneficial ownership of property in the UK or in UK overseas territories. Chris Bryant, a Labour member of the foreign affairs select committee, said it was “inexplicable and entirely hypocritical” that the government was so slow to clean up the banking system. Kevan Jones, a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said only one recommendation of the committee’s landmark report concerning Russian influence in the UK had been implemented by the government, concerning a register of interests in the Lords. Truss said 25 Russian nationals have been subject to UK sanctions and the UK will continue to review this legislation. Liberal Democrat MPs called for a windfall tax on Gazprom, the hugely profitable Russia-based gas company which has its trading arm in the UK. Despite the divisions over London’s role in enabling the Russian elite, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the UK parliament was united in its condemnation of Russia’s intimidation of Ukraine. He said: “this is a moment of acute danger” and added Russia’s demands “are completely incompatible with the sovereignty of Nato allies and the independence of Ukraine”. Truss was making a Commons statement before a Nato foreign ministers’ meeting on Friday, a final conference among western nations before they hold a string of meetings with Russia next week, including a bilateral meeting between the US and Russia on future security relations on Monday. Truss said these meetings were “absolutely critical for peace and security in Europe”, adding they were in her view about insisting Russia abide by its past commitments concerning Ukraine’s sovereignty. Truss has been leading the calls in Europe to take a tough line with Russia, insisting it is vital that the west does not succumb to the false Russian narrative that Nato is an offensive alliance or a threat to Moscow. She argued it would be wrong to remove from Ukraine the right to join Nato, saying: “The UK remains supportive of Ukraine’s Nato membership aspirations in line with the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration.” She added: “There is no justification whatsoever for Russia’s bellicose stance towards Ukraine. It is unprovoked and it is part of a wider pattern of behaviour by the Kremlin, reliant on disinformation and mistrust to seek to gain an upper hand.” UK diplomats are still evaluating the significance for Ukraine of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, sending troops to quell protests in Kazakhstan, a move that leaves Russia exposed militarily on two fronts. She also urged Germany to end its strategic dependence on Russian gas, symbolised by the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, saying it was part of a wider problem of the west’s dependence on the resources of autocrats. In Washington the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he could not envisage gas ever flowing through Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine. He was speaking alongside the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, an opponent of the pipeline who has to navigate support for the project from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz.",News/World news,Liz Truss says Russia faces high-level sanctions if it invades Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/liz-truss-says-russia-faces-high-level-sanctions-if-it-invades-ukraine
1/7/2022,"John Vidal’s list (It’s the great green reset: 10 things Britain can do now to save the planet, 3 January) seems very achievable, but I would like to add one more to accelerate change: climate income. First, introduce a carbon tax across all industries to price emissions into the market, closing a huge economic loophole. By gradually increasing the tax, we not only incentivise lower emissions on the supply side, but we also drive demand for low-carbon alternatives.  Second, redistribute the revenue equally to all citizens. This protects the most vulnerable consumers, who already have smaller carbon footprints, from fuel poverty. The wealthiest people with the biggest carbon footprints would see their costs rise, but for the majority, costs would be neutral. Third, introduce carbon border adjustments. This policy would prevent emissions being transferred offshore, but also protect many UK businesses, especially our vibrant small business community, from competitors in countries without a carbon tax. This policy would help drive many of the others at a time when we need real urgency.Darrin CharlesworthCitizens’ Climate Lobby UK  There is one additional action that would make achieving John Vidal’s wishlist much easier: start a serious conversation about how we make money. Money is probably the most powerful tool ever invented by humans, but the way we account for its use is leading us to destruction. By steadfastly refusing to acknowledge the environmental cost of our activities and by treating the future as less valuable than today, we have built a complex economic system whose primary incentive is to destroy the living world. The old way of doing things may have been practical when the human population was small, but it is not appropriate for today’s population and level of technological development. Rather than continue to argue about how we should share money (fossil fuel companies or renewable energy, meat farmers or vegetable growers), a deep reset of what constitutes profit would give us the chance to overhaul the economy so that it rewards activities that nourish the future. Then, maybe humanity will have one.Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset  John Vidal fails to mention the one thing above all others that needs to be addressed if we are truly to save the planet, and that is the relentless rise in world population. As many academic papers demonstrate, in terms of the steps that an individual can take to limit their contribution to global heating, a voluntary limitation of family size is by far the most effective.Peter AlsburyLondon  I agree with everything John Vidal proposes, but know that not a single one of these things will happen with this government in power. At the beginning of the pandemic, I, like many others, thought it was time to rethink how we live and how our society could change its priorities. How wrong we were. At the age of 76, I will not be around to experience the worst of what is in store, but my grandchildren certainly will be.

1/7/2022,"Your editorial (31 December) refers to the imminent publication of the white paper on levelling up. It discusses the promotion of the mayoral model beyond city regions, and levelling up regions and areas that have been neglected for decades. The problem with this is that the UK does not have regional authorities to do the job. In their absence who is going to identify the key issues that need to be addressed and respond to them effectively? Who is going to quantify the resources needed and how to spend them? Whose business is it going to be to ensure enduring success?  One of the costs of Brexit has been the loss of EU regional funds. The EU gave these, over the heads of governments, directly to Europe’s regional authorities because otherwise they would just go into national treasuries. Regions need to be able to produce and cost their own plans for levelling up and negotiate these with the government, not the other way round. Look no further for exemplars of how UK local government needs to be reformed than the successful Scottish regional authorities that existed for 20 years before the advent of the Scottish parliament.Roger ReadFormer secretary general, Metrex, the network of European metropolitan regions and areas  Your editorial omits one key role of national government in relation to devolution – that of creating, as far as possible, a level playing field. For many years, when local authorities had the power to fix rates and to spend the money locally, there was a rate equalisation grant from central government, calculated on the local authority’s level of financial capacity. Now, with central government controlling tightly so much of what a council can raise and spend, there is very little municipal independence. This has led to cynical cuts in central funding of over 40%, with the blame for cuts in services falling mainly on poverty-stricken local councils. Devolution will potentially level up a divided country if, and only if, it is accompanied by devolved regional financial powers, with the national government’s sole role being to provide a grant to assist the poorer regions to level up to a national average of financial capacity.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This could have been aided by reference to the Australian philosopher Val Plumwood’s reflections on surviving a crocodile attack, The Eye of the Crocodile. After being rolled three times she was released from its jaws and, with appalling injuries, managed to escape.  Plumwood wrote that the encounter made her realise that “we, too, are food … as I looked into the eye of the crocodile, I realised my own vulnerability as an edible, animal being”. She argues that our dominant story, that humans are different from, and higher than, other creatures “has encouraged us to eliminate from our lives any animals that are disagreeable, inconvenient or dangerous”.

1/7/2022,"My uncle David Young, who has died aged 100, spent his entire working life with the Moral Re-Armament (MRA) movement (now Initiatives of Change), an organisation that aims to promote peace, reconciliation and integrity in public life. David joined MRA in 1950, and two years later was sent to India to help out with a lengthy touring stage show that promoted the values of MRA, turning his hand to anything and everything backstage as well as arranging accommodation for the performers and becoming involved in general administration.  As the tour drew to a close in late 1953, he volunteered to stay on in India in various roles, ushering in an itinerant life that later included work at the MRA’s European centre in Caux, Switzerland, its US base in Michigan, a six-month promotional tour of Canada, and further lengthy spells in India. David was born in Dundee to Charles Bowden Young, a lecturer in English at St Stephen’s College Delhi, in India, and Ruth, a doctor who later became principal of Lady Hardinge Medical College in Delhi. He was born in the UK when his mother came back for a short family visit, but grew up in India until the age of 10, when he was sent as a boarder to the Dragon school in Oxford and then Oundle school in Northamptonshire. Following an engineering apprenticeship in Manchester, David joined the Royal Engineers during the second world war, and thanks to his connections with India he served with the Bombay Sappers in Burma, where he was awarded the Military Cross for bravery after defusing an arsenal of explosives that the retreating Japanese had planted to block a tunnel in 1944. After the war he went to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and on completing an engineering degree he began working for MRA in 1950. He married Margot Meekings in 1958, and the two of them almost immediately set off for India together, settling in Pune, where they both worked for the MRA. By 1963 David and Margot were running summer camps for young Indians under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson Rajmohan Gandhi in a hill town south of Pune called Panchgani. This eventually led David to manage the construction of the MRA’s Asia Plateau training centre there, which opened in early 1968. Later, he and Margot went with the MRA to Chennai before moving back to the UK in the mid-1970s to be near David’s elderly mother. They eventually retired to Brighton, near where Margot had grown up. Even in retirement David remained committed to the MRA, and as late as 2017 he was organising inter-faith sessions in Brighton between Christians and Muslims.He returned to India aged 96 to attend the 50th anniversary of Asia Plateau in 2018; and again in 2020 for an anniversary celebration of the Bombay Sappers in Pune, where he was the oldest attendee.

1/7/2022,"Melody Beard will forever rue the moment she took her youngest daughter to use the toilet and missed the statue of slave-trader Edward Colston being thrown into Bristol’s harbour. The 40-year-old had, like many on that day, joined protests in the city’s centre, along with her husband and two children.  But at the moment on 7 June 2020 when the bronze statue was toppled, dragged to the harbourside and dumped in the grimy waters, she was away from the action, taking her daughter to the loo. On Thursday, the day after four anti-racism campaigners were cleared of criminal damage for their involvement in pulling down the statue and throwing it in the River Avon during a Black Lives Matter protest, Beard was glad to have witnessed most of the historic event. Beard, who has lived in the city for more than 10 years and runs a cafe in a community venue, said: “Obviously it was a situation of the moment – everyone was feeding off each other. “I don’t necessarily think we should just point to four people specifically, because there were many more people involved. “It started an international debate about why we put certain people on plinths, why are they important, why are they usually male and white, and not really relevant any more. “A lot of Bristolians, living in Bristol, feel very connected to the event. “My husband and I took our children, two little girls, and we missed the real action. We heard everyone cheering but because one of them needed to pee we had to go … we had to move on because she was desperate … so we were almost at that moment.” There was a supportive mood for the jury on a grey, drizzly Thursday in the city, a place known for its political activism, free spirit and creativity. Ashley, 28, who asked not to have his full name published as he works in the public sector, agreed with Beard’s view that there were many involved, not just the four standing trial. He said: “The powers that be had to pretty much appear to be doing something but the outcome was set in stone before it went to trial. Ultimately, it was the right thing for there to be an ‘all clear’ essentially. “For many, many years, people were advocating for something to be done [about the statue] and the powers that be didn’t do anything. “The fact people had to take it into their own hands was through [the authorities’] own making – to hold a few accountable for what was the actions of many would have been grossly wrong in my eyes and I think most agree with that.” Alagie Sowe, 33, said he did not think figures such as Colston should be celebrated with statues, but added: “It should be kept in a museum where people can see it and remember, so the history is there to be learned. If it was in a more appropriate place, people wouldn’t have felt they had to bring it down.” The statue was later taken out of the harbour and was put on display, on its side, in M Shed, the museum of Bristol, in an exhibition that ended on 3 January 2022. The statue is now in the museum’s adjoining L Shed, where it can be seen in pre-booked tours. But other citizens were less engaged. Otis McDonald, 35, who recently moved to Bristol from London, said: “To me, it wasn’t a very big deal. I get why they did it and I think it was the right thing to clear them. I didn’t follow the background. I was living in London at the time. “I didn’t follow it as closely as I should have done. Considering the current climate, the focus on the BLM movement, I can understand why they [reached the verdict].” Aisha Sheikh, 21, who was born in Kenya but moved to the UK when she was younger and has lived in the city for two years, said: “My dad always said to keep out of politics. I just live my life. “It’s not that I just keep out of it – if I had something to say about it I would, but I just don’t know that much about it. I saw the protests happening, but I’m just an observer.”",News/UK news,‘Bristolians feel very connected to the event’: local reaction to Colston verdict,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/bristol-reaction-colston-statue-verdict

1/7/2022,"My father, James Armour, known as Jimmy, who has died aged 92, was a veterinary scientist and teacher who specialised in the diagnosis and treatment of parasitic diseases in animals. He was involved in the development of the “wonder drug” Ivermectin, used to treat worms, lice and ticks in animals and to eradicate African River Blindness in people. Jimmy was born in Basra, Iraq, to James Armour, who worked in shipping, and his wife, Margaret (nee Roy). The family came home to Scotland in 1935, settling in Troon. James attended Marr college and studied at Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine, graduating in 1953. In the same year he went to Nigeria with the Colonial Vet Service, returning to the UK in 1960, joining Cooper Technical Bureau (later the Wellcome Trust).  In 1963 he returned to Glasgow vet school as a researcher, becoming a lecturer in 1967, reader in 1972 and professor of parasitology in 1976. He established multidisciplinary teams to develop new methods of diagnosis and treatment of parasitic diseases and gained international recognition for his work. One of the highlights of his research collaborations was the development of the anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin, with colleagues at Merck, Sharp and Dohme. Jimmy was a leading consultant to MSD’s veterinary division for the development of new drugs. Ivermectin was discovered in 1975 and marketed for veterinary use in 1981, to treat parasitic diseases such as gut worms, lice and ticks in animals. Later it was shown to be effective in humans for the eradication of African River Blindness. It was the first veterinary drug to achieve £1bn in annual sales. Jimmy was also a gifted teacher and published extensively. He co-authored a textbook on veterinary parasitology, first published by Blackwell in 1987, and lectured and examined at universities across the world. In 1986 he was elected dean of Glasgow vet school. In 1988 the Riley Review of veterinary education recommended the closure of the school and Jimmy led a highly organised campaign to challenge and rebut Riley’s assumptions. The recommendations of the Riley Report were overturned and this victory was followed by a period of considerable expansion at the school. In 1991, he was appointed vice-principal of Glasgow University. He also held many external appointments including chairing the UK Veterinary Products Committee (1987-1996) and the board of the Moredun Animal Research Institute (2000-2004). He was knighted in 1995 for his contribution to veterinary science and veterinary education and retired the same year. Jimmy was also an outstanding golfer. In 1947 he won the British boys’ championship at Hoylake. He was later club champion at four different clubs. He represented Ayrshire 1947-52 and Hertfordshire 1960-63, captaining the Hertfordshire team that won the English Counties Championship in 1962/63. More recently he became captain, then president, of Royal Troon Golf Club, where he played regularly until 2019. Jimmy served as vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1997 to 2000. He had high principles and a humble and egalitarian outlook. He was passionate about education as the route to improving society. He is survived by three of his children, Linda, Fiona and me, from his marriage to Irene (nee Morris), who died in 1988, and by his second wife, Christine (nee Strickland), whom he married in 1992. Another son, Donald, died in 2016.",News/Education,Sir James Armour obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/06/sir-james-armour-obituary
1/7/2022,"This weekend, Novak Djokovic should have been warming up for yet another grand slam. But instead the world No 1 tennis champion – and noted vaccine sceptic – is cooling his heels in an Australian quarantine hotel, while an international row rages over whether he should be kicked out of the country altogether. Djokovic had boasted on social media of securing an exemption, for medical reasons he has not explained, to the rules that all players in the Australian Open must be double-jabbed. But hours later he was stopped at the airport, his visa cancelled, and he was unceremoniously threatened with deportation. His lawyers are challenging that ruling, meaning the outcome of this particular tournament may now be determined in a court – rather than on one. Not since the actor Johnny Depp and his then wife, Amber Heard, flew their two dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country by private jet without the necessary paperwork has the power of celebrity met the force of Australian biosecurity requirements with quite such explosive results.  In fairness to Djokovic, this farce may not be entirely his fault. Someone somewhere, either in his camp or in Australian tennis, may have screwed up by allowing a situation to arise where the tournament’s biggest box office draw was seemingly given a free pass to compete in the country, but not actually to get there. Yet few tears will be shed for the man now inevitably known as “Novaxx” Djokovic. Around the world, patience with those who are wilfully unvaccinated is running out in the face of yet another viral surge. Just over a month ago, I wrote about how the mood might harden as intensive care beds filled with patients realising too late that they should have got the jab, while restrictions once again loomed over people who had done what was asked of them. Now that scenario is unfolding, with France’s President Macron playing to the gallery by vowing to do everything he can to “piss off” those who are unjabbed, while angry callers to British radio phone-ins demand anti-vaxxers be stripped of their right to NHS treatment if they get sick. Elsewhere in sport, the Premier League, facing a stubborn minority of unvaccinated top-flight footballers and fears of cancelled fixtures, has reportedly discussed making those who are unjabbed travel separately to games or eat their meals away from other players. It’s an uncomfortably divisive idea, stopping only just short of making them carry a bell and shout: “Unclean! Unclean!” But what if the alternative is double-jabbed players growing increasingly resentful at having to sit matches out because they’re isolating, after contact with infected teammates? Balancing the incontrovertible human right to refuse a vaccine against the rights of others not to be held hostage by that decision is the single biggest challenge of this stage of the pandemic, and that’s what makes Djokovic’s case resonate far beyond tennis. There is an undeniably ugly undercurrent to some of this hostility towards the unvaccinated, who are disproportionately likely to be poor, marginalised and from minority-ethnic backgrounds. Punishing people who often have deep-seated reasons not to trust the authorities for failing to get their jabs not only risks heaping discrimination upon discrimination, but represents a profound failure to understand why they didn’t want to comply in the first place, which makes it impossible to convince them to change their minds. But there’s nothing obviously marginalised about a millionaire sportsman arrogantly demanding the right to jet into a country suffering record infection rates in hopes of lifting yet another lucrative trophy. Australians have endured restrictions so draconian that thousands of them stranded abroad at the start of the pandemic weren’t even allowed back into their own country. Djokovic has less in common with an agonised British care worker, on minimum wage, facing the sack if they don’t get the jab, than with a frequently more middle-class form of anti-vaxxer who slips under the radar. He is a believer in “natural” healing who once suggested that polluted water could be cleansed by the power of positive thinking, insisting that science had proved “that molecules in the water react to our emotions”. He’s entitled to hold whatever wacky beliefs he likes, of course, but he doesn’t have a God-given right to escape the professional consequences of them, and still less does he have the right to impose consequences on others. The clout he wields as an international sportsman, meanwhile, makes it all the more important that he be seen to follow the rules. “One rule for them, another for the rest of us” remains the single most toxic charge of the pandemic, whether levelled against Downing Street aides tucking into convivial Christmas wine and cheese at a time when ordinary mortals weren’t even allowed to see their own parents, or against big-shot Hollywood names granted entry to Australia for film and TV work when most people were barely allowed to leave their own homes. It taps into a sense of grievance about elites getting away with things the little guy can’t that is arguably never far from the surface of politics, visibly inflamed by a pandemic in which too many powerful people have been caught ducking the rules so painfully obeyed by others. No wonder Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister criticised for his own handling of the pandemic, leapt at the chance to declare that “rules are rules” and apply to everyone. Unlike tennis, fighting a pandemic is a team effort. If he doesn’t want to be booed off the next court he actually gets to play on, Djokovic would do well to remember that.

1/7/2022,"Bill Bryden, who has died aged 79, was a terrific director and writer whose work was dominated by two governing ideas: a belief in ensemble and a passion for everything American. Both could be seen in his tenure as one of Peter Hall’s associates at the National Theatre from 1974 to 1985, where he directed Tony Harrison’s version of The Mysteries and numerous American plays including the world premiere of David Mamet’s Glengarry Glen Ross. As Hall shrewdly said in his autobiography, “Bill’s strengths are his obsessions” and “for him, work in the theatre has to be work among friends.” Bryden learned his craft as a director at the Belgrade, Coventry, and then at London’s Royal Court from 1967 to 1971. But it was in his native Scotland, at Edinburgh’s Royal Lyceum, that he first attracted attention. Growing up in Greenock, he was fascinated by his nation’s industrial history and in 1972 wrote and directed a stunning play, Willie Rough, about a shop-steward involved in socialist battles in the Clydeside shipyards. But, although it was that production that led to his invitation to join the National Theatre, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of his Greenock upbringing. It not only gave him a belief in the power of the collective but also, through thrice weekly visits to the movies, a preoccupation with America that, in 1980, prompted him to write the script for a Hollywood western, The Long Riders.  It was his work for the National that marked him out as a first-rate director. He even survived an early disaster when, in 1976, Hall invited him to stage a Goldoni comedy, Il Campiello, to officially launch the Olivier theatre. Played in front of a distinctly unamused Queen, the production died a public death and Hall had to resist the board’s injunction to give Bryden the sack. His faith paid off a year later when, on a snowy Easter Saturday, Bryden staged The Crucifixion on the riverside terraces outside the National. That was to be the start of one of the great projects of postwar theatre. Growing incrementally, The Nativity and The Passion were eventually joined by Doomsday to form The Mysteries, which played in a single 12-hour day at the Cottesloe in 1985. Harrison’s alliterative text, Bill Dudley’s domesticated design employing dustbins and colanders and John Tams’s music, along with a cast that included Jack Shepherd, Karl Johnson and Brian Glover, were all crucial to the production’s success. But it was Bryden’s vision that made The Mysteries a genuinely communal experience, in which a predominantly secular audience was temporarily turned into awayday Christians. Bryden’s obsession with everything American also paid off in fine productions of Eugene O’Neill (The Long Voyage Home, Hughie, The Iceman Cometh), Arthur Miller (The Crucible) and David Mamet (American Buffalo and Glengarry Glen Ross). It was often said, with some justice, that Bryden was most at ease directing men. But he also understood perfectly the fear and panic that underlies the blue-streaked bluster of Mamet’s petty traders and vaunting salesmen. Bryden returned to his native Scotland to write and direct two epic pieces of popular theatre staged in the Harland & Wolff shipyards in Glasgow’s Govan: The Ship (1990) and The Big Picnic (1994). If the characters were thinly drawn, both pieces created memorable effects: in the latter I remember the Angel of Death hovering over a battalion of gassed, maimed Glaswegian soldiers in the hell of the first world war. Bryden also directed for opera and cinema but his supreme gift, shown at its height in The Mysteries, was for creating a shared experience in which we, as members of the audience, became not just spectators but willing, enthusiastic participants.",Arts/Stage,Bill Bryden: supremely gifted director who harnessed the ensemble’s power,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/06/bill-bryden-director-died-aged-79
1/7/2022,"Joe Biden on Thursday forcefully denounced Donald Trump for spreading a “web of lies” about the legitimacy of the 2020 election in a desperate attempt to cling to power. The US president condemned his predecessor’s efforts as a “failed” pursuit, but one that continues to threaten the foundations of American democracy one year after the insurrection at the US Capitol when extremist Trump supporters tried, on 6 January last year, to overturn the official certification of Biden’s presidential election victory.  In a speech from the Capitol marking the first anniversary of the deadly assault, Biden was unsparing in his assessment of the harm caused by Trump’s “undemocratic” and “un-American” attacks on the institutions of democracy. Though Biden never mentioned Trump by name, he was explicit in blaming the former president for fomenting the violence that led his supporters to place a “dagger at the throat of American democracy”. “For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol,” Biden said. “But they failed. They failed.” And yet the falsehoods and conspiracies that were a precursor to the violence which left five people dead and more than 140 law enforcement officers injured, still persist, Biden warned. He asked Americans to recommit to the protection of the nation’s 200-year-old system of government. “The lies that drove the anger and madness have not abated,” Biden said, speaking from the National Statuary Hall in the bowels of the Capitol. “We have to be firm and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote.” “At this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be,” he continued. Trump originally planned to hold a news conference from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday evening, but canceled under pressure from Republicans and conservative allies who worried it would be a harmful distraction on the day. But that did not prevent Trump from issuing a series of furious statements that continued to claim, falsely, that the election was “rigged”. “They got away with something, and it is leading to our country’s destruction,” Trump wrote in one such salvo that did not mention the violence of the day, or his role in inciting it and failure to quell it. Many Republicans will be physically absent from the Capitol, with most of the party’s senators, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, traveling to Georgia for the funeral of their former colleague Johnny Isakson, who died in December. In a statement, McConnell called the attack “antithetical to the rule of law” and said he supported efforts to hold accountable those who broke the law. But he did not denounce Trump, and quickly pivoted to partisan matters, denouncing Democrats for contemplating changes to the filibuster to overcome a Republican blockade of their voting rights legislation. However, Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, the vice-chair of the House select committee investigating the events of 6 January, told NBC News that Republicans who downplay the Capitol assault “should be ashamed of themselves”. “Unfortunately, too many in my own party are embracing that former president, are looking the other way, are minimizing the danger,” she said. “That’s how democracies die.” Biden’s speech opened a day-long program of events on Capitol Hill to mark the anniversary. Throughout the day, members of Congress planned to share their memories of the siege that sent them fleeing for their lives. House speaker Nancy Pelosi was scheduled to hold a moment of silence on the House floor, and later Democratic leaders will host a discussion on the importance of preserving an accurate historical record of the day with the Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden and prominent historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham. The day’s formal events will conclude with a prayer vigil on the Capitol steps. Speaking just before Biden, vice-president Kamala Harris, a former California senator who was in the Capitol working on 6 January last year, said the rioters not only defiled the building but assaulted “the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend”. In their comments, Harris and Biden called for the protection of voting rights. Harris urged lawmakers to pass the voting rights bills currently stalled before Congress. The insurrection was the last desperate attempt by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election, after a series of legal challenges and a pressure campaign failed. On that day, a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol after Trump delivered an incendiary speech, encouraging them to “fight like hell” as Congress convened to certify the election result. But lawmakers who had initially fled for their lives during the siege returned to the chamber, shaken but resolved, to make Trump’s electoral defeat official. In the year since the attack, elected officials, historians and democracy advocates have warned that the threat of future violence remains high. Trump and his allies have spent the past months rewriting the 6 history of January, downplaying the violence and shifting the blame. It was the the worst attack on the Capitol since it was burned by British forces in 1814. Much of Biden’s speech was devoted to establishing fact from fiction about the events of 6 January, as a revisionist history of the attack, promoted by Trump and his allies, takes root. “That’s what great nations do: they don’t bury the truth, they face up to it,” he said. “We must be absolutely clear about what is the truth and what is a lie.” “This wasn’t a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection. They weren’t looking to uphold the will of the people, they were looking to deny the will of the people,” Biden said. All the while, Biden charged, Trump watched the violence unfold on TV without intervening to call for calm. “His bruised ego can’t accept that he lost.”",News/US news,Biden condemns Trump’s ‘web of lies’ a year on from deadly Capitol assault,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/joe-biden-donald-trump-capitol-attack-anniversary
1/7/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s family have said he is the victim of “a political agenda” aimed at “stomping on Serbia” as protesters in Belgrade called for his release and Serbia’s president insisted “the whole country” was behind him. The 34-year-old world tennis No 1, who was born in the Serb capital, is in detention in an immigration hotel in Melbourne pending a legal challenge to Australia’s decision on Wednesday to cancel a visa that would allow him to play in the Australian Open.  Demonstrators gathered outside the Serb assembly on Thursday afternoon after a call for support from Djokovic’s family. The player’s father told a press conference that he could not be defeated “by anyone, not even the Australian government”. Djokovic was being “persecuted”, Sjrdan Djokovic said. “They’re keeping him in captivity. They’re stomping all over him to stomp all over Serbia and the Serbian people. [Scott] Morrison [Australia’s prime minister] and his like have dared attack Novak to bring Serbia to its knees.” Australian officials have said the player, who has refused to reveal his Covid vaccination status but previously said he was opposed to vaccination, was refused entry because he failed to meet vaccination exemption requirements. But Sjrdan said: “This has nothing to do with sports, this is a political agenda. Novak is the best player and the best athlete in the world, but several hundred million people from the west can’t stomach that.” Djokovic’s mother, Dijana, said he was being scapegoated and described the situation as scandalous. “Our Novak, our pride,” she said. “Novak is Serbia, and Serbia is Novak. They want to clip his wings, but we know how strong he is.” Displaying the nine Australian Open trophies Djokovic has won, the player’s father said Serbia was “a proud nation, a civilised nation, we have never attacked, just defended ourselves. That is what Novak is doing right now.” The Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, posted on Instagram that he had “told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and [we] are doing everything to see the harassment of the world’s best tennis player is brought to an end. In line with all norms of international law, Serbia will fight for Novak, truth and justice.” Vučić said he had spoken to Djokovic twice and to the player’s father multiple times, and Serb ministers were in touch with their Australian counterparts. “All are asking just one thing: to let Novak move out from this horrific hotel into a rented home,” the president said. What was “not fair”, he said, was “this political witch-hunt everyone is taking part in – even the Australian prime minister. But I am afraid this type of political ranting will continue. They want to prove something else. When you can’t beat someone then you do these kind of things.” While pro-government media were strident in their support for the player, many Serbians were more divided on the issue. “This is all against Novak,” said Milan Klaric, from the city of Vršac, two hours north-east of the capital. “They don’t like him so they use every means they can against him. How come that he got a visa and then it was revoked? They are afraid of him.” However, Jelena Goricki, also from Vršac, said she was not concerned by the player’s problems. “I really love how he plays, I cheer him on,” she said. “But this? Sorry, but I got my jab. He does not have my support.” Coronavirus infection rates in Serbia, while still relatively low, have nearly trebled over the past two to three weeks. The country has so far fully vaccinated less than half of its population, compared with an average in the EU of 70%.

1/7/2022,"The mere thought of Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City analysts sifting through footage of Swindon’s recent demolition of Northampton to prepare for an FA Cup third-round tie would have felt rather far-fetched when, in the midst of pre-season, the League Two club had only a handful of contracted players. To say they were operating on skeleton staff would be generous but these days the picture is markedly different and Swindon, too, will have done their homework when the teams meet on Friday. “I usually really enjoy watching them play … not so much this week,” grins their head coach, Ben Garner. When Garner was appointed two weeks before the season, there were only six available first-team players. Pre-season was repeatedly pushed back and so haphazard that no player had completed a full 90 minutes by the time they visited Scunthorpe on the opening day, a game that kicked to kick off a new era. A takeover by the Australian businessman Clem Morfuni, who appointed Garner, has breathed life back into the Wiltshire club. Before then, it was doom and gloom.  “The talk was: ‘Is the club even going to survive?’” says the midfielder Jack Payne. “Relegation is usually seen as the bottom and then things get better but things just carried on getting worse. There was a lot of negativity around the club, and you hear all of that, so for it to turn around as quickly as it has and now for there to be so much positivity is amazing.” For fans, a date with the Premier League champions promises to be an occasion to savour at a sold-out County Ground, after a testing couple of years. In July Swindon were rudderless: without a manager, chief executive, shirt sponsor or strength and conditioning coach. The remaining staff and players were awaiting outstanding wages. The goalkeeping coach, Steve Mildenhall, was in effect the last man standing and lumbered with sorting everything from sports science to logistics, assisted by the academy coach Lee Peacock, while the defender Mathieu Baudry helped organise training. Youth players and trialists made up the numbers. “The club was in a real mess and a lot of the players were sat at home thinking: ‘Will I be coming back in? Will I have to look for another club?’” says Ellis Iandolo, Swindon’s longest-serving player. “It was tough but once we found out about the takeover happening it was a matter of weeks before you could see a real change around the place. Training became exciting; you came in every day excited to see the new signings we were bringing in.” One of Morfuni’s first decisions was to appoint Rob Angus, former deputy chair of the club’s supporter trust, as chief executive. Angus juggled his role as a performance director at Nationwide for the first five weeks with getting a dozen new players, including the Wales winger Jonny Williams. There are still problems – they are contesting a winding-up petition and remain under an embargo that limits them to free transfers – but they are fifth in the league and primed to challenge for promotion. “We want to do well [against City], but I’d love to get three points at Mansfield on Tuesday night, which for me is a bigger game,” Garner says. If Swindon find themselves searching for evidence that City are fallible – the runaway Premier League leaders have won their past six games by an aggregate score of 21-4 – they need not look too far for inspiration. Swindon beat City in the Cup in 1910 and 1964, though Swindon’s heaviest defeat also came against City in this competition: 10-1 in 1930. “We’re certainly not going out there just trying to keep the score down,” Garner says. “We want to go out there and win the game and, as difficult as it may be, it’s not impossible.” Garner insists there are chinks in City’s armour but stresses his side must show courage to have any chance of an upset. “When we get the ball we need to make sure we are brave and not turning down forward passes,” says Iandolo. They can take comfort from the fright Cheltenham gave City in the fourth round last season when the former Swindon defender Ben Tozer’s long throw unsettled Guardiola’s side. Not that Garner is planning to unsettle City with such direct tactics. “It’s against what the game should be about,” he says. “I’m a purist. Slowing the game down, loading the ball up, and throwing it in the box are not things we will do. We are not going to change for one game, regardless of whom we are playing.” This week Garner suggested his skilful players make easy targets and need greater protection from referees, a gripe his City counterpart has previously voiced. It would have been easy to envisage him and Guardiola getting on swimmingly had they had the chance to share a post-match tipple, but Guardiola will miss the trip after testing positive for Covid, with Rodolfo Borrell taking charge. Swindon will not be rolling out the red carpet in any case. “If you start doing things for different managers, I think you’re being disrespectful to other managers within the game,” he says. “We’ll have the same post-match food and drinks as after every game.”",Sport/Football,‘You could see a change’: how Swindon bounced back to target Manchester City upset,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/swindon-manchester-city-fa-cup-bounced-back-upset
1/7/2022,"My father, Jack Clafferty, who has died aged 74, was the creator of a number of striking graphic images associated with the Troubles in Northern Ireland, most notably the familiar logo used by the Troops Out Movement, which featured a representation of a British soldier taking a club to the island of Ireland.  Jack, who moved to London from Ireland in the mid-1960s, made his images – from the early 70s onwards – as a result of a keen interest in the political situation in the north of Ireland at the time, but particularly triggered by the introduction of internment in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972. In 1973 he became a founder and key member of the Troops Out Movement and also played a leading role in the Anti-Internment League, helping to organise public meetings, pickets and events for both organisations while using his skills as a draughtsman to produce hand-drawn images that featured on badges, posters and in publications. Examples of his work can now be seen in the collections of the Linen Hall Library in Belfast and as far away as the Melbourne Museum in Australia. Jack was born in Buncrana in County Donegal, to Brigid (nee McEleney), a cook, and James Clafferty, a railway worker. The oldest of seven children, he attended Buncrana Technical school, where he showed an aptitude for technical drawing, leaving at 16 to work in a local builders’ merchants. At the age of 18, like many of his contemporaries, he emigrated to England, where he found work initially in a printing works before becoming a draughtsman with a series of London-based architectural firms, including Meers, Pring and Wager, and Pollard, Thomas and Edwards, working with the latter practice on the award-winning New Concordia Wharf, an early example of urban renewal in the London Docklands area. After a move to Newcastle under Lyme in Staffordshire in the late 80s he began to work for himself before retirement. Jack’s 1970 marriage to Anne Merryweather ended in divorce in 2004.
