1/16/2022,"Two Ohio siblings accused of cutting down a 250-year-old walnut tree are facing felony charges. Todd Jones and Laurel Hoffman said they believed tree was part of Jones' property. Prosecutors said the stump of the tree was about eight feet outside their property line. Two Ohio siblings were charged with felony theft after they cut down a centuries-old Black Walnut tree and arranged to have it logged and sold for lumber, Cleveland officials said on Friday. The tree was one of the largest of its kind in the state, officials said, according to Cleveland.com. Todd Jones, 56, and Laurel Hoffman, 54, are accused of chopping down the tree, estimated to be more than 250 years old, in September last year. Jones claimed the tree was part of his property in Strongsville, a suburb about 16 miles outside of Cleveland.  Prosecutors charged Jones and Hoffman, arguing that the tree was not on his property. Rather, they said the tree grew in a region owned by Cleveland Metroparks, which oversees 24,000 acres of nature reserves across the Greater Cleveland area. The charging documents say the stump was about eight feet outside their property line. Both Hoffman and Jones were charged on December 29, each receiving one count of theft by deception and falsification. Both charges are felonies that carry a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Michael O'Malley's office said, according to the New York Times. ""Given our urban setting and the threats to healthy tree growth, it is very uncommon to find a black walnut of this size,"" said Jacqueline Gerling, a spokesperson for Cleveland Metroparks, according to the Times. Officials said Jones first blamed his sister and then became defensive when authorities told him his mother-in-law, who lives in the house near the tree, had already told them that he and his sister had chopped it down, NBC News reported.   The tree was worth at least $28,800, the Cleveland Metroparks Police Department said. To replace the tree would cost over $100,000. ""It's not the crime of the century,"" Jones told the police, the Times reported.  Both Jones and Hoffman have said they don't believe they should face charges.  ""This is so ridiculous that they're doing this,"" Jones said in an interview with Cleveland.com. ""This is insane. There was no ill intent."" Jennifer Grieser, the director of natural resources at Cleveland Metroparks, said she in September last year had been walking through a reservation when she discovered a ""freshly cut"" stump where the tree had once been, according to the Times.  ""We will not ignore people trespassing onto park property and illegally cutting down irreplaceable trees for profit,"" said O'Malley, according to the Times.

1/16/2022,"It is called a superload, and for good reason: The highway behemoth is longer than five firetrucks and weighs as much as two blue whales. This week and next week, the mammoth tractor-trailer, hauling a tank from a decommissioned nuclear training site, will lumber across Pennsylvania on a 400-mile route that would test the skills of even the most seasoned trucker. The metal leviathan, which takes up two lanes of traffic, measures 213 feet from end to end and weighs 294 tons, putting merely oversize loads to shame. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times As it rolls across the state on what is expected to be a nine-day journey, the rig with several flatbeds and escort vehicles must cross 16 counties, navigating exit ramps, country roads, two-lane highways, unusual traffic patterns and a potential snowstorm. The truck can travel only at the posted speed limit or 30 mph, whichever is lower, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Unsurprisingly, drivers should expect delays if they find themselves caught behind the superload, although it is expected to travel mostly at night to cut down on bottlenecks, the department said. Lew Grill, a truck-driving expert and instructor in Montana with 54 years of experience on the road, said he had deep respect for any truck driver who could haul a 294-ton load. He said the weight limit for the average tractor-trailer is 40 tons, featherweight by comparison. “This is phenomenal,” Grill said. “If this guy pulls this off professionally, he should get accolades. We should bow to him. There are not many drivers like this.” Grill said the driver will need to respond to unforeseen challenges, such as cars stopped on the side of the road. The escort drivers are “only the extra eyes and ears of the captain of the ship,” he said. Ultimately, the truck driver is responsible for ensuring that the superload reaches its destination safely, he said. Although the tank is empty, it is radioactive because of its proximity to the D1G Prototype reactor, which had been used at the Kenneth A. Kesselring Site in West Milton, New York, near Saratoga Springs, to train Navy sailors on the operation of propulsion systems in the Navy’s nuclear-powered fleet. The prototype reactor was decommissioned in 1996, and the reactor’s fuel was removed in 1997, according to the Naval Nuclear Laboratory. The tank, which was part of a system used to support the prototype reactor, contains no residual fuel, according to Saralynne DelRaso, a laboratory spokeswoman. She said that a person who was close to the outside of the tank for one hour would receive less radiation exposure than a passenger might receive on a cross-country flight from New York to Seattle. DelRaso said the company that was transporting the tank planned to have three escort vehicles and three State Police vehicles accompany the truck. Since the trailer is wide, drivers may not pass on two-lane roads until the rig pulls to a stop and the escorts allow traffic to go by, she said. The shipment required numerous permits, all of which included advance notice of the operation as well as approval of the proposed route and timing, DelRaso said. The truck left the Kesselring Site on Jan. 5, and crossed into northeast Pennsylvania on Wednesday night, she said. It was expected to reach Wampum, Pennsylvania, about 41 miles north of Pittsburgh, on Jan. 21. The tank will then be disassembled, with some of it recycled and the rest discarded. A winter storm that is forecast to hit the Northeast over the weekend could complicate the journey. The National Weather Service has warned of hazardous road conditions, with early estimates of 4 inches of snow or more in parts of Pennsylvania. Perkins Specialized Transportation Contracting, a heavy-haul and superload logistics company in Becker, Minnesota, which was transporting the tank, declined to comment on the undertaking Thursday. But the job is not the biggest the company has completed. In the summer of 2018, it hauled seven engines weighing 318 tons each on a 61-mile route from a port in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, according to the company’s website. The shipment took more than 18 months to plan and 3 1/2 weeks to complete and required route surveys, feasibility studies and outside support teams. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was urging people to track the superload on social media with the hashtag #PAsuperload22. “It’s going to be team effort, with troopers from at least six different stations taking part at various intervals,” said Lt. Adam Reed, a State Police spokesperson. “Safety and security will be our top priorities, and we ask for patience as we ensure it safely gets to its destination.” © 2022 The New York Times Company",U.S./The New York Times,"'Superload' Lumbers Across Pennsylvania, Two Lanes Wide and as Heavy as Two Whales",https://news.yahoo.com/superload-lumbers-across-pennsylvania-two-151526930.html

 Passengers aboard a Norwegian cruise ship are stuck at sea this week after the cruise line decided to cancel the cruise mid-voyage due to COVID-19 concerns. Aimee Focaraccio, who boarded a 10-day cruise on the Norwegian Gem from New York, told USA Today that she was notified on Thursday that the cruise would be canceled due to issues related to COVID-19, but was not provided an early return date. ""We will arrive as per schedule on the 19th in the morning,"" cruise ship personnel reportedly said, according to a recording Focaraccio provided the news outlet. Focaraccio detailed that after the ship made a stop in St. Maarten on Friday, it would not be making any other stops at ports or islands. ""I really can't imagine four more sea days back to back without much to do,"" she told USA Today. She also added that earlier on Friday the ship made the decision to forgo port calls in Grand Turk, St. Thomas and Tortola prior to its arrival in St. Maarten and before the decision was made to cancel the remainder of the stops. Norwegian Cruise Line's senior vice president of branding and communication Christine Da Silva told USA Today that the Norwegian Gem was scheduled to return to New York ""shortly,"" without providing a definite date. ""As we continue to navigate the fluid public health environment, while focusing on delivering a safe experience for all on board, today, we made the difficult decision to cancel Norwegian Gem's current Caribbean sailing, due to COVID-related circumstances,"" Da Silva reportedly said. Despite the cruise line's assertion that ""COVID-related circumstances"" were the reason for canceling sailing, Focaraccio told USA Today that she was not made aware of coronavirus cases on the ship. All passengers on the Norwegian Gem were reportedly given a full refund or cruise credit and an additional cruise credit equivalent to 50 percent of the current trip fare for to be applied to a future cruise by May 2023.",U.S./The Hill,Passengers stuck at sea after Norwegian cancels cruise mid-voyage,https://news.yahoo.com/passengers-stuck-sea-norwegian-cancels-123948589.html

Footage filmed by Pacifica resident Savannah Peterson shows sea foam and waves crashing along the beachfront on Saturday morning. “I regularly shoot wave footage here but I have never seen anything like this tsunami,” Peterson told Storyful. The National Weather Service forecast tsunami waves of one to three feet, which may also coincide with high tide. Low-lying areas such as harbors and shallow waters were expected to see minor to moderate flooding, the agency said. Tsunami warnings were also issued for areas in the pacific, including Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

1/16/2022,"By John Shiffman WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The largest satellite provider in the United States said late Friday it will drop One America News, a move that could financially cripple the rightwing TV network known for fueling conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. The announcement by DirecTV, which is 70% owned by AT&T, comes three months after a Reuters investigation revealed that OAN’s founder testified that AT&T inspired him to create the network. Court testimony also showed that OAN receives nearly all of its revenue from DirecTV. To read the Reuters report, click here: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att/ The Reuters report drew calls from some liberal groups for AT&T and DirecTV to drop OAN, a favorite of former President Donald Trump, because the network has become a key source of false claims about the election and COVID vaccinations. On Thursday, President Joe Biden said COVID conspiracy theories are putting lives at risk. “I make a special appeal to social media companies and media outlets: Please deal with the misinformation and disinformation that’s on your shows,” Biden said. “It has to stop.” OAN is owned by San Diego-based Herring Networks, a family of conservative tech entrepreneurs. CEO Robert Herring Sr did not respond to requests for comment by email and phone. In an interview with Reuters last year, he said his network provided an important voice. “If I think I’m right, I just go for it,” he said. DirecTV, with approximately 15 million subscribers, is by far OAN’s largest carrier. According to testimony by OAN’s accountant reviewed by Reuters, DirecTV provided 90% of the conservative network’s revenue. “We informed Herring Networks that, following a routine internal review, we do not plan to enter into a new contract when our current agreement expires,” DirecTV said in a statement. The OAN-DirecTV contract is set to expire in the next several months. DirecTV began airing OAN in April 2017, a deal that began shortly after OAN and AT&T settled a lawsuit over alleged oral promises during negotiations. On Twitter, some conservatives expressed outrage that DirecTV and AT&T planned to drop OAN. “Corporate Media is crushing what little dissent remains,” tweeted former Fox News host Lou Dobbs. The pro-Trump right, however, has powerful outlets on television and online, including Fox News, the conservative cable news outlet founded by Rupert Murdoch. Liberals cheered the news. NAACP President Derrick Johnson called it “a victory for us and the future of democracy.” In a statement, Johnson added: “At a time when we are seeing our rights infringed upon, OAN only seeks to create further division. … We must continually choose truth over lies and common sense over hysteria.” The news also follows a lawsuit filed on December 23 by two Georgia election workers who accused OAN and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani of spreading false vote-rigging claims about them in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. The claims were debunked by state authorities. OAN has denied it has done anything wrong. DirecTV did not elaborate on why it planned to drop OAN. Earlier, an AT&T spokesman said the company airs “many news channels that offer viewpoints across the political spectrum.” The Reuters investigative report in October cited sworn statements in which OAN’s founder and his son testified that the inspiration for the conservative network came from AT&T executives. “They told us they wanted a conservative network,” the elder Herring said during a 2019 deposition. “They only had one, which was Fox News, and they had seven others on the other side. When they said that, I jumped to it and built one.” During a 2020 court proceeding, a transcript shows, an OAN lawyer told the court, “If Herring Networks, for instance, was to lose or not be renewed on DirecTV, the company would go out of business tomorrow.” (Reporting by John Shiffman.

1/16/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A former Mexican state prosecutor was so corrupt even the crooks who paid him off couldn’t trust him, according to a report released this week by the Mexican government’s Interior Department. The department's National Search Commission issued the report as part of its work to uncover the fate of hundreds of people who disappeared in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit between 2013 and 2017, when Edgar Veytia served as state attorney general. The report says Veytia initially took bribes to favor a gang allied with the Beltran Leyva cartel from 2013 to 2017. But it says Veytia switched sides in 2017, to ally with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. That change of alliances angered the Beltran Leyva gang, and lead to rounds of reprisal attacks and disappearances that apparently continue. The report says toward the end of Veytia’s time as the chief prosecutor of Nayarit, his office was actually recruiting youths to work for the Jalisco cartel. The state attorney general's office formed “an execution group” that worked for the cartels, and according to the report, “the attorney general's criminal structure may possibly still be operating, now for another criminal organization.” The report says parts of the state government essentially acted like a gang, with officials from police officers to judges cooperating to kill, threaten, torture or jail rival gang members. In 2019, Veytia was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison in a U.S. drug-trafficking case accusing him of using wiretaps and other law enforcement tools to protect the turf of a drug cartel. Veytia told a judge in federal court in Brooklyn that he made a “mistake” by taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from the cartel while he was the state's chief law enforcement officer. Veytia - a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen who had lived off and on in San Diego - had pleaded guilty to charges he took bribes from a drug organization.",U.S./Associated Press,Ex-Mexican prosecutor so corrupt he betrayed drug cartel,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-mexican-prosecutor-corrupt-betrayed-234929402.html
