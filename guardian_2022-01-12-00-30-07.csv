1/12/2022,"The Metropolitan police have been accused of “deferring to the powerful” by not investigating Downing Street parties held in apparent breach of lockdown rules. The force on Monday said it was in touch with the Cabinet Office in light of “widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020”.  The statement came after the leak of an email from one of the prime minister’s top officials inviting more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party during the first coronavirus lockdown. One senior police source with close knowledge of the regulations said the May 2020 gathering in the garden of No 10 organised by the PM’s aide was a clear breach of the regulations in force at the time. “A booze-up in the garden is not in keeping with the regulations,” they said. Jane Connors, acting deputy assistant commissioner, who leads for the Met on coronavirus enforcement, was on Tuesday considering the Met’s next steps, and whether the force needed to abandon its policy of not retrospectively investigating alleged Covid breaches, amid warnings the stance is sapping public trust in policing. The Met’s stance will face a challenge with the force facing court action to try to force it to justify its failure to act. The Good Law Project said it had started legal proceedings over the Met’s refusal to investigate the 18 December Downing Street party. The campaign group said that in letters between it and the Met, police said they had “relied on the government’s assurances that no rules had been broken” and “there would have been no point in interviewing Number 10 staff about the parties because they would have refused to answer questions that exposed them to a risk of prosecution”. Jo Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “You can have the rule of law, or you can defer to the powerful. But you can’t have both. Cressida Dick’s cat will know that multiple criminal offences were committed. It shames the Met, and ultimately all of us, that she refuses to investigate.” The Met also faces questions about whether its officers knew of the May 2020 gathering as it took place and potentially could have taken action then. The Green arty peer Lady Jones said the invitation to the May 2020 garden party, sent by Johnson’s top aide, Martin Reynolds, was troubling. She said: “This garden party raises big questions for the Met police, as their officers must surely have monitored this gathering via their security cameras and been aware of the rules in place at the time. “The police are losing public trust with their attitude that there are lots of rules for us and no rules for Conservative ministers. Did Martin Reynolds consult with Met police officers about the Covid restrictions, or inform them of the event?.” The Met have so far said only that they are aware of the latest revelations and in touch with a Cabinet Office inquiry conducted by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. She could choose to refer matters to the police, it is understood. The force is mindful that any penalty for a breach would only be a fine, but parliament did give it the power to investigate allegations up to three years after they took place. For other relatively minor offences the time limit is much less at six months. Downing Street said Gray’s inquiry would be “paused” if the police decided to conduct their own investigation. The prime minister’s official spokesperson on Tuesday said: “I think the Cabinet Office has been clear that they’re in contact with the police and obviously the police have the ability to start an investigation should they see fit to do so. “That would then pause the work has been done by the Cabinet Office team.”",News/UK news,Met police accused over failure to investigate No 10 lockdown parties,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/met-police-no-10-lockdown-parties
1/12/2022,"The world’s first transplant of a genetically-altered pig heart into an ailing human is a landmark for medical science, but the operation, and the approach more broadly, raise substantial safety and ethical concerns. Surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical Center spent eight hours on Friday evening transplanting the heart from the pig into 57-year-old David Bennett, who had been in hospital for more than a month with terminal heart failure.  It was an exceptional procedure. Doctors considered Bennett to be facing near-certain death, and deemed him too ill to qualify for a routine human heart transplant. As a last resort, the medical team sought emergency authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration to transplant a heart from a genetically altered pig. The heart came from a the pig created by Revivicor, a spin-out from PPL Therapeutics, the UK company that created Dolly the Sheep in 1996. Now under US ownership, Revivicor’s pigs are engineered to avoid immune rejection. Among the genetic alterations made are tweaks that remove a sugar molecule from the tissues that provokes organ rejection. The FDA approved the operation, along with the team’s proposal to use an experimental drug to prevent Bennett’s body from rejecting the organ. On Monday, doctors at the hospital said Bennett was awake and breathing on his own, but it was too soon to call the operation a success. Doctors are waiting to see how Bennett fares in the coming days, weeks and hopefully months. The prospect of harvesting organs from animals to save human lives has a long and chequered history. Advocates see the approach as a way to slash waiting lists for desperately ill patients, while animal rights activists see it as dangerous and ethically abhorrent. In the 1960s, US doctors transplanted chimp kidneys into more than a dozen patients, all but one of whom died within weeks. In the 1980s, a premature baby in California received a baboon heart but died three weeks later. The main risk is immune rejection: even with organs from human donors, recipients need constant immunosuppression to prevent their bodies from attacking the transplants. While Revivicor’s pig heart is designed to be less prone to immune rejection than standard animal organs, it is unclear how well it will be tolerated by the body. Because the organ comes from another species, Bennett will need more potent immunosuppression than usual, which comes with its own medical risks. Recent work on such donor animals has focused on pigs because, although they have different immune systems to humans, the animals’ organs are very similar. While much of the effort has been directed at making pig organs invisible to the human immune system, it is far from the only challenge. In the 1990s, scientists all but abandoned their work on donor pigs when they realised that retroviruses lurking in the animals’ DNA could potentially infect human cells. That raised the worrying prospect of transplanted organs spreading infection to the vulnerable patients who received them. Research is now afoot to overcome the problem, by taking genome editing to another level. After tweaking pig DNA to remove molecules that trigger immune rejection, scientists have made precision alterations that remove dozens of retroviruses from pig tissues in the hope that the organs will be safer when they are eventually transplanted. How well animal organs work will be for clinical trials to decide, rather than one-off operations. Many biotech firms are moving cautiously, setting up trials to check whether the organs are safe and effective, first in other animals and then in humans. For those with failing organs, the hope for now remains with the generosity of human donors.",News/Science,Why pig-to-human heart transplant is for now only a last resort,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/11/pig-to-human-heart-transplant-safety-ethical-concerns
1/12/2022,"Iam a veteran reader of Enid Blyton’s Faraway Tree books. I read them first growing up, and revelled in the thought of the different magical lands that could be reached at the top of an enormous tree – the Land of Take-What-You-Want! the Land of Goodies! Imagine being able to ask for an ice cream of any flavour, and going for sardine, as Connie did. Or flying on a dandelion seed in the Land of Giants. I dreamed of using a Slippery-Slip – the huge slide which goes down the centre of the tree. I imagined biting into a Hot Cold Goodie, or sucking a toffee shock. I wanted to creep past the Angry Pixie, watch Dame Washalot empty her buckets of water over Mr Watzisname (how much washing did she really need to do?), and make friends with Silky and Moonface. Then I read the books to my eldest child – and found myself not as charmed as I’d hoped. The Saucepan Man in particular was a little creepy and as ever with Blyton, there’s editorialising to be done while reading out loud, if you don’t want the girls to be told to stand aside for the boys.  But! I could see how much she loved the stories, and so I read them again to my middle child, and then again to my youngest, and I found myself reluctantly acknowledging the Faraway Tree’s charms once more. After all, I’m not the target audience any more, and all three have been entranced by it. For each of them, The Enchanted Wood has been the title that moved them across from picture books to chapter books as a bedtime story. And every time, as we’ve begun it, I’ve watched that spark of imagination kindle in their eyes, as the children (in my day Jo, Bessie and Fanny, now Joe, Beth and Frannie) enter the wood, and hear the “wisha, wisha, wisha” of the trees whispering their secrets to each other. So I’m delighted to hear that there’s going to be a new Faraway Tree story, by the mighty Jacqueline Wilson – the first in 75 years, and the first by an author who is not Blyton. Wilson seems perfect for the role – she’s already given us retellings of What Katy Did, Five Children and It and The Railway Children, and she was “a huge fan” of the books as a kid. “I had such fun writing a brand-new Faraway Tree book,” says Wilson in the announcement. “I read the three original Enid Blyton books many times as a child, marvelled at all the adventures and wished I could be Silky’s best friend and share Moonface’s toffee shocks. It’s a privilege to be able to write about Blyton’s iconic characters and invent new children and magical creatures of my own for new readers to enjoy.” In Wilson’s story, which is published in May, three new children find the Enchanted Wood while on holiday – Milo, Mia and Birdy. They meet Silky and her crew, and travel to the Land of Unicorns. “But not every land is so much fun. Danger looms in the Land of Dragons. Will Moonface’s magic work in time to save the children?” says publisher Hachette. Yes, undoubtedly it will, but this is news that will win the heart of my dragon-obsessed bookaholic eight-year-old, and a book I’ll be reading to my five-year-old as soon as it’s out. The 11-year-old will undoubtedly see herself as far too grown up for it these days – but I wouldn’t be surprised if she finds herself in the vicinity, come story time.",Arts/Books,Jacqueline Wilson is a perfect pick to reinvent Enid Blyton’s Faraway Tree,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/11/jacqueline-wilson-is-a-perfect-pick-to-reinvent-enid-blytons-faraway-tree
1/12/2022," The biological son of saxophonist Jimmy Heath, brought up by Dizzy Gillespie sideman James Forman, James Mtume was raised in jazz. His first appearance on record was on the 1969 album Kawaida, credited to his uncle, drummer Albert Heath – and on subsequent reissues to Herbie Hancock or Don Cherry, both of whom perform on it. But, really, Kawaida is Mtume’s album: he wrote every track bar one, and it was his interest in the pan-Africanist theories of Maulana Karenga that informed the project. It ranges from intense free jazz to more becalmed modal outings: Baraka falls into the latter category, a perfect introduction. Mtume first came to prominence as percussionist in Miles Davis’ early 70s band, which was still causing controversy decades later – for years, it seemed no Davis documentary was complete without someone, usually critic Stanley Crouch, decrying them as either a cluttered noise or a craven capitulation to commercial forces. It has to be said, there exist more obviously craven capitulations to commercial forces than the music on 1974’s incredible Get Up With It, an album Mtume is all over. Listen to his congas fluttering, as one writer put it, “like bats” during the stunning, subdued, ambient-inspiring Duke Ellington tribute He Loved Him Madly – but let’s go with the track named in his honour, which Mtume powers along. Saxophonist Sonny Rollins recorded it first, Mtume’s own 1977 version went on for 22 minutes, but the best take on his Afrocentric jazz tribute to Ancient Egypt might be the one on Lonnie Liston Smith’s Cosmic Echoes album: a blissful eight-minute drift, powered by an insistent bassline, garlanded with spacey synth and electric piano. Just as his career as a R&B songwriter and producer was taking off, Mtume put out one final burst of spiritual, Afrocentric jazz, the album Rebirth Cycle. Never reissued legally and unavailable on streaming services, a bootleg or YouTube are your only real options, but it’s worth checking out: the lengthy version of Sais is great, and the collection of shorter, soul-influenced tracks on side two – including Umoja – are fabulous, complete with vocals from Jean Carne of Don’t Let It Go to Your Head fame. Recruited for Roberta Flack’s band, Mtume made it his business to reignite the singer’s relationship with troubled duet partner Donny Hathaway, encouraging them to record his ballad The Closer I Get to You together. A huge hit in 1978, it paved the way for an album-length follow-up to 1972’s Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, but Hathaway’s erratic behaviour caused Mtume to temporarily abandon the sessions: hours after taping his vocal on Back Together Again, Hathaway returned to his hotel and killed himself. It seems extraordinary that such a transcendent, life-affirming piece of music could have emerged from such desperate circumstances, but Back Together Again is 10 minutes of euphoric disco glee. As the 70s turned into the 80s, Mtume and songwriting/production partner Reggie Lucas – another former Miles Davis alumnus – transformed singer Stephanie Mills from a Broadway star, who spent five years in the cast of The Wiz, into an R&B chart regular. The four albums they made with her are packed with highlights – What Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin’, Starlight, Two Hearts – but the commercial peak was the Grammy-winning Never Knew Love Like This Before: pillow-soft, lushly orchestrated mid-tempo disco, inspired by the birth of Lucas’ first child. A few years back it was used, to heartbreaking effect, in the second series of Pose. The debut album from Mtume’s own R&B project dealt in classy funk and luscious ballads – check out the oft-sampled Love Lock – but the group really hit its stride as disco gave way to the more electronic sound of boogie. The highlight of Mtume’s second album In Search of the Rainbow Seekers, So You Wanna Be a Star blends opulent strings, muted horns and Chic-ish guitar with sharp, needling synth. It would be intriguing to know if Mtume and Lucas had anyone specific in mind when they wrote the lyrics, which pick apart a celebrity heading for a fall (“your entourage sure looks shady”): whoever it’s about, the results are both sophisticated and sassy. Before hooking up with Mtume and Lucas, Phyllis Hyman had worked with a succession of fantastic writers and producers – Skip Scarborough, Earth Wind & Fire’s Philip Bailey and, on her heart-stopping sleaze anthem Loving You Losing You, Thom Bell. But the sound of 1981’s You Know How to Love Me is the definition of what Mtume called his “sophistifunk” style: rhythms aimed at the dancefloor, “pretty melodies”, a hint of jazz still lurking somewhere in the mix. It’s a toss-up as to whether the title track or Under Your Spell is the best thing here, but if the former deserved to be a far bigger hit – which was pretty much the story of the under-appreciated Hyman’s career – it nevertheless rightly became one of her signature songs. Mtume didn’t endear himself much to the burgeoning hip-hop scene by loudly demanding in the late 80s that artists who were sampled got paid, but that didn’t seem to stop people actually sampling him: at the last count, Mtume’s biggest hit – a ballad that stripped his sound back to little more than a drum machine, a synth, a scattering of guitar and some dubby echo – has been borrowed over 100 times, by everyone from Stetsasonic to Jennifer Lopez, but most famously on the Notorious BIG’s 1994 smash Juicy. Wrigley attempted to sue over the title, before Mtume explained to their lawyers the song had nothing to do with chewing gum – “it’s about oral sex” – an experience he later described as “one of the highlights of my life”. Mtume’s Theater of the Mind album was effectively James Mtume’s farewell to the music industry. Almost entirely electronic, it sounded perfectly of the moment, but the cynical lyrics, unmistakably the work of a man who’d grown up in the politically militant Black Power era, suggested someone who’d had enough of pop in the 80s – MTV comes in for a bashing – and indeed of the Reagan 80s themselves. New Face Deli finds him railing against plastic surgery as a “cop out”, perhaps with one eye on the era’s biggest black star – “who said a big nose was ugly? Who said a thin nose is in?” He shifted into working in theatre the following year: R&B’s loss.",Arts/Music,"Jazz, R&B and ‘sophistifunk’: James Mtume’s greatest recordings",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/11/james-mtume-hits-recordings-jazz-funk
1/12/2022,"When any crisis faces the country, it falls to the government to act, and to do so swiftly. So with the energy crisis, we need the government to stop the dither and delay of the last decade and act. In contrast, Labour has already put forward a bold plan to levy a windfall tax on oil and gas producers, who have made billions in this crisis, to limit the expected price rise in April. Our package would save most households about £200, and we would also target extra support to 9 million of the lowest earners, pensioners and the squeezed middle, taking up to £600 off their bills.  But crisis response is about learning the long-term lessons, not just taking short-term action. Of course, there is a global dimension to this crisis, but the British people have a right to ask why we have been hit so badly. In no other country have 28 energy suppliers gone bust – consumers will have to pick up the tab with £100 on bills and rising. They also have a right to ask why our energy system seems so vulnerable to the volatility of international markets and why we have a social safety net that seems so weak and inadequate. This crisis is a parable for the problems of Tory Britain. First, just as the banking crisis of 2008 exposed the deep flaws at the core of British capitalism, the present crisis is a symptom of the Conservatives’ failure to properly manage our energy policy or regulate markets. Despite warnings from Labour and others at the time, they allowed the UK’s last major domestic gas storage facility to close in 2017 and they ignored repeated warnings that the drive to increase competition in the energy market was being pursued at significant risks to consumers and, in fact, loosened regulations in the middle of the decade. Second, while some people will tell you that the move towards green energy is the cause of the crisis we face, the truth is the opposite. It’s is our dependence on fossil fuels that makes us more vulnerable and the government’s climate delay that has left us less resilient. Take energy efficiency. A proper home insulation plan could have significantly reduced household energy demand, and therefore our reliance on gas. But we have had systemic failure from the government, with the abolition of the zero carbon homes standard, the disastrous green deal and the chaotic Green Homes Grant. Emissions from buildings are as high now as they were in 2015. We have also seen an effective moratorium on onshore wind, cuts to solar subsidies and the stalling of the nuclear programme. All have made us less resilient. Third, we cannot divorce this crisis from the wider economic model we have. This crisis exposes the deep insecurity that is now baked into the British economy. Even before this crisis, too many people were living from paycheck to paycheck and without proper savings. And it is not just those on the lowest incomes; many middle-income earners have also seen their economic security undercut by rising prices, too. The answers on offer from both wings of the Conservative party are inadequate. Dumping the green transition overboard would not just invite climate disaster but make us far more vulnerable as a country, because we would remain reliant on fossil fuels with all the instability we have seen. Nor can we have any confidence that this government can provide the long-term solution we need. It speaks volumes about the Conservative party, its defence of vested interests and its refusal to stand up for working people that it is opposing the windfall tax and the measures it would fund. A Labour government will bring the long-term changes we need. We need to take a step back and look at the way the energy system works in its entirety. That’s about the regulation of the market, but more broadly about how we have a grid, transmission, generation and supply system that can properly meet the demands of affordable energy bills, security and the climate transition. There are crucial questions to address, including the way that the price of electricity is still tied to gas, the need for clean energy storage and how we have a grid that can be ready for a zero carbon energy system. We will drive further and faster towards an urgent and just transition. We have pledged to put in place a £6bn a year retrofit and zero carbon housing programme every year over the next decade. Led by local authorities, our aim is to help insulate the 19 million homes in Britain that fall below adequate standards. This could cut households’ bills by up to £400 a year and reduce our emissions. And we would drive forward all the sources of zero carbon power we need. Fundamental to changing our country in the way we need to is fixing a broken economic model of low wages and low growth, leading to deep economic insecurity. That is where the Green New Deal and Labour’s £28bn-a-year climate investment pledge must be transformational. We will support and create good, unionised jobs in industries from offshore wind manufacture to a national nature service. The energy crisis is the product of a decade of Conservative failure. There is a new future to shape for our country if we take bold action. A Labour government would stand up to vested interests and put working people first. That is the way we will build an economy that is more prosperous, sustainable and secure for all.

1/12/2022,"Over the course of her first full season as a full-time professional on the WTA tour, Emma Raducanu will come to experience all too much frustration and disappointment as she adjusts to life on the road. In Sydney, her opening tournament of the season, Raducanu endured her first experience of such emotions as she was dismantled 6-0, 6-1 by Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan in 55 minutes. Afterwards, while Raducanu swiftly complimented her opponent, she explained that her expectations had been low. She was still only just finding her way back after testing positive for Covid in December. Raducanu says she did not play for 21 days in total and she was only just starting to play points in recent days. She had already withdrawn from her first tournament of the year in Melbourne.  “It’s tough but it’s good because I’m very proud and happy that I put myself out there,” she said. “I could have easily said it’s too soon and just play next week, but I wanted to really test where I’m at and obviously give myself some competitive points and matches. I think this will help in putting me in a better place for next week.” Regardless, Rybakina is one of the most talented young players on the WTA and she possesses a destructive game. She had additionally arrived in Sydney having reached the final in Adelaide last week, losing to Ashleigh Barty. She was ready and she simply dominated, lasering winners from all parts of the court. Raducanu has played very few players with the shotmaking ability of the Kazakh, with her sheer pace, weight and depth continually rushing Raducanu, who contributed to the one-sided scoreline by struggling with her serve. Rybakina thundered through the first nine games of the match and it was only when Raducanu was trailing 6-0, 3-0 that she finally clinched her first game, forcing a backhand error from Rybakina with some defence on game point. With a game finally on the board, Raducanu pumped her fist and smiled towards her supporters and her team. “I simply wasn’t going to lose love and love,” she said. “So that was my motivation.” No more games would come Raducanu’s way, but she picked up her bags and looked to see how she could improve. “After the match I got a box of balls and went straight to the practice court. I felt like I could have done some things better in the match, and I wanted to try and fix it straight away, just leave with a better feeling about it. So, yeah, we went on court. In her first match of the season Raducanu lost, badly, but she finished her obligations with a smile on her face. “Yeah, I was just fighting,” she said. “I mean, at the end of the day I just want to keep putting myself out there. Even if I keep getting knocked down and it’s just about getting back up and basically just falling in front. You’re one step better. You learn more.” In the first match of the night session in Sydney, Andy Murray had won his first match of the season to move into the second round with a brisk 6-3, 6-1 win over Viktor Durasovic in Sydney. Murray will next face Nikoloz Basilashvili, who he defeated at Wimbledon last year. While Murray did not catch Covid in the off-season, and was one of the few players who travelled to Abu Dhabi not to do so, he said his off-season was also disrupted anyway as he caught a “bad cold” and didn’t train for 10 days. But Murray is now in Sydney with his new coach, Jan de Witt, and as he discussed their arrangement, he made his ambitions clear: “Obviously what both of us want is results,” he said. “I don’t know obviously how long I’ll be able to compete for. I know that injuries can happen at this stage in your career and having been through what I have been through the last few years, so, you know, I want sort of instant results.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu loses first match of year in 55 minutes to Elena Rybakina,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/emma-raducanu-loses-first-match-of-year-in-55-minutes-to-elena-rybakina
1/12/2022,"Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland will be lifted from next Monday, Nicola Sturgeon has told the Holyrood parliament, as she said that “cautious optimism” around the impact of the Omicron wave would mean a phased lifting of the limits on events and hospitality settings introduced before Christmas. Prior to the statement, Holyrood’s presiding officer, Alison Johnstone, issued a strong rebuke to the first minister after her weekly Covid statement was reported by some media outlets, describing the leak as “disappointing and disrespectful”.  Sturgeon assured Johnstone there would be an inquiry into origin of the leak. This move – which ends the limit of 500 people at outdoor events that has been in place since Boxing Day – will mean that football fans can return to stadiums when the Scottish Premiership’s winter break ends next week, and that Scotland’s Six Nations rugby matches do not have to be played behind closed doors at Murrayfield. Sturgeon told MSPs that a combination of the “protective measures introduced before Christmas, responsible action on the part of the general public, and the rapid delivery of booster vaccines has had a positive impact”. “As a result, I will indicate that from next week we will begin to lift the measures introduced before Christmas – but that we will do so in a phased and careful way, starting with the removal of attendance limits on live outdoor events from Monday.” Sturgeon said she hoped to lift other restrictions in the coming weeks, including limits on attendances at live public events, the requirement for distancing between groups in public indoor places, and the requirement for table service in hospitality venues serving alcohol.",News/UK news,Scotland to lift Covid ban on large gatherings from Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/scotland-to-lift-covid-ban-on-large-gatherings-from-monday
1/12/2022,"As she balanced a canoe upside down on her shoulders, crossing from one stretch of water to the next with her eyes just about able to peek under the bow, Camara Chambers knew what it meant to be supremely happy. In that moment, she may not have been really sure where she was going, but as far as she was concerned, Chambers was exactly where she was supposed to be – getting lost in the great, wide outdoors of her adopted homeland – Canada.  City hikes are a great way for people to get to know Toronto, says Chambers London born and bred, Chambers was 25 when she arrived in Toronto a decade ago, eager to swap the “rat race life” she’d been living in England. Of all the changes that have come in the years since, her transformation into an avid outdoors-woman remains, to her, the most surprising and rewarding. “Growing up in north London, we just weren’t a very outdoorsy, let’s-go-camping family,” says Chambers, a senior manager at Ryerson University’s leadership lab, having previously led Volunteer Toronto, Canada’s largest volunteer centre. “Experiencing nature in that way wasn’t part of my experience. But here I’m able to go to so many beautiful places in the evenings and weekends. It hits me all the time what real work-life balance I have.” From top left: Chambers exploring Ontario’s waterways; out with a Let’s Hike TO group; and on a walk with her partner Graham. Photograph: above, Cole Burston/Guardian Chambers says that within weeks of arriving she knew she “had found her place”. Now she makes it her business to go to a lot of wonderful locations – and she doesn’t go alone. After catching the hiking bug early on in Ontario, she began to lead treks for others. This year she founded her own walking group called Let’s Hike TO, with TO standing for Toronto, Ontario. It’s aimed particularly at people of colour and newcomers to the city and province. She leads walks through the parks and ravines that pepper Ontario’s biggest city but also through urban settings, too, such as Toronto’s Insta-tastic Distillery District. Once home to a whisky distillery, its cobblestone streets are now lined with galleries, restaurants and boutiques. After a good hike, Chambers likes to raise a glass at the Rorschach Brewing Co, one of Toronto’s many craft breweries. Photograph: Cole Burston/Guardian Today Toronto is known for its breweries, and is said to be home to more than 70, each producing their own craft beers, with many offering tasty eats in cool locations. At the end of a guided walk, Chambers likes to head to one of her favourites, the Rorschach Brewing Co, where beers such as Truth Serum IPA and Decadence await. “A big part of the reason I do Let’s Hike TO is to see the look of wonder on newcomers’ faces, and also on Torontonians’ faces when I show them a part of the city that they didn’t know existed,” says Chambers. Looking ahead to 2022, she’s aiming to take walkers out of the city and farther afield. Ontario’s outdoor adventures are truly limitless, from far-flung Thunder Bay on Lake Superior in the north to the wetlands of Killarney provincial park and all the way south to Toronto’s doorstep. Chambers has already done her share of exploring far and wide, but is keenly aware there is still so much more to see. Top: the awe-inspiring beauty of Thunder Bay.

Photographs: top left and above, Getty Images; top right, Alamy Her list of favourite places begins at the location of that canoe adventure, Algonquin provincial park, a three- to four-hour drive north-east of Toronto. The vast park is Canada’s oldest and boasts more than 2,400 lakes formed when ice age glaciers retreated. All of which makes it perfect for what Canadians call “portaging” – paddling a canoe with camping gear and supplies through its stunning waterways, then carrying the canoe overground to the next body of water and jumping in again. “Learning how to actually carry an I-don’t-even-know-how-many-pounds canoe on my back to get it between two lakes and doing it for a week – just a fantastic experience,” Chambers smiles. “As I say to my partner Graham: I’m a girl from London … and here I am!” Here are some of her top tips for adventurers: Algonquin provincial park“My favourite place to go hiking or just to be outdoors is Algonquin. It’s the most perfect place for short hikes, long hikes, camping. In winter, you can throw on some snowshoes and just get lost in nature. The park and the region is famed for amazing wildlife and I’ve had to listen as friends returned from trips and spoke of deer, turtles, moose and even bears they’ve seen up there. So far I’ve had no such luck! I took a friend from London and the whole time she was eager to see a bear. I said: ‘You’re never going to see a bear!’ And even though a ranger told us there’d been lots or sightings, we didn’t spot one. I’m still on the lookout but I’d much prefer to see a moose.” From moose to bears, Algonquin is renowned for its wildlife. Photograph: Getty Images MuskokaSouth-west of Algonquin, Muskoka is the heart of what Torontonians call “cottage country” – lake-side cabins and laid-back resorts nestled in nature, with little hamlets and towns speckled in between that are perfect for exploring. At picturesque Muskoka, visitors can while away lazy days. Photograph: Shutterstock “Muskoka is magical,” says Chambers. “My parents visited a few years ago and I wanted to give them a taste of the relaxed country life. We rented a car and zipped up to Muskoka and spent the day in the sunshine on a boat cruise, and stopped for doughnuts at The Bakery in Gravenhurst. It was the perfect way to see a very different part of Ontario. Most people don’t know it, but the summers here are beautifully hot (think Caribbean weather). It’s a great area to stay in and relax, and to rent a canoe or kayak to go exploring.” Outdoor gems around Toronto“The thing I love about Toronto and the area around it is that there are so many landscapes. You have beaches – I adore the Toronto Islands in Lake Ontario, right beside us in the city. From them you see gorgeous views of the skyline. No one appreciates how good the skyline is until they get a vantage point like that. Another real favourite of mine is Ashbridges Bay park, which is right on the lakefront, and has places where you can walk, cycle or swim. Top: Ashbridges Bay park offers wildlife and stunning skyline views. Above: the Cheltenham Badlands. Photographs: Alamy. “But you don’t have to go far to feel as if you are in a different world. If you drive just to the north-east of the city you’ll find yourself in desert-looking terrain, a place called the Cheltenham Badlands, which is incredible. I imagine it looks like the surface of Mars – this blood-red colour in rolling hills. It’s great to go in autumn as the colours are changing, and there’s a fantastic cidery nearby called Spirit Tree that’s not to be missed.” The Spirit Tree cidery, a place for artisanal cider and rustic dining Niagara-on-the-LakeNiagara Falls attracts the crowds and it’s clear why. A breathtaking wonder of the world that offers a feast of adventure activities such as jet boat tours up the Niagara River, zip-lining over the falls or the chance to join an unforgettable boat tour up close to the foot of the falls. Top: the Bruce Trail, Canada’s longest footpath, starts near Niagara-on-the-Lake, below. Photographs: Getty Images/Alamy For a change of pace after all that excitement, Chambers loves the quaint, historic nearby town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, a gem of an escape close to the starting point for the Bruce Trail, Canada’s oldest and longest footpath stretching 560 miles (900km) across Ontario wilderness. “The falls themselves are beyond gorgeous but Niagara-on-the-Lake is an amazing base for exploring all the wineries nearby and has great hikes too,” she says. “The town itself looks as if it belongs in the 1800s. I genuinely thought it was a movie or TV set. You’re waiting for someone to call: ‘Action!’.” Above and top left: a snowy day in a Toronto park brings back happy memories of a winter trip to Wiarton, top right. Photographs: above and top left, Cole Burston/Guardian; top right, Getty Images Georgian Bay“Another part of Ontario that I love is Wiarton. It’s a small village nestled on Georgian Bay, three hours’ drive north-west of Toronto, where I took a trip a winter or two ago. The bay was frozen over and it was stunning to see snow for as far as the eye could see. There is a section of the Bruce Trail in Wiarton that is like walking through Narnia. Snowy, mystical, and stunning.” Pelee Island“I visited Pelee Island, in Lake Erie, a couple of years ago with some friends and loved seeing a different side of the province. The nature reserves there are havens for birds and wildlife. It’s where I saw a snake for the first time in real life. Trust me, there was a lot of screaming!” Pelee Island (top) is where Chambers saw her first snake, and is a haven for birds. The island’s lighthouse, dating from the 1830s, was restored about 20 years ago. Photographs: Enviro Foto, Alamy Much as she enjoys reminiscing about her Ontario experiences to date, Chambers’ eyes light up when she talks about how much there is still to explore and see.

1/12/2022,"The heroes of Barnsley’s coronavirus pandemic are cast in bronze in the heart of the town centre. A nurse, a carer, a teacher, a volunteer and a police officer are depicted on the gleaming new sculpture, along with the words: “Barnsley’s fierce love holds you forever in its heart.” Bereaved families were among the hundreds of people at the memorial’s unveiling in November. And in Barnsley many people are grieving. The South Yorkshire town has recorded more deaths from Covid-19 than anywhere else in the UK per head of population: a toll of 972 so far, but the number still rises.  The news that one of Boris Johnson’s top officials hosted a “bring your own booze” party in Downing Street in May 2020, when the UK was in the strictest stage of lockdown, was met with fury, dismay and cynicism in the town on Tuesday. “It’s disgusting,” said Audrey Myers, 61, serving customers at Pickles Fine Foods. “It’s one rule for us and another for them. If you’ve got money and power you can do what you want.” While appalled by the revelations, no one who spoke to the Guardian believed Johnson would face serious repercussions for allegedly attending the apparently lockdown-busting party. “I know what should happen,” said Myers. “He should resign. But he’s not going to. He will get away with it.” She added: “It’s not fair but it doesn’t matter what I think – it’s not going to change anything.” Mick Bishop, 59, is one of thousands of former Labour voters in South Yorkshire who ended years of political tradition and voted for Johnson’s Conservatives in December 2019. He was furious about the No 10 garden party. “It’s disgusting. People aren’t going to stick to the rules when they hear stuff like that,” he said, although he added that it was not likely to change how he would vote at the next general election. Bishop, who has sold CDs and watches on Barnsley market for a decade, said the news would embolden people to drop their guard against Covid, just as the region’s infection rate passes the peak of the Omicron wave in London: “People aren’t wearing masks like they used to. If anyone challenges them they will say: ‘Boris Johnson does what he wants so I will.’” Like many of the UK’s post-industrial towns, Barnsley has had a stubbornly high infection rate since the pandemic began. Coronavirus has thrived in places such as Barnsley, with its multigenerational households and large number of public-facing workers. The town currently has the seventh-highest infection rate in England, although the vaccination programme has slowed the risk of death and serious illness. But four more people have died of Covid in Barnsley since Christmas Day. James Higginbottom, 24, lost his grandfather to coronavirus in October 2020. The 77-year-old was one of the more than 175,000 victims of Covid in the UK. Like thousands of people across the country, his family were not allowed to visit their dying relative in his final days. Their only contact was a daily update from “incredible” staff at Barnsley hospital, Higginbottom said, and a final painful telephone call between father and son. “When you see revelations like [the Downing Street party] about the people making the rules flagrantly disregarding it – it’s disgusting, it’s disappointing,” he said. Higginbottom, who was elected as a Labour councillor last May, said he was dismayed Johnson had not come clean about whether he attended the May 2020 party, as several witnesses have alleged. “This is not about politics. This is about people’s lives and people who are grieving and are rightfully angry about what’s going on. We have a saying in Barnsley: ‘Don’t piss on my shoes and tell me it’s raining.’ That’s what it feels like the prime minister is doing.” At Mike’s Cards in the market, Rebecca Dawson, 43, said she had always disagreed with the need for lockdowns and the Downing Street party proved she was correct. “Boris having a party speaks volumes to how much they fear Covid. They weren’t exactly in fear of their lives, were they?” Others said they were sick of the near-daily torrent of allegations about rule-breaking by members of the government. Some were supportive of Johnson – one market trader, who did not want to be named, praised the prime minister for doing a “superb job” – and blamed the media for supposedly whipping up a storm. Stephen Price, the owner of EB Price & Son, which has sold fruit and vegetables in Barnsley for 65 years, said it was time for the media and public to move on from Covid rule-breaking controversies. “If this had come out three months into the pandemic I would appreciate the uproar, but I do feel it should be put to rest,” said Price, 68. But he added that did not mean a free pass for the prime minister. “I think he’s politically damaged at the moment. There’s been too many cases like this in recent months. The public are the ones who will ultimately decide [Johnson’s fate],” he said.",News/UK news,‘Disgusting’: Covid-hit Barnsley appalled by No 10 party reports,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/barnsley-residents-reaction-covid-no-10-party-reports
1/12/2022," Radio Lingua was among the first to recognise the potential of podcasts for language learning, launching Coffee Break Spanish in 2006. Now the network has a huge range of free materials for learners at every level – and not just Spanish but also French, German, Italian, Chinese, Swedish and English. Each episode follows the structure of a lesson, with native speakers talking as they would on the streets of Paris or Cologne, and an experienced teacher to explain it all. With episodes running for 20 to 30 minutes, it is easy to make practice part of your daily routine. Absolute beginners should start at season one. There are many podcasts that rhapsodise about the joys of running, or debate which gels will fuel your best ever marathon – but if you are just starting, you’re probably more concerned with the need-to-know. Run to the Top, hosted by Claire Bartholic is perfect for beginners who are yet to make running a habit. Advice is always offered with the sensible caveat that “no two runners are the same”, and is inclusive of different goals and experience levels (discussion of weight loss, for example, is restricted to dedicated episodes). I have been a regular Parkrunner for years, and take a tip or two from each episode to try on a Saturday morning. If you are not yet at that stage, Couch to 5K really is as effective as everyone says. If you have the specific goal of training for a marathon, Marathon Training Academy comes highly recommended. I myself cannot speak to its effectiveness. If you have struggled to take meditation from a sticking plaster you reach for in moments of crisis, to a regular practice, Ten Percent Happier may help. Host Dan Harris wrote the 2014 bestseller of the same name about how he came to find “self-help that actually works” after having a panic attack on live television. His podcast includes interviews with experts on how to make mindfulness a part of daily life: from approaching tough conversations to managing work stress and finding self-acceptance. Many of the guided meditations are only 10 minutes long. Jill McSheehy’s “gardening adventure” began eight years ago, when her family was adjusting to a single income. She wanted to learn how to grow her own fruit, vegetables and herbs to save money, but encountered a steep learning curve. In 2017, she started this podcast to share what she had learned with others. McSheehy’s commitment to experimenting, in her 3,000 sq ft plot in Arkansas, sees her learn alongside her listeners. Recent episodes share the results of her attempts to deter cabbage caterpillars, and growing potatoes, tomatoes and onions. On this “literary matchmaking podcast”, host Anne Bogel talks to a listener about their “reading life”: the books they never wanted to end, the ones they couldn’t finish, and what is stopping them from reading more regularly – then makes suggestions for what they might read next. It’s refreshingly realistic on how reading can be something many of us struggle to make time for, as much as we may love it. Bogel makes unpretentious recommendations, leading her guests to a book that they can’t wait to read, rather than one they think they should. You will inevitably end up reading more.

1/12/2022,"Bus services in England used by hundreds of thousands of passengers are poised to be slashed when emergency Covid funding expires at the end of March, transport authorities have warned. Passenger numbers on buses have dropped sharply from 80% of pre-pandemic levels to less than 60% since the rise of the Omicron coronavirus variant and the introduction of work-from-home advice in December, leaving firms reliant on recovery grants to run services.  Bus firms, which have to give six weeks’ notice to withdraw a route, are compiling lists of services to be scrapped after 31 March. Many services depend on local council subsidy in places where bus operators cannot make a profit. But authorities now do not expect to find money to maintain such routes, typically serving isolated communities or hospitals and running outside peak hours. Buses in regions whose budgets have to cover fixed-cost transit systems, such as Tyne and Wear which has the Metro, are expected to be hardest hit. The funding crisis comes amid a driver shortage, affecting buses as well as the HGV and logistics sector. About 6,700 bus drivers are needed, with roughly 10% of positions vacant, according to the bus industry group, the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT). But while the Department for Transport has tried to rush through recruitment of lorry drivers, “there is no equivalent strategy for the driver shortage crisis on the buses”, says Jonathan Bray, director of the Urban Transport Group. A plan is urgently needed, he argues, “to prevent short-term driver shortage challenges leading to long-term bus service cuts”. The pandemic, driver shortage and financial gap spell a “perfect storm” for buses in 2022, according to Paul Tuohy, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport: “Covid has dealt a body blow to the bus industry, and without further government intervention we are likely to see severe cuts to services up and down the country.” The pandemic struck at a cruel moment for a sector that finally believed it was making political headway after a difficult decade in which more than 3,000 local authority-supported bus services were axed or truncated. Pleas for a national bus strategy were granted by ministers at a London conference in February 2020 – an event that instead made headlines for featuring the first confirmed case of coronavirus at a Westminster event. The strategy, entitled Bus Back Better, was published in 2021 framed with a prime ministerial pledge for £3bn in funding to transform services. However, the industry believes it has been left shortchanged. The autumn budget confirmed only £1.2bn, although the government says it will still have given £3bn in “new spending” on buses in this pandemic-hit parliament. Meanwhile, the commitments in the strategy would actually require a £7bn investment, according to the CPT. Among those encouraged by Boris Johnson’s professed support for buses was Tracy Brabin, the first elected mayor of West Yorkshire, who submitted an improvement plan for central funding after being elected this year. “A good service where you can rock up and expect a bus in a few minutes, not just in city centres but across the region, will be absolutely transformational,” she says. Instead though, operators are now “extremely anxious” and looking at reducing routes where patronage is lower, Brabin says: “Inter-community, inter-town bus networks fall by the wayside.” West Yorkshire stepped in to save one route recently, the 205 from Pudsey to Dewsbury, which Arriva wanted to cut, at a cost of £120,000 a year. However, for cash-strapped councils, with soaring care bills also vying for funds, such outlays can only be exceptions. “A better bus network is vital for us in West Yorkshire … I’m a user, a passenger, and it’s not good enough. We need government support,” says Brabin. “My concern is that the £3bn we were promised has been reduced – and a lot of that money is being used to hold up the existing service rather than transform it as we wanted to do.” The driver shortage has left people ever more frustrated. Brabin recently waited at a Leeds stop alongside a man whose bus for Cottingley failed to show. “When that bus doesn’t come, he’s got to wait another hour. Half an hour later I passed him on a different service and he was walking. It’s bad for family life, it’s bad for mental health – people don’t have ownership of their lives because it is dependent on whether the bus will come or not.” In Tyne and Wear, passengers are having to check online if their bus home will run, with daily short-notice cancellations. Tobyn Hughes, managing director of Transport North East, said: “Confidence in services is already low, and driver shortages were affecting reliability even before the latest round of Omicron.” However, Hughes says current woes are “nothing compared to what could come at the start of the next financial year. Unless there’s more money, it’s very likely that 10% to 17% of services will be cut.” The prognosis is grim around England: Transport for the West Midlands forecasts a £50m shortfall in bus funding after March without government intervention. Bus operators in the region have already notified them that they plan to cut eight routes, carrying 37,000 passengers a week. While rural routes have been hardest hit over the last decade avross Britain, city bus services are at particular risk where light rail and tram systems also require subsidy. Hughes’ budget has to cover the Tyne and Wear Metro, whose emergency funding will likewise expire in March: “There is a £20m shortfall. It has very high fixed costs. Transit systems will adapt but not overnight. We can’t reduce the costs on the Metro quickly – but you can on buses, unfortunately for those involved. “We are desperate for the government to pull its finger out and tell local authorities what, if any, Covid-19 support there will be for bus and light rail services after March.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We have provided unprecedented levels of funding for the bus sector during the pandemic, including the £1.5bn coronavirus bus service support grant and the ongoing £226.5m made available under the bus recovery grant. “As Omicron cases rise, we are closely monitoring the effect of new restrictions on passenger levels and services, working with the bus sector to understand their potential impact.” For many passengers already suffering cancellations from driver shortages, it will be hard to countenance further cuts. “We don’t have people to drive our buses. In the last six months complaints have soared,” said Dawn Badminton-Capps, director for England of passenger complaints organisation Bus Users UK. “Mainly services failing to show – and people getting wet and cold. In a city another bus might run soon – but for communities in places like rural Norfolk, that missing bus is it for the rest of the day. “We have people who say their employer is getting the hump and questioning if they can stay in the job. It’s not tenable for people to rely on buses if they won’t turn up.”                       ",News/Business,Bus services in England face axe as end to emergency Covid funding looms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/bus-services-in-england-face-axe-as-end-to-emergency-covid-funding-looms
