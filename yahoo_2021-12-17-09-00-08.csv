 Top New York City officials on Thursday announced new measures for fighting back against COVID-19 as positivity rates spike and fears grow surrounding the omicron variant. Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) during a news conference shared a six-pronged approach to combatting the rise. The new measures include the distribution of 1 million medical-grade KN95 masks and 500,000 rapid at-home tests to communities throughout the city, among others. De Blasio said city representatives will increase on-site inspections of area businesses to ensure compliance with vaccine and mask mandates. Additionally, New York will open five new testing sites and increase the number of mobile testing options, reports NY1.com. Pushing for booster shots is a priority as the shots remain the best way to protect yourself against the virus, said Dave Chokshi, city health commissioner. ""The facts are very clear,"" Chokshi said, according to NY1. ""Each new variant makes it more important to get vaccinated rather than less important."" New York is facing a surge in cases ahead of the holidays, fueled by omicron. Jay Varma, a top public health advisor to de Blasio, tweeted Thursday that the current spike in positive tests is unprecedented. ""Um, we've never seen this before in #NYC,"" Varma wrote. ""Test positivity doubling in three days."" Um, we've never seen this before in #NYC.

12/17/2021,"Ted Cruz just put out an ebook on how to fight Critical Race Theory in K-12 schools. The Texas senator says critical race theory concepts have ""infiltrated our education system."" He said to look out for ""buzzwords"" words like ""white privilege,"" ""systematic racism,"" and ""equity."" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is on a mission to ""defeat"" Critical Race Theory, the study of racial bias in US laws that he says is ""taking our schools by storm."" Though educators say CRT isn't taught in K-12 schools, Cruz argues the concepts have ""infiltrated our education system"" in a free, downloadable 10-page e-book exploring the origins of the college-level course, and alleging that it's tied to Marxism. ""Together, I think we can defeat Critical Race Theory in our schools and make sure that students learn the true history of America—the story of American greatness,"" Cruz says in the e-book. The e-book, based on Cruz's August 9 lecture at the conservative Leadership Institute's School Board Campaign Training, echoes complaints and talking points that other conservatives have used to fuel controversy over the topic. For example, Christopher Rufo, the Manhattan Institute fellow who started the political discussion about CRT in 2020 on Fox News, encouraged conservatives to use the term ""race-based Marxism"" in a CRT briefing book section on messaging called ""winning the language war."" Anyone trying to download the book must provide their email and will be met with a request for donations. ""Please give today to help train more conservatives to stop Critical Race Theory in its tracks,"" the request says. Cruz's e-book teaches conservatives how to ""spot CRT concepts"" in K-12 curricula by looking for ""buzzwords"" like ""white privilege,"" "" systemic racism"" and ""equity."" He focuses on ""equity,"" a word Merriam-Webster dictionary defines as ""fairness or justice in the way people are treated."" Cruz argues that CRT rejects equality and instead demands ""equity."" ""You see, to Critical Race theorists, in order to achieve equity, local and federal government policies must dis-criminate so that the same results are achieved by all races,"" Cruz writes. ""If policies don't meet that standard, CRT considers them racist policies."" The e-book, promoted through a sponsored tweet Wednesday by the Washington Times, was part of an 11-hour program the Leadership Institute sponsored in August to prepare conservatives to run for local school board seats ""against the entrenched left,"" according to a message that appears when you sign up to download the book. He participated in the program as school board races across the country were heating up over culture war issues in education, including the teaching of race. A study by Ballotpedia identified 272 school districts in 25 states where candidates took a stance on critical race theory, the role of race in curricula or specific equity and diversity plans, Covid-19 responses, and sex education or the use of gender-specific facilities. The most commonly cited issue was ""race in education/critical race theory,"" mentioned in 248 races, according to the study. Meanwhile, bills and laws to restrict discussion about race and gender in classrooms have cropped up in Republican-led states. Cruz, a Harvard-trained lawyer and former solicitor general of Texas, argues that CRT is based on a Marxist view of society as a conflict between oppressors and the oppressed. He adds that ""critiques of capitalism and property have been threads in the CRT quilt since the very beginning."" He links CRT to the New York Times Magazine's ""1619 Project,"" an accounting of US history with slavery's consequences and Black Americans' contributions to America at the center. Several school districts are teaching the 1619 project using curriculum guides from the Pulitzer Center.  Cruz also quotes from a document by the National Education Association, the nation's largest union representing both teachers and college faculty, that says they ""oppose attempts to ban critical race theory and/or The 1619 Project,"" they support an ""honest teaching of social studies,"" and that it's ""appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks"" that include CRT. NEA had no immediate comment. Cruz urged conservatives to stand up and fight, citing a case in Southlake, Texas, where he said conservative parents ""rallied together to defeat a ridiculous Critical Race Theory initiative that the local school district's diversity committee"" had put forth. ""The conservative parents were able to band together to fight this, and they got three times as many people to show up and vote in the school board elections than usually vote. And guess what—they won the school board elections about 70 to 30—a huge margin,"" Cruz wrote. ""That's what happens when we have grassroots leaders like you pushing back against Critical Race Theory."" Fordham University School of Law professor, Tanya Katerí Hernández, who has taught CRT for 25 years, described the topic to Insider as an analysis of legal jurisprudence that examines how advances in civil rights laws were undermined and have in many ways led to disenchantment with a colorblind approach to dealing with racism. People think ""it's part of an anti-whiteness mode of analysis or a racial hate platform,"" she said, adding that that's ""completely untrue."" But Morton Blackwell, Leadership Institute president, says in an email that accompanies the e-book that Cruz ""helps conservatives understand the ugly truth"" about CRT. ""Please share this e-book with other members of your family and community so they too can learn to spot Critical Race Theory concepts,"" he writes. ""As Senator Cruz makes clear, when conservatives stand up and act, we can defeat leftist indoctrination.""

12/17/2021,"Two Rottweilers that were attacking a jogger in St. Charles are dead after the dogs’ owner and a man with a concealed handgun tried unsuccessfully to pull the animals off the woman until the man with the gun fatally shot one of the dogs, according to the Kane County sheriff’s office. The homeowner voluntarily had the second Rottweiler euthanized the day after the attack earlier this week, according to Ron Hain, the Kane County sheriff. “It was a proactive stance by the dog owner, and I would say any responsible dog owner would do the same. I have four dogs and I think if any of them bit somebody we know that it would be the end of days for that dog,” Hain said Thursday. Hain said deputies were called to the 7N300 block of Windsor Drive about 9:15 a.m. Monday after getting a call that a 51-year-old woman had been jogging in the area when the two Rottweilers inexplicably began “using the woman like a chew toy,” Hain said. “One had her by the leg and the other had her by the scalp,” he said. “Doctors had to use six feet worth of sutures to repair her body.” The horrific attack began innocently enough, according to Hain. A Labradoodle made it past an electric fence and ran from its yard to where the woman was jogging “to greet her in the street,” officials said. The jogger and the homeowner were acquaintances and friendly with one another, so the woman stopped running, grabbed the Labradoodle by its collar and helped it back to its owner, who had been standing in her driveway watching the exchange. That’s when the two Rottweilers came bounding out of that home and started to attack the jogger, Hain said. “Something about the woman holding the dog by its collar and coming up their driveway was seen as some kind of aggression against the Labradoodle and the two Rottweilers were acting protectively, we think,” he said. The homeowner was trying to pull the dogs off the jogger when a man who has a license to carry a concealed weapon drove by, saw the commotion and got out of his vehicle to try to help pull the dogs off the jogger. But the man didn’t have a gun with him, Hain said. “So he called his father, who was maybe a block away, and asked him to get his gun and bring it to him, which he did. I believe he put it in his car and the man retrieved it,” Hain said. All the while, the dogs continued to attack the woman. “It went on for minutes, we don’t have an exact time frame. Once he had the weapon he shot the dog basically at point-blank range. He had to take appropriate action to save her life …,” Hain said. “And I believe he did.” Asked whether the woman was ever in any danger of being shot, Hain said the jogger was in a far more dangerous position without the man’s help. “That’s why he came back to point-blank range and why he fired through the side of the dog. If he had tried to shoot from a distance or into the dog’s head, that would’ve struck the woman, so he was very tactical about the way that he deployed his weapon,” Hain said. The noise from the single gunshot caused both dogs to retreat and the dog who was shot died “a short time later,” according to Hain. The 51-year-old was taken to Delnor Hospital and later flown by air ambulance to the trauma center at Good Samaritan Hospital. There she underwent emergency surgery and her condition has since been stabilized and her injuries are not considered to be life-threatening, according to Hain. The homeowner — the woman who owned the three dogs — also was taken to Delnor Hospital for treatment of injuries suffered while trying to stop the Rottweilers from attacking, authorities said. David Lombardo, an avid animal lover and the founder of Waterman-based Safer USA, a concealed carry instruction school, said the concealed carry holder was well within his rights to take action because a person can use lethal force if their life is in danger or the life of someone else is being threatened. “A dog, particularly a large dog, is perfectly capable of killing a human being,” Lombardo said. “If there’s anybody to blame, I suppose it’s the dog owner who should’ve had better control of her dogs, but this is an unfortunate situation all the way around.” Hain said the Kane County sheriff’s office continues to investigate. kdouglas@chicagotribune.com Twitter @312BreakingNews",U.S./Chicago Tribune,"Sheriff: 2 Rottweilers used jogger ‘like a chew toy’ before concealed carry holder stepped in, fatally shot 1 dog, 2nd euthanized after St. Charles attack",https://news.yahoo.com/rottweiler-attacks-woman-man-concealed-170400857.html
