12/24/2021,"Once a week at about 5.30am, Hayley Ashton pulls two masks over her face, sanitises a shopping trolley with her handbag disinfectant then takes a deep breath before stepping into the fluorescent glare of her local supermarket in Leicester. These grocery trips feel for Ashton, a 33-year-old project manager who is immunocompromised and has severe asthma, like treacherous expeditions where she risks serious illness or death. “It’s the one area you just can’t control,” she said.  In previous waves of Covid, Ashton was part of the government’s shielding schemes, which meant she had access to measures like statutory sick pay, medicine deliveries and priority shopping. Now, as the Omicron variant pushes cases to record levels, there’s no such protection. “A pint of milk could well cost me my life,” Ashton said. “And at the minute I’ve got no support from the government to get those essentials.” Ashton is one of almost 4 million clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people in England who were advised to shield by the government during previous Covid waves. Ashton said her clinician told her she would probably become seriously ill or die if she caught the virus, making the surge of Omicron a time of high anxiety and fear – made worse, she said, by ministers’ unwillingness to impose extra measures. In these circumstances, many CEV people are choosing to shield themselves – retreating into their homes, cancelling social engagements, avoiding public transport and sometimes even leaving frontline jobs to protect themselves. “Our world has shrunk back a lot,” said Sue Hardman, a retired 60-year-old in Suffolk with severe asthma. “You just feel forgotten … It’s almost as if there’s a group that doesn’t matter.” Ashton said she “felt supported” by the shielding programme earlier in the pandemic. But now she feels there is significant risk for those with underlying conditions. “What people are forgetting is for those in these vulnerable categories, even if [Omicron is] mild, the likelihood [or risk] is despite vaccines you are still going to become seriously ill.” For Zoe Pettigrew, a solicitor previously living in a shared flat in Bristol, the pandemic has meant isolating from friends since March 2020 with her family in Cornwall. Pettigrew, 33, who has Crohn’s disease which means taking immunosuppressive medication, feels “completely forgotten about” by the government. “It makes me so sad, but also angry,” she said. Pettigrew is yet to meet her three-month-old nephew. Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said last Wednesday the government is trying to avoid returning to the shielding programme given vaccines and new drugs – such as molnupiravir or Ronapreve – and the detrimental impact on mental health. “Shielding came with some very obvious downsides for the people involved in the shielding – including loneliness and mental health issues,” he said. A 2020 study found shielding led to a deterioration in mental health for about 35% of CEV people. “So it’s not an area we want to go down if there’s any way of avoiding doing so,” Whitty added. But for Pettigrew, this ignores the toll of feeling forced to shield but without the official acknowledgment of ministers. “It makes you feel like you’ve lost the plot,” she said. Without government support, “It’s like being under house arrest,” said Colin Talbot, 69, an emeritus professor at the University of Manchester who is immunocompromised. Some families, like Hardman’s, are cancelling Christmas plans. Her 28-year-old son is no longer visiting after being exposed to friends who tested positive. For others, it means leaving jobs they love. In Berwick-upon-Tweed, Rosie Purves, 36, has rheumatoid arthritis and is immunocompromised, meaning despite her three vaccine doses tests she shows a lack of Covid antibodies. This autumn, Purves left her job as a reception teacher over the risks posed by classroom infection and has received no financial or other support from the government. Purves urged ministers: “Please don’t forget about us.” Others have pulled their at-risk children out of schools, such as Laura Baines, a 44-year-old full-time carer to her CEV son, Louie, 15. “I’m struggling financially buying school supplies,” she said, urging safer measures in classrooms. National charities including Crohn’s and Colitis UK, the National Aids Trust and Kidney Care UK said the government must provide greater clarity and support for shielders. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it has published “a range of guidance for those previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable” and urged people to discuss “necessary precautions with their specialist” and to get the booster vaccine. Ashton is weighing up whether to spend Christmas alone or risk it with family. “It’s a really scary time,” she said.",News/World news,‘Please don’t forget us’: Covid shielders speak out over lack of government support,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/please-dont-forget-us-covid-shielders-speak-out-over-lack-of-government-support
12/24/2021,"A British man is missing in Afghanistan after a report he has been detained by the Taliban. Grant Bailey was arrested in the Afghan capital, Kabul, where he has been working as a security consultant. The arrest came during a Taliban security clampdown, according to the Daily Mirror.  The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office could not confirm his identity. But a spokesperson said: “We are aware of the detention of a British national in Afghanistan and have been in touch with their family to support them.” Bailey’s work duties include liaising with the US state department on security-related issues. He was last heard from on Saturday after being arrested at gunpoint, a UK security source told the Mirror. The Mirror quoted the source saying: “We were quite surprised he went back to Kabul after the western withdrawal as the security situation there is obviously much worse. “Added to that, the Taliban government is making it very difficult for the few ex-pats working there, making it very difficult to travel. A lot of people are trying to get to the bottom of what has happened to him, where he is being held, and under what charges.” Bailey is believed to have returned to Kabul in September just after the Taliban took over and the US and UK forces withdrew amid chaotic scenes at Kabul airport. His current employer has been contacted for comment. Bailey’s arrest underlines the continuing risks facing the small number of westerners who continue to work in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, hundreds of Afghans who worked for UK organisations, including the BBC, the British Council and UK forces, have been forced into hiding since the Taliban took over. Earlier this month, Joseph Seaton, the former British Council Afghanistan English manager, said of his former colleagues: “These people are living in constant fear of their lives. They were contracted under a British government-funded scheme to teach English teachers British values of diversity, inclusion and equality, the values that … the Taliban oppose. They were always told they were employees of the British government.” Since the Taliban’s takeover the UN has warned that 23 million Afghans face hunger due to conflict, drought and an economic downturn. In October the World Food Programme’s executive director, David Beasley, said: “Afghanistan is now among the world’s worst humanitarian crises – if not the worst – and food security has all but collapsed.”",News/World news,Briton missing in Afghanistan after reports of Taliban arrest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/briton-missing-in-afghanistan-after-reports-of-taliban-arrest
12/24/2021,"A kennel owner who died in a dog attack was a passionate animal welfare campaigner who worked tirelessly to give abused dogs another chance in life, his friends and colleagues have said. Adam Watts was killed at the Juniper kennels and cattery he ran in Kirkton of Auchterhouse, near Dundee, on Wednesday, by a dog it is understood police had previously seized and brought to him for rehabilitation.  Watts, 55, was pronounced dead at the scene after the attack, which was believed to have involved a large bulldog-type animal. The father of five wrote on the kennels’ Facebook page that his five sons assisted his work. It is believed his wife died of stomach cancer eight years ago at the age of 46. Police have said there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. Save Our Seized Dogs, a group dedicated to helping owners whose pets are seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, said Watts worked with police in Dundee. “Adam would take any dog to give them the chance of life and was the kennels of choice for the police in Dundee,” the group said on Facebook. “His gentle, calm nature soon gained the trust of some of the most abused dogs and they were able to go from him to find loving homes. “Adam died doing what he loved. He leaves behind five boys who he was the sole parent to. He talked of them often and was so proud of the older boys helping him with the dogs.” Juniper Kennels advertised itself as having 22 kennels of varying sizes, and eight catteries, with an enclosed exercise area to the rear where dogs could have a secure free run. It also offered leaded walks, one dog at a time. Wallace Vets, which has centres around Dundee, posted a tribute on its website, describing Watts as “the most caring man who went over and above in his passion for caring for animals, and worked tirelessly to help give some a loving future with a new family”. The Edinburgh-based dog training company SuperSmart Dog Training and Behaviour posted: “He was not just a kennel owner. He saved many dogs which he felt needed saving and would campaign for dogs’ welfare. All that met him found a caring, loving man who lived for his five boys and dogs. Since his wife died, this was his life [and he] put his heart and soul into saving dogs.”",News/UK news,Kennel owner dies after attack by rescue dog near Dundee,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/kennel-owner-dies-after-attack-by-rescue-dog-near-dundee
12/24/2021,"Who is the most important player in a football team? Is it the goalkeeper who stops the goals going in, or the forward who scores them? Or is it the midfielder who contributes to both? That debate has raged for more than 100 years and is unlikely to be solved in 800-odd words on this page but it is a pertinent question as we survey this year’s Guardian top 100 male footballers in 2021.  Once again a forward tops the list, Robert Lewandowski defending his crown from 2020 but with a smaller share of the vote. He is one of only four players to have won the award since its inception in 2012, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric being the other three. The Croat’s triumph in 2018 was the only time a non-forward has won the prize. This year Jorginho was in with a shout of becoming our fifth winner, having won both the Champions League and the European Championship during an outstanding year with Chelsea and Italy. I love a midfielder – especially if he or she is defensively astute – and put the Italian first on my list but in the end he could not compete with the goalscoring prowess of Lewandowski, Messi, Mohamed Salah and Karim Benzema and finished fifth. Jorginho is joined by two other midfielders in the top 10 – his Chelsea teammate N’Golo Kanté and Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne – but the whole list is dominated by forwards – 42 of the 100 play up front. Club-wise we have a shift at the top again, Manchester City replacing Liverpool with the most players on the list, having won the Premier League and reached the Champions League final. They have two more players on the list than the side that beat them at the Estádio do Dragão, Chelsea. Two clubs who have featured heavily in previous years, Barcelona and Juventus, drop out of the top five, mirroring the turbulent times they have had in 2021. Both have four players on the list – compare that with Barça’s four players in the top 15 in our first list in 2012 – and the Catalan side are rescued by the appearance of two youngsters, Gavi and Pedri, while Juve benefit from Italy’s win at Euro 2020 with Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci included. The delayed Euros and the Copa América bear a heavy influence on the standings when it comes to nationalities in the top 100. England and Italy are top with the Copa finalists Argentina and Brazil also among the top eight countries on the list. Germany’s poor showing at Euro 2020 is reflected in that they drop from 12 players (the most) in last year’s rankings to nine this time. Bayern’s failure to regain their Champions League crown doubtless played a part too with every player featured from the Bavarian club dropping down in position, except Lewandowski. Players from 30 countries received votes this year, Denmark having a record four players on the list after their Euro 2020 heroics and Senegal moving up to two with Édouard Mendy joining the top-100 regular Sadio Mané. The Premier League’s standing as the most powerful league in the world continues and, frankly, is reaching a somewhat disturbing level with 42 of the 100 players on the list coming from the English top flight. That is seven more than in 2020 and partly, of course, a reflection of the Champions League final’s all-English composition and England’s progress to the Euro 2020 showpiece. It is, nevertheless, a worrying trend as we want teams from as many countries as possible to challenge for the main continental prizes. This year we carried an interview with the Bayer Leverkusen CEO, Fernando Carro, who expressed his concern over the Premier League’s dominant position saying his club, regularly in the top five of the Bundesliga, lost out on a player in the summer because they could not compete financially with a promoted team from England. “At the end of the day you can make money from transfers,” he said. “English clubs pay the transfers, we get the money, but then that just means the entire Bundesliga is like a development league for the Premier League. “Even Borussia Dortmund have to sell players to the Premier League. The only club that can compete at the moment from the Bundesliga is Bayern Munich.” La Liga is still the second highest league but down two players from 2020. It does have, in Gavi, the youngest player ever to appear on the list, at the age of 17, beating Gianluigi Donnarumma by a few months from when the Italian made his debut on the list in 2016. At the other end of the spectrum Zlatan Ibrahimovic appears on the list for a ninth time despite having turned 40 in October. Every year it feels harsh not to mention the unlucky players who finished just outside the top 100. In 2021 Alexander Isak was particularly unfortunate having featured on 25 voting slips, yet finished a mere three points behind the 100th-placed Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Theo Hernández, Andy Robertson, Kalvin Phillips and Pau Torres were also very close to making the list. An impressive 325 players had at least one vote this year, showcasing the vast array of talent on display around the world.",Sport/Football,Jorginho misses out on top spot despite Chelsea and Italy triumphs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/24/jorginho-misses-out-on-top-spot-despite-chelsea-and-italy-triumphs
12/24/2021,"Around about this time last year, a few sips into one of the drinks that are the subject of this column it occurred to me that the best Christmas nighttime drinking is all about wood. Most of the drinks I turn to as a calmer mood takes over from the jangly, tinselly brightness of Christmas Day have benefited from mastery of the mellowing effects of ageing alcohol, for various lengths of time, in oak barrels of various sizes.  In Portugal’s Douro valley, port producers perform an annual experiment, making two very different styles from the same sweet, red fortified wine. Vintage port will go into a bottle after a couple of years in oak vats, retaining its inky purple colour and dark fruit when sold. Tawny ports, by contrast, stay in vat for years longer, even for several decades in the case of the flurry of very rare collectors’ tawnies that have emerged in recent years (such as the extraordinary, €895 a bottle 1934 Dalva I was lucky enough to try a small sample of recently). The effects of oxygenation are more advanced in porous barrels than they are in bottles, in which only a small amount of oxygen, passing through the cork, is in contact with the liquid. It’s that process which brings the special cast of flavours to tawny ports: the nuts, the dried fruits, the treacle and caramel, and dark baking spices, as well as the colour that gives the style its name. Colheita ports are relatively rare; most tawny ports are blends of vats of differing ages with an average age statement rounded up to a decade (10-year-old, 20-year-old etc). These rely even more on the chef-like skill and librarian’s memory of a master blender – the same abilities that bring magic to blended, oak-aged drinks such as whisky, rum, cognac and very old sherry. In all of those drinks the taste isn’t only wood. Character and quality depends equally on the raw materials, the length of time they spend in wood and the way they interact with it: its flavours (American oak tends to deliver sweeter, more coconut flavours than the toastier aromas of French) and the oxygenating effects it allows. The suave, golden harmony of great grape-borne cognac; the molasses-richness of dark rum; the peppery iodine-wildness of Islay whisky made from peaty malted barley; the salted nut savouriness of very old sherry … the string of relaxed dark nights between Christmas and new year seems to me the perfect time to sit, sip and explore this world within a world. Taste the Difference Oloroso Sherry(£8, 50cl, Sainsbury’s)The range of sherry made for Sainsbury’s by Lustau has long been one of the highlights of the Taste the Difference range. The oloroso has a touch of sweetness but is intensely flavoured with tangy dried citrus and nutty length and great with a slab of manchego. Warre’s Colheita Port 2009(£17, thewinesociety.com)This superb-value colheita (a tawny port from a single harvest) from venerable port shipper Warre’s has been bottled at a beautiful point on the continuum between ruby youth and tawny age. The result is all Christmassy dried dates and nuts, and a hint of brambly jam. Villa de Varda Amaretto(£26.95, independent.wine)Not a product of wood-ageing, but a drink that is very much of the woods, a sweet but gloriously complex amaretto that is very far from the mass market norm thanks to its high-definition capture of the scents and flavours of almonds foraged in the forests of Alpine Trentino. Hine Rare VSOP Cognac(from £43.90, thewhiskyexchange.com; waitrosecellar.com)The flagship VSOP cognac from one of the region’s grand old names, Hine’s Rare gets its seductive silkiness and aromatic fineness from a combination of top-notch grapes from more than 20 of the region’s best crus, plus an average of eight years’ rest in French oak barrels. Gosling’s Family Reserve Old Rum(£60, Waitrose)A molasses-based, 150-year-old family secret recipe is the base of this luxuriously rich old rum from Bermuda. The components have spent 16-19 years in charred oak barrels, and the result has a liquorice-toffee dark depth, a crackle of spice and a beguiling softness. Laphroaig 10 Year Old Cask Strength Batch 012 Bottled 2020(£89.95, thewhiskyexchange.com)The standard 10 Year Old Laphroaig (from £30) is one of my failsafe single malt choices, but this special cask strength bottling is another level of evocative wild Islay magic: an extra-concentrated version of the classic Laphroaig mix of heather-honeyed smoothness and smoke-and-sea-spray pungency.",Lifestyle/Food,"Port, sherry, whisky - Christmas drinks are all about the wood",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/24/port-sherry-whisky-christmas-drinks-are-all-about-the-wood
12/24/2021,"Last week, while the media were preoccupied with Downing Street parties, an election took place in parliament in which every sitting MP had a vote. The purpose was to fill the post vacated by Yvette Cooper’s elevation to the shadow cabinet: chair of the home affairs select committee. It’s a powerful position: the winner can subpoena witnesses, make statements to the house and issue reports and recommendations on some of the biggest issues of the day. All the chairs of parliament’s 30 key committees serve as members of the liaison committee and get to grill the prime minister regularly at close quarters. Follow-up questions are allowed, unlike at prime minister’s questions, where slots are drawn out of a hat with very poor odds. Chairships are divvied up between the big two parties in proportion to how many MPs each has, so this was a guaranteed Labour post.  Despite the universal acknowledgment that we need a parliament that reflects wider society, backed up with strategies and policies to achieve it, there is a glaring omission in this vital element of our democracy: not a single one of the current 30 committee chairs is black or from a minority ethnic background. I tried to change that. I failed. Before becoming an MP in 2015 I was an academic and sociologist, writing books on drugs and riots. In my first parliament I was Labour’s home affairs spokesperson and a shadow minister, so I reckoned I was suitably qualified. Others who’d trodden the same path before, unsuccessfully, warned me of the awkward conversations these elections entail: the sucking up to Tories for votes, the fierce competition with others in your own party. Nonetheless I went for it – how bad could it be? In the end Dame Diana Johnson, the continuity candidate from the committee, won. My 132 votes garnered to her 154 placed me second of three candidates. I’m delighted for her and know she’ll be great. But the experience confirmed many things I’d been warned of. In 2020, my friend and fellow London BAME MP Kate Osamor, who ran for the international development committee, crunched the figures. LGBT and disability are represented among committee chairs, she found, with women catching up, but black and minority ethnic representation lagged seriously behind. As she points out, BAME candidates all too often don’t get taken seriously. As it is the media tend to mix us up: I’ve been captioned as Tulip Siddiq by the BBC. The same has happened to Dawn Butler and Marsha de Cordova, and others. In this case, media coverage described me as “considering a tilt” rather than being a serious contender. That has its effect; possible candidates don’t stand because they fear how they will be perceived. And thus we see an eerie repeat of the underestimation/underachievement loop that means BAME footballers struggle to become managers, black lawyers struggle to make partner, and black police officers rarely rise to the rank of chief constable. This matters because, unlike the weekly pantomime of the chamber and PMQs, select committees do have the ability to hold the powerful to account on the nation’s behalf, and have a record of actually doing so. Remember beleaguered Rupert Murdoch’s appearance amid the hacking scandal, the discomforting of Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley over his company’s working practices, and the spectacle of Dominic Cummings likening Boris Johnson to a shopping trolley careering around with no direction – an epithet that stuck. But there is weakness in homogeneity. During the digital, culture, media and sport select committee’s inquiry into the racism in cricket scandal, it was remarked that none of the admirable MPs involved in cross-examination had any first-hand experience of the racism being discussed. To have a committee chair who could identify with how it feels to be racially abused, to be called a “Paki”, might have sent out a powerful signal. I hope things will change, but I can’t help but notice that of the three committees I’ve served on, justice, public administration and Brexit, the chairs have been either knighted or the offspring of MPs – or, in the case of Sir Bernard Jenkin, both. This feels like a replicating pattern. And while there has undoubtedly been progress in diversity – on both sides of the house – since 1987, when my ex-boss Diane Abbott first took up her seat alongside Keith Vaz, Bernie Grant and Paul Boateng, progression in key aspects of parliamentary life – the roles that shape how the executive does its job – seems to have stalled. At this rate, for example, will we ever see a person of colour in the Speaker’s chair, refereeing proceedings? I may not have got the chairship but the experience was salutary, and this is not about me as an individual. Surely the concern for every MP must be how it appears that no one who looks anything like me tends to get there. The one exception was Keith Vaz who was forced, amid scandal, to resign in 2016. We need more MPs to vote in these elections – less than half of those eligible did this time – and for them to see a broader picture when they do. In parliament’s shop window, we have the most diverse house ever with Priti Patel, Rishi Sunak, Kwasi Kwarteng and Sajid Javid in powerful public roles, but in committee-land, where important stuff happens without the Punch and Judy style spectacle, it’s still “hideously white” (as Greg Dyke once described the BBC).

12/24/2021,"What can be said of a world where one billionaire wants to build a giant tulip-shaped tower of little practical use and another wants to house thousands of students in windowless rooms in a block with all the charm of an Amazon distribution centre? The first, designed by Foster + Partners for the Brazilian Jacob Safra, was supposed somehow to boost confidence in the City of London by building what would have been only the world’s second highest flower-themed absurdity, a taller Lotus Tower having already been built in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The second, Munger Hall, is the dormitory for the University of California, Santa Barbara, where in return for donating $200m of the $1.5bn cost the 97-year-old Charlie Munger is insisting that 94% of residents have no natural light in their rooms. At least the British government saw sense and refused the Tulip planning permission, whereas plans are still proceeding for Munger Hall. Both projects seem driven by ego, but in the wide space between the brutal functionalism of the latter and the redundant gesturing of the former you might hope to find places where beauty is put in the service of the usual and unusual needs of human life. My top five, I submit, achieve this.  In climate emergency news, there was a bit of a fad this year for temporarily relocating trees in places where you don’t usually find them – in the courtyard of Somerset House, out the back of Tate Modern, on a “mound” at Marble Arch. The idea was to say something or other about the importance of having nature in cities, but any suspicion that these projects were, like the Tulip, a teeny bit gestural was resoundingly confirmed by the contrast between the lush landscape that publicity images promised for the mound and the bedraggled reality. More usefully and less glamorously, it continues to sink into public and official consciousness that it’s environmentally good to refit buildings where possible rather than rebuild them – that there’s little point in sinking huge carbon and energy costs in a building that might give some payback in a few decades’ time. Progress was also made with the technology of building large structures with timber – by no means a cure-all for issues of sustainability but a step in the right direction. The boggling horrors of the Grenfell Tower inquiry continue to unfold. Stories keep coming out of failures by manufacturers, regulators, contractors and consultants to stop the building being wrapped in materials that easily caught fire. Questions are now being asked about the effect of the coalition government’s attempts to deregulate construction – as David Cameron put it at the time, to “kill off the health and safety culture for good”. There were losses to the world of architecture and design: Zeev Aram, the architect and retailer who did much to popularise the work of Eileen Gray; Chris Wilkinson, whose elegant high-tech structures included the Gateshead Millennium Bridge; Virgil Abloh, who took his architectural training into fashion design; the brutalist maestro Owen Luder.

The league’s board rejected an initial postponement request from Everton but accepted on Friday morning that the game could not take place because of the impact of Covid and injuries on Benítez’s squad.  It is the third match of the Premier League’s Boxing Day programme to be cancelled, after Liverpool v Leeds and Wolves v Watford. The league said it had “regrettably approved” the postponement. “The board reviewed the club’s request today to postpone the match following further injuries to their squad,” it said. “They concluded that the club will not be able to fulfil their fixture this weekend as a result of an insufficient number of players available to play due to Covid-19 cases and injuries.” Benítez said on Thursday that Everton had only nine outfield players available and would have to bring in five youngsters deemed by the league as having enough experience to play.

12/24/2021,"It is remarkable – not to mention impressive – that, given all the turmoil of 2021, we were treated to such a terrific year of culture. As with 2020, there was endless innovation shown in every art form, as performers found ways to create within the restrictions placed on them. The difference this year was that, alongside lockdown-devised albums, remote theatre performances and the like, we were also treated to the hefty backlog of films and TV shows originally intended for the year before, from No Time to Die to season three of Succession. And, for a while at least, there was the return of full-throated live performance, from West End shows to music festivals.  In this week’s newsletter we’re highlighting some of the best culture from 2021, chosen both by me and by you. There are no rankings here; the Guardian has already done that pretty extensively across film, music, TV, games, stage and art. Instead, it is more of a celebration of the great culture that you probably caught (Dune, It’s a Sin) and those gems you almost certainly missed (unearthed recordings from the birth of 80s Chicago house). Thank you for all your great recommendations, and I hope you have a very merry Christmas. The Guide’s picks For gargantuan big-screen spectacle at a time when the future of the cinema itself was being questioned, it is hard to look past Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. Right at the other end of the scale, was the hilarious and cringe-inducing low-budget comedy Shiva Baby. Its lead, Rachel Sennott, is a superstar in waiting. Pablo Larraín’s psychological horror-comedy Spencer was the year’s most audacious and divisive film, a Sandringham-set Rosemary’s Baby with Kristen Stewart’s Princess Diana in the Mia Farrow role. And on the documentary front, two very different films leaped out: MLK/FBI’s gasp-inducing uncovered history of institutional skullduggery, and Questlove’s joyous 1969 concert film Summer of Soul (... Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised). Reader picks Best film of the year for me is The Power of the Dog. Loved the cinematography and the slow pace, and the acting was brilliant. It’s a film I’d watch again to catch the subtleties. Jane Campion is a superb director, kudos to her. Suzanne Gauthier Must see: Coda! Would return to the theatre for that one, again and again. CG I thought Minari was splendid: beautiful, original, moving and hilarious. Excellent acting as well. What more could you want? Yvonne Durie [Further reading: Minari star Steven Yeun spoke about the film as well as his love of the great Bong Joon-ho, in an interview earlier this year] My favourite film was Another Round, which I’m sure will get lots of votes! Karen Beesley The Guide’s picks Surely 2021’s most gorgeously produced album, the daring, bracing, vast-sounding Sometimes I Might Be Introvert saw north London rapper Little Simz deliver on a decade’s worth of promise. Shame’s taut and propulsive Drunk Tank Pink was my favourite of the many British post-punk/noise-rock albums that landed in 2021 (although Black Midi’s John L remains the most thrillingly out-there track I heard this year). Promises – Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra’s lovely ambient-electronica-jazz hybrid – was perfect aural escapism in a frenetic year. And for pure jangly catchiness, it is hard to look past the Canadian outfit Kiwi Jr’s Cooler Returns, positioned perfectly between the Strokes, Parquet Courts and Pavement. Reader picks The Solution Is Restless by Joan as Police Woman, Tony Allen and Dave Okumu. Created music, not simply constructed. Niall O’Donnell Under the Conditions by LeRon Carson. Not sure if this really counts as new since Carson died in 2016, but a lot of these tunes are previously unreleased, made at the birth of house music in Chicago on the lowest of lo-fi equipment. This is amazing stuff, up there with Virgo, Mr Fingers & co, back at the start of Trax, DJ International, Underground, Mitchbal and all the other seminal labels. Mike Firth Pressure Machine by the Killers. Rosa Bartlett [Hailed by the Observer as their best album in years] Cleo Sol took over from Max Richter for my own personal lullaby. Maggie Chute [Further reading: as well as her own soothing soul-jazz, Cleo Sol also found time to make yet another album with the prolific collective Sault, which found its way on to the Guardian’s best of 2021 list] Isles by Bicep got me through lockdown. Suzanne Stockton The Guide’s picks Although I am still not convinced it quite stuck the landing, Russell T Davies’s deeply affecting Aids drama It’s a Sin is the show that stayed with me the longest this year. The ridiculously consistent Succession has to be mentioned in any end-of-year sum-up, while the pitch-black satire of The White Lotus more than deserved its sleeper-hit status. It was a great year for small-screen documentaries: the Beeb’s policy of just letting Adam Curtis crack on with things bore fruit with his most ambitious series yet, Can’t Get You Out of My Head, while Steve McQueen’s doc about the 1981 fire in New Cross, south London, Uprising, served as a sobering postscript to his drama series Small Axe. And two British comedies – Jamie Demetriou’s fantastically daft Stath Lets Flats and Liam Williams’s note-perfect coming-of-age series Ladhood – returned with new outings that somehow improved on what had come before. Reader picks I learned about the Netflix series Somos from the Guardian. It’s about a Mexican town that is slowly taken over by drug traffickers, and it’s brilliantly done. Lives are upturned and destroyed by a wrong turn, a misplaced word, an unintended glance. It’s terrifying, tragic, subtle and with some superbly subdued performances from mostly unknown actors. A worthy addition to the year’s best. Andrew Downie The best series, without doubt, and not just because I live in Bristol was Stephen Merchant’s The Outlaws. Great cast, great writing, funny, serious, political and riveting. Josephine Eliot [Further reading: earlier this year, Stephen spoke to our magazine Saturday about his “low rent western” The Outlaws, and also walking through a plateglass window at a party hosted by Sarah Silverman] There was a recent spate of very good BBC dramas running in four-to-six parts. Showtrial was first class. Sheelah Kehoe Unforgotten’s Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar are the best double act on TV – bar none. Continuing the Nicola Walker theme, a shout for Annika – a quirky police procedural shown on Alibi, set in Scotland with her as the eponymous detective inspector. She breaks the fourth wall constantly, drives a boat to work, and references Viking words and customs to make sense of the plot. Completely oddball, but rather charming. Rob Mansfield I loved The White Lotus, and of course Succession! Elaine Dunlap Time by Jimmy McGovern, starring Stephen Graham and Sean Bean. Amazing story and acting from this impressive duo. Louise Carr The Guide’s picks At a time where podcasts have somewhat lost that buzzy, blockbuster quality, Tortoise’s addictive catfishing investigation Sweet Bobby was an exception, harking back to the glory days of pods such as Serial. The film-maker Adam McKay hosted the engrossing Death at the Wing, which recounted the tragic deaths of high-profile basketball players in the 80s through the prism of Reaganism, while Karina Longworth’s old Hollywood podcast You Must Remember This had a particularly great season on Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. My favourite of the “people amiably chatting” genre this year was film pod The Big Picture, which seems to have come into its own in lockdown, with its lively “movie draft” episodes, director top fives and zingy back and forths from hosts Sean Fennessey and Amanda Dobbins. Reader picks World Service’s Deeply Human. Great presenter and subject. Maggie Chute Sweet Bobby came late in the year, but was a fantastic listen. The mic-drop moment in episode three was worth it alone. It’s been left tantalisingly open for a follow-up, but I was left counting down the days between episodes. Rob Mansfield [Further reading: the Observer’s Miranda Sawyer was just as hooked by Sweet Bobby] I like boring history podcasts, so it’s Rex Factor. Suzanne Stockton The Guide’s picks The Guardian’s books of the year list is an absolute monster this year, covering everything from Sally Rooney’s Beautiful World, Where Are You to Warren Ellis’s imaginative music biography, Nina Simone’s Gum. You can explore the whole thing here, helpfully divided into categories from politics to food. Meanwhile, the Observer has handed its books of the year list over to the experts, with authors ranging from Bernadine Evaristo to Kazuo Ishiguro highlighting their favourites from 2021. Reader picks Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman. To call this a book about time management is a whopping understatement and a major injustice. It gets to the heart of our existence and what, individually, our place here is – it’s part self-help, but a bigger part life philosophy. I defy you not to find something in here that will make you reassess the way you live your life. Rob Mansfield Civilisations by Laurent Binet, translated by Sam Taylor. Mary Bailey[This does sound fascinating: a counter-factual novel imagining what would have happened if the Incas had settled in Europe] My favourite book published this year was A Bright Ray of Darkness by Ethan Hawke. Karen Beesley [Further reading: we interviewed Ethan for his first novel in 20 years, as well as his unlikely love of Doris Kearns Goodwin] If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter please subscribe to receive The Guide in your inbox every Friday.",Arts/Culture,The Guide #14: readers pick 2021’s best culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/24/the-guide-best-films-tv-books-albums-podcasts-2021
