1/30/2022,"Anthony Albanese has accused the federal government of failing to understand how badly small businesses are hurting during the Omicron wave, as the Coalition resists calls to provide extra economic support. The Labor leader said businesses were suffering from a “void of national leadership” after the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, declared the government could not say yes “every time someone turns up and says I want money”.  The New South Wales Coalition government announced on Sunday it would roll out a $1bn economic support package to help small- and medium-size businesses, but the payment will be capped at half of what was offered during the Delta wave. The state treasurer, Matt Kean, said he was “very disappointed” that the federal government had declined to pour in funding. “In their absence we’re having to step up to the plate and do our bit to preserve those businesses and help our national economy,” Kean told the Nine Network on Sunday. Joyce said the federal government had “paid billions and billions and billions of dollars out” for pandemic-related programs including jobseeker, jobkeeper, stimulus to the airline industry and “it goes on and on and on”. “So I don’t think it’s penny pinching,” Joyce told Sky News on Sunday. Asked whether $1bn was a drop in the ocean, especially with an election looming by May this year, Joyce said: “Drops in the ocean all add up.” The deputy prime minister argued the government could not “keep putting things on the credit card” and had to make “hard decisions”. “You’ve got to get to a point where you say, well, we’re going to live with this [virus] and we’ve got to move on because the more we pay out on Omicron and Covid campaigns is less money for NDIS, less money for defence, less money for education, less money for health,” Joyce said. But Albanese said the federal government was leaving business behind. “One of the things you notice around any shopping centre in the country is the number of empty shopfronts and business is really doing it tough,” Albanese told the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday. “You’ve had consumer confidence in decline. You’ve had people essentially imposing their own restrictions on their activity and that’s really hurting small business.” Pressed on whether businesses should be getting more federal support now, Albanese said: “I would like to see, where the conditions are there that were the same for giving support before, why is it that this support has been completely withdrawn?” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has argued Australia is “transitioning to a new phase of our pandemic response”. “Even though spending has come off a little bit as a result of Omicron and the challenges that business face, we’ve actually seen credit card spending in aggregate terms, 19% higher right now through January than what we saw during the Delta period,” Frydenberg told reporters on Friday. “Aggregate credit card spending data is still 25% higher today than what we saw in the equivalent period back in 2019.” But Albanese dismissed that argument, saying that is “because people are buying things online”. “It says it all about the treasurer and how out of touch he is, the fact that he doesn’t seem to understand how tough small business is do doing at the moment,” Albanese said. Albanese said Labor’s pledge to provide free rapid antigen tests would be subject to “limits based upon the health advice”. That could include a cap on the number of tests a person could receive each month, in order to “control supply”. “What you’ve had from this government is a ‘let it rip’ approach when it comes to the market delivering and the market hasn’t delivered.” The Labor party released a new policy on Sunday to increase Australia’s sovereign manufacturing capacity in medical essentials including testing equipment, masks, personal protective equipment and ventilators. The party is pledging to “give first priority to Australian-made medical technology for government purchases in consumables and equipment”. It also says it would instruct Labor’s promised $15bn National Reconstruction Fund “to make medical technology a top priority and work with the A Future Made in Australia Office to develop a national investment plan for healthcare essentials”. Albanese said Australia needed immediate supply “so some of that will obviously need to be overseas purchase”. “But the truth is that there’s one company in Brisbane that’s currently exporting 100,000 tests a day to the United States,” he said, referring to Ellume. “And they wanted to establish a manufacturing facility, they wanted to ramp it up here. They approached the federal government and the federal government wasn’t interested but the US government was.” When the Insiders host David Speers pointed to the fact that certain batches of Ellume’s Covid-19 home test kits had been recalled by the Food and Drug Administration in the US because of “higher-than-acceptable false positive test results”, Albanese said it was important to respect regulatory processes. “But the point here is, David, we need to manufacture rapid antigen tests here. One of the lessons of this pandemic is that we need to be more self-reliant.” Albanese also indicated that a Labor government would increase funding for aged care, without committing to specific amounts. Albanese pointed to the ongoing wage case before the Fair Work Commission, in which aged care providers and unions have quietly reached consensus on the increased complexity and value of aged care work, but potential pay rises are yet to be decided. “The federal government should be making a submission to the commission supporting an increase in wages,” Albanese said. The Health Services Union – which is seeking a 25% wage increase for aged care – welcomed Albanese’s “hugely significant” comments. “In the short term it will lift the spirits of aged care workers,” the HSU national president, Gerard Hayes, said. “But in the longer term we need to lift wages to allow more workers to stay in the industry and stem the short staffing crisis.”",News/Business,Anthony Albanese accuses Morrison government of leaving business behind during Omicron wave,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/anthony-albanese-accuses-morrison-government-of-leaving-business-behind-during-omicron-wave
1/30/2022,"New South Wales has recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic so far, reporting 52 deaths from Covid in the last 24 hours. It comes as the state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, confirmed four cases of the new Omicron subvariant, described as “son of Omicron”, saying there is “likely to be more”.  “This is a sublineage, a sort of breakaway from the Omicron variant. We know that it is circulating in countries and we have seen it grow significantly,” she said. “At the moment we don’t see that it is presenting anything different clinically in terms of the severity or its response to vaccine but we’ll obviously be watchful, monitor the situation closely.” Chant said the new variant contains the “S gene” that characterised the Omicron variant, but said “special genomic sequencing” was required to “get a handle on its distribution.” NSW reported 13,524 new cases, with a total of 2,663 hospitalisations, of which 182 are in ICU. Of the 52 deaths, 33 were men and 19 were women. One person was over 100, 11 were in their 90s, 26 were in their 80s, 11 were in their 70s and three were in their 60s. Thirty-one of the people that died were aged care residents, with only two of them having received booster shots. “On behalf of everybody across our state, can I extend our condolences to the families, our thoughts and prayers, our hearts are with you today and over this difficult time,” the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said. Chant said NSW Health was also changing its reporting period, changing its cut-off time from 8pm to 4pm, to allow epidemiologists, surveillance officers and data analysts to shift to “more sustainable footing.” “This will also allow them to focus on some additional work in epidemiology reports and provide more granular detail that will support the community as we move forward with our Covid response,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Perrottet urged people to get their booster vaccine dose, noting that only about 40% of the eligible population had received their third jab so far. The premier told Sky News he expected the number of Covid deaths to “remain stable” and that NSW should prepare for “a difficult fly season”. “We expect those [death] numbers to stay pretty consistent,” he said. “This is the new world.” Perrottet unveiled a $1bn support package for small businesses and landlords who have been affected by the state’s skyrocketing case numbers. The support package includes payment of 20% of weekly payroll costs to companies that can prove a decline in turnover of at least 40% across January, and an extension of the commercial landlord hardship grant, which supports landlords providing rental relief to tenants affected by downturns. It also included an increase to the small business fees and charges rebate, with the treasurer, Matt Kean, saying the government would also cover 50% of the costs of rapid antigen tests. “This is to help our small business sector to get through the other side so they can support the economy. “Money will come online by March to ensure that we don’t put additional pressure on the supply of rapid antigen tests in the market. “It will come online at a time when there are enough rapid antigen test to ensure they are affordable and accessible to everyone in the community.” In Victoria, 20 deaths and 10,589 new cases were recorded. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said the booster shot may soon be considered as important as the earlier two jabs. “I think it’s only a matter of time before the relevant federal agencies confirm that this is three doses, but it is not two plus a bonus. “It really is three doses to be protected not just against really critical illness, but to be protected or minimise the likelihood that you get it and give to the people that you love.” Andrews noted that the seven-day case number average had been dropping in Victoria, from “nearly 19,000” last week to 12,659 this week. “We are seeing that positive trend, and a more optimistic picture than even our modelling predicted,” he said. “You can see a very significant reduction in the number of people in the community that have Covid.” There are now 889 people in hospital with Covid in Victoria, with 111 in intensive care and 35 on ventilators. Tasmania reported one death on Sunday and 594 new cases, while South Australia reported two deaths and 1,633 new cases.",News/Australia news,NSW reports 52 Covid deaths in deadliest day of pandemic to date as ‘son of Omicron’ variant cases emerge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/nsw-reports-52-covid-deaths-in-deadliest-day-of-pandemic-to-date-as-son-of-omicron-variant-cases-emerge
