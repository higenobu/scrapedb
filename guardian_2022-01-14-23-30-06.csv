It is not an allegory, a reference to myth or any other kind of symbol – as Renaissance art is so often assumed to contain – but just an act of observation. The artist looks clearly and carefully at a hunting bird on its perch. He captures its bright, fierce eye and tiger-striped breast feathers, the leather bracelets on its feet and bell to sound the alert if it takes flight. It waits alertly against an undecorated, meaning-free wall. This is an art of describing of the sort we associate with northern European rather than Italian painters. In fact, Jacopo de’ Barbari moved between north and south, working in Nuremberg as well as Venice. His sparrowhawk anticipates by about 150 years The Goldfinch, the painting by Carel Fabritius made famous by Donna Tartt’s novel. It’s a memorial to a nameless bird of prey that lived half a millennium ago. National Gallery, London To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

1/14/2022,"About one in 10 people in north-west England had Covid last week, data has revealed, while infection levels have risen in those aged 50 and over. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, the Omicron wave has continued to sweep the UK.  Infection levels appear to have peaked in London, falling from one in 10 at the end of 2021 to one in 15 in the week ending 6 January, but they have risen in all other regions of England except the east. The north-west recorded the highest levels. The ONS estimated that 3,735,000 people – or about 1 in 15 – in England had Covid during the week, while the figure for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was around one in 20. The study also reveals that while there was no clear rise in infection levels in those under the age of 50, the percentage testing positive for Covid remained highest for older teenagers and young adults, at around one in 10 of those in school year 12 to age 34. There was an increase, however, among those aged 50 and over testing positive, at around one in 20 of those aged 50 to 69 and one in 30 of those aged 70. That compares with around one in 25 and one in 45 respectively the previous week. The rise in older age groups is of particular concern given age is a risk factor for more severe Covid. Vaccine uptake in these age groups has been high, but many received their boosters early, meaning their immunity may since have waned to some degree. As a result it remains uncertain what the impact of high levels of infection may have on older adults, and – as a result – healthcare services. According to official case data – which is based on infections among those who chose to come forward for testing – the number of new cases a day is falling in the UK, with 109,133 new cases reported on Wednesday, down from a his of more than 218,000 earlier in the month. As experts have previously noted, however, the ONS data covers a slightly earlier period of time, and picks up both new and ongoing infections, as well as those without symptoms. Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey, said Omicron continued to be the dominant variant while Delta declined. “Infections in the under 50s are increasing more slowly than in recent weeks, while infections in the over 50s have been increasing more rapidly,” she said. “It’s important to note that older age groups still remain the lowest infected and we will continue to monitor the data closely to see how this changes.”",News/World news,"One in 10 people in north-west England had Covid last week, ONS says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/one-in-10-people-in-north-west-england-had-covid-last-week-ons-says
1/14/2022,"Arsenal and the Premier League are in discussions regarding whether Sunday’s north London derby will go ahead, with Mikel Arteta’s side heavily affected by injuries and Covid-19. At least 12 players could be unavailable for the match at Tottenham and, with the league’s rules stating a game can be called off if a team are unable to field 13 outfield players and a goalkeeper, Arsenal are investigating whether they will be able to request a postponement.  Arsenal went into Thursday night’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool with eight first-teamers, four of whom are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, absent but their concerns have increased since then. Granit Xhaka will be suspended and Cédric Soares and Bukayo Saka picked up knocks at Anfield. Martin Ødegaard was the only senior player known to be absent with coronavirus and the Premier League’s stance may be determined by the results of Covid-19 testing carried out at the club on Friday.

1/14/2022,"Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said there was “a deal to be done” over the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland after “constructive talks” with her EU counterpart raised hopes of less rancorous relations with Brussels. The notably sunny prognosis followed a first meeting with Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner responsible for Brexit issues, at Chevening, the cabinet minister’s official country residence in Kent.  In a joint EU-UK statement, a rarity in recent years, Truss and Šefčovič said intensive talks would begin next week to deal with the outstanding issues relating to Northern Ireland’s place within both the EU and UK’s internal market. “We’ve had constructive talks with the EU,” Truss said in a later interview with the BBC. “We’re now going to go into intensive negotiations to work towards a negotiated solution to sort out these very real issues for the people of Northern Ireland.” The foreign secretary played down the previous threats of triggering article 16 of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, under which the UK would suspend parts of the deal previously agreed with the EU. She said: “What I want is a negotiated solution. I think there is a deal to be done. We have had constructive talks over the last day. “Of course there is more work to do, and that is why we are intensifying the discussions. I will be seeing the vice-president again in a week’s time, and I do want to make progress. Clearly if we don’t make sufficient progress we will have to look at the alternatives, but my absolute desire is to get a deal that works for the people of Northern Ireland.” The attempt to build strong personal relations with Šefčovič at Chevening, where the two politicians walked around the estate and dined on Scottish smoked salmon, Welsh lamb and apple pie, offered a clear sign that the government is seeking to reset relations after the resignation of Lord Frost, who often clashed with his opposing numbers in Brussels. Major differences remain between the sides over the future implementation of the protocol, which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods and draws a customs border down the Irish sea. The EU has offered to cut in half the number of customs checks and reduce health and safety checks on meat, plant and dairy products by 80%. The UK is insistent that the plans proposed do not yet live up to that promise and is pushing for a more radical overhaul that would ensure there are no checks on goods from Great Britain destined to stay in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, which leads Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive, has demanded a timeline for enforcing the UK’s protocol demands. Northern Ireland goes to the polls in May and there is an expectation that the two sides will seek to strike a deal ahead of that election. Ireland’s foreign secretary, Simon Coveney, welcomed the improved mood music around the talks. He said: “I think it is a good thing that the Brexit issues and the protocol issues are back in the Foreign Office in London rather than in a separate unit led by Lord Frost.”",News/UK news,"Brexit: there’s ‘a deal to be done’ over Northern Ireland, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/brexit-deal-northern-ireland-liz-truss-talks-eu
1/14/2022,"The government is in dispute over millions of surgical gowns supplied by the PPE business awarded £203m contracts via the fast-track “VIP lane” following a referral by the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, it has emerged. The health minister Edward Argar broke with more than a year of secrecy over the surgical gowns supplied by the company, PPE Medpro, telling Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, this week that the government was “in mediation” with the company.  Previously, the last solid information provided about PPE Medpro’s products was in December 2020, when the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said: “The gowns delivered by MedPro [sic] have not been distributed to the frontline.” DHSC sources said then that the gowns – delivered by PPE Medpro under its second contract, for £122m – were still being “evaluated” to ensure they met safety and quality standards. The Guardian recently reported that Lady Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, appear to have been secretly involved in the business of PPE Medpro, despite their repeated denials that they had any “role or function” in the company. The government revealed in November that Mone had originally referred the company in May 2020 to the office of her fellow Conservative peer Theodore Agnew, a minister responsible for procurement in the Cabinet Office during the pandemic. Agnew referred PPE Medpro to the VIP fast-track process for politically connected firms, and within weeks the DHSC awarded the company contracts totalling £203m. The VIP lane was ruled unlawful by the high court this week, following a challenge by the Good Law Project, with Mrs Justice O’Farrell ruling that it breached the requirement to treat potential suppliers equally. Argar refused earlier this month to tell Rayner whether the gowns supplied by PPE Medpro had been used, saying this was “commercially sensitive”. Asked by Rayner to clarify how this was deemed to be the case, the minister provided his answer on 11 January, saying: “The information is considered commercially sensitive as the department is currently engaged in a mediation process with PPE Medpro concerning their products, which involves confidentiality undertakings.” Mediation is a method of resolving contractual disputes to avoid litigation in the courts. Anthony Page, a director and the sole registered owner of PPE Medpro Ltd in the UK, who works for Barrowman in the Isle of Man, confirmed that mediation was ongoing over the gowns, saying via a lawyer that “a dispute was raised many months after delivery”. The lawyer said: “Our client vigorously defends its position in relation to the supply of the gowns that were supplied on time, at a very competitive price and fully in accordance with the contract.” He said the face masks supplied by PPE Medpro – under its first contract for £80.85m – “was all carried out without any challenge whatsoever at any time”. Rayner said: “This government has wasted millions on crony contracts doled out through the VIP lane, which the high court found was not just dodgy but outright illegal. “No wonder they are desperate to cover up the facts. But hiding behind the cover of commercial sensitivity just won’t wash with the public, whose money they were spending. We need to know if this PPE was actually used to protect NHS staff and what the government is doing to recover taxpayers’ cash if any of it was not.” A DHSC spokesperson said: “All PPE must undergo rigorous checks so they meet the safety and quality required. The department is undertaking work across the entire portfolio of PPE contracts to identify all instances of supplier non-delivery or product quality failure, and to recover the costs of undelivered or substandard PPE.” The spokesperson clarified that this referred broadly to all PPE, “not specifically to Medpro”, and declined to answer questions about the mediation or the PPE Medpro products, saying these details were “commercially sensitive”.",News/World news,Government in dispute with ‘VIP lane’ firm referred by Tory peer,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/government-dispute-vip-lane-firm-referred-tory-peer-michelle-mone-ppe-medpro
1/14/2022,"A second big energy supplier has been forced to apologise to thousands of British households after offering unwelcome advice on how to keep warm during the national energy crisis – with a pair of socks. E.ON Next said it was “incredibly sorry” after sending pairs of polyester socks branded with advice to turn heating down to help reduce carbon emissions to about 30,000 households which had taken part in an energy saving campaign last year.  Many of the new E.ON Next sock-owners took to social media to criticise the “pitiful package” which was delivered to homes in the same week that Ovo Energy was forced to apologise for a customer letter urging households to cuddle a pet or perform star jumps to keep warm. British households face some of the highest energy bills on record this winter, due to record high market prices which could drive fuel poverty levels to the highest since records began. E.ON Next said on Twitter: “If you recently received a pair of socks from us, we would like to say we are incredibly sorry for how we have made some people feel. In light of the seriousness of current challenges that many people are facing, this mailing should have been stopped and we are sorry.” The apology comes days after Stephen Fitzpatrick, the owner boss of Ovo Energy, which bought SSE’s supply business two years ago, was forced to apologise for a “ridiculous” email which urged customers to enjoy “hearty bowls of porridge” or a “hula hoop contest” to help stay warm this winter. “It’s really upsetting and embarrassing for me to come on air and apologise for something that we really should never have written,” Fitzpatrick told the BBC. A spokesman for E.ON Next, part of the Germany energy giant E.ON, said the socks were “in no way designed to detract from the seriousness of the current energy crisis” and the work the company has been doing “to lessen its impact on our customers”. “This campaign originally went ahead last year and was intended as a fun way to encourage people to think about ‘lightening your carbon footprint’ and isn’t meant to be anything to do with the current challenges many people are facing,” the spokesman added.",News/Business,E.ON says sorry for sending socks to customers with advice to keep warm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/eon-says-sorry-for-sending-socks-to-customers-with-advice-to-keep-warm
1/14/2022,"The proportion of infants in hospital with Covid-19 in the UK has risen with the spread of Omicron, figures suggest, although researchers have urged calm, noting most cases are very mild. The number of Covid-positive admissions, whatever the cause, is expected to rise when there is more infection around, but the latest figures suggest there has been a shift in the proportion of children in hospital with coronavirus who are infants.  The data from the Isaric/Co-CIN study, published on Friday by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and based on a broadly representative subset of NHS hospitals, reveals that in previous Covid waves about 30% of children in hospital with the virus were under the age of one. Between mid-December and mid-January, however, when Omicron spread rapidly around the country, the proportion was just over 42%, with children from the most deprived areas most affected. Calum Semple, a professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said infants were generally experiencing very mild symptoms. “I really want to emphasise here the fact that these are not particularly sick infants. In fact, they’re coming in for short periods of time for investigations,” he said. “If we look at those who went on to a high dependency unit, our intensive care unit, again, the proportions have fallen over time.” A similar trend has been recorded for the proportion requiring oxygen, and the time infants spend in hospital has fallen from almost seven days in the first Covid-19 wave to just under two days. Dr Camilla Kingdon, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the infants’ symptoms fit withwhat would be expected in a busy winter in the UK. “So we’re not, on the shop floor as it were, picking up any signals that are overly concerning about this,” she said. Most infants in hospital with coronavirus experience a fever and a cough. One potential factor behind the shift in proportions could be that older children have been vaccinated, but experts say it is unlikely to fully explain the situation. Even among children under 12, the proportion of infants in hospital with Covid-19 has risen. “It may just be that because of vaccination and infection having been through the elderly and the younger adults, we may just be seeing a much harder hit in the younger age groups at this point,” said Semple. Among other tentative explanations, Russell Viner, a professor of child and adolescent health at UCL, said Omicron appeared to affect the upper airways more than previous variants, and younger children have smaller upper airways. He also suggested Omicron might potentially be more likely to cause fever and cold-like symptoms in younger children than previous variants, and that protective care pathways meant such symptoms might indicate a hospital visit.",News/World news,More UK infants in hospital amid Omicron wave but experts urge calm,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/omicron-rise-uk-infants-hospitalised-covid-figures-suggest

1/14/2022,"There is a reason so many discussions about tackling the climate crisis have become discussions about finance, investments and pensions. The global effort to avert the most catastrophic effects of global heating is in one sense an emergency mission to reallocate financial resources. This has prompted a fundamental shift in the world of investing. Your pension savings and other investments may well be supporting businesses that can make a big difference to the global climate effort – whether through their actions or their inaction. Likewise, those businesses are also key to addressing other social issues, such as growing inequality and a lack of diversity. Your money can influence the direction these companies take. After all, businesses are answerable to their shareholders and investors.  However, being a responsible investor is arguably very different from being a responsible consumer. When you swap out items in your shopping basket for more ethical or eco-friendly substitutes, you already know the difference between, say, laundry detergent and fabric conditioner. The same might not apply to investing, particularly if you’re a novice. More importantly, unlike ethical consumerism, responsible investing isn’t always as straightforward as substituting items in your shopping basket for more sustainable alternatives. That’s because investors can exert influence on companies in different ways – and are therefore faced with different considerations and questions. So, to make the world of responsible investing easier to navigate, we’ve produced an online guide exploring the issues, the dilemmas, the jargon and the watchouts. The aim is to help you to become as savvy at responsible investing as you are at responsible shopping. Here’s an overview of some of the issues explored in the online guide: The new languageA shift towards valuing companies against their impact on the planet and people, rather than valuing them solely against their profits, has introduced new words and acronyms to the world of investing. For instance, investors and pension holders are paying increasing attention to how companies perform against so-called ESG criteria, which stands for environmental, social and governance. Other acronyms refer to different types of ESG targets, standards and disclosures. But there’s no need to be put off, thanks to our handy guide. Guarding against greenwashingVague and imprecise language can leave room for misleading or unsubstantiated claims about a company’s climate credentials – otherwise known as greenwashing. For instance, what do words such as “green” and “eco” actually mean? Corporate greenwashing can make it more difficult for people to make informed decisions. It also undermines genuine efforts by companies to clean up their acts and tackle the climate crisis. So, whether you’re a consumer or an investor, the ability to call out corporate greenwashing is fast becoming a key life skill. Our online guide therefore examines how investors can guard against it. Divestment or engagementThis has become a key dilemma. Should responsible investors sell their stakes in companies that fall short on ethical or environmental issues, or should they instead retain their holdings and use their position as shareholders to influence those companies that need to do better? The debate is often couched as the “divestment versus engagement” dilemma, and there are strong feelings on either side. One problem with divesting is that there will likely be less-scrupulous investors out there happy to step in. “Ditching and switching” can therefore all too often entail offloading polluting operations to less- accountable or responsible owners. Divesting from heavily polluting companies can also make it harder for them to raise funds to finance their transition to cleaner ways of operating. Retaining an investment means retaining a seat at the table, which allows investors to put pressure on boardrooms to change. This can often lead to more effective results. We explore why it’s useful to move beyond the divestment versus engagement dichotomy and instead view divestment as a threat of last resort that can strengthen shareholders’ position when engaging with companies. The art of influencingSo how exactly can investors persuade a company to reduce its carbon footprint or tackle the mistreatment of workers in its supply chain? From gently nudging to headline-grabbing public confrontations, we explore how shareholders can put pressure on companies to step up. Engagement can be undertaken by individual investors and pension holders, or by shareholder action groups. But it can carry even more weight when undertaken by asset managers who work for pension and investment firms. These asset managers invest and manage investment funds on behalf of individuals, pooling their resources, and so they typically control much larger stakes in each company they invest in. Shareholder engagement can require a great deal of perseverance and expertise. In the online guide, we ask several asset managers how they go about it, and how their roles have changed as a result of the industry’s shift to more responsible investing. Scale and impactIt can be tempting to focus on smaller startups that offer exciting solutions to sustainability issues. They may well be deserving of investment, but it’s worth considering that while larger, more established companies may be less exciting, their actions can potentially be more impactful thanks to their market clout. Shareholder engagement with them to accelerate their shift to greener, fairer ways of operating can often have an outsized impact on wider global efforts by dint of their scale and the size of their supply chains. Put simply, they have more room to improve. They may also have a greater imperative to do so, given that they will likely be more exposed to the financial fallout of the climate crisis, as well as to future regulations and the prospect of reputational damage. This illustrates how, for businesses and investors alike, the financial case for responsible investment and the moral case have become increasingly linked.

1/14/2022,"Fashion-conscious Italian police are in revolt after receiving batches of pink face masks to wear on duty, arguing that the “eccentric” colour is ill-matched with their uniforms. Police units in six cities were sent the FFP2 masks from the office of Italy’s Covid-19 emergency commissioner, Francesco Paolo Figliuolo.  After opening the boxes, many of the officers refused to wear the “inappropriate” masks, prompting Stefano Paolini, the chief of a police union, to write a letter to the head of police at the interior ministry, Lamberto Giannini. Paolini wrote that the decision to approve the purchase of pink masks for the police force was puzzling. He claimed the colour was “eccentric” in respect to police uniform and risked jeopardising the image of the institution. “We ask you to take immediate action to ensure that the police carry out their duty wearing masks of a colour (white, blue or black) which is consistent with the uniform of the state police,” he wrote. The masks were sent to police units in Pavia, Varese, Ferrara, Venice, Syracuse and Venice. In a subsequent statement, Paolini said the problem did not arise because of prejudice against the colour pink, “but from the fact that the uniform is regulated”. “On the basis of the oath made, the uniform must be worn with decorum,” he added, while stressing that “during a period of rising aversion towards the police, it’s necessary to adopt sobriety and respect”. Corriere della Sera reported that the face masks were among a batch also sent to staff at other public institutions, including schools, hospitals and the civil protection office. In late December, Italy reintroduced the requirement for face masks to be worn outside amid a surge in coronavirus infections driven by the Omicron variant. It was already obligatory to wear masks in enclosed public spaces, including on public transport.",News/World news,Italian police object to being sent pink face masks to wear on duty,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/italian-police-object-pink-face-masks-wear-on-duty
1/14/2022,"I left my husband last summer. We have three young children who live with me, but see their dad regularly. Things are cordial and he is financially supporting us. However, the separation has highlighted the distance there’s always been between us in our decade-long relationship. My husband is a hard worker but emotionally distant and can be blind to my needs and those of the children. We’d been living abroad, very rurally, for nine years, doing up a house – and I home-educated the children. I have become increasingly depressed since the separation and am kicking myself for decisions I’ve made and gone along with.  During our relationship, I kept trying to convince my husband that we should move to a town, but he was adamant we couldn’t afford it. That had been dragging on for years, with him insisting on doing the renovation work himself. Eventually I cracked, moved into town and enrolled the kids (one of whom I think has special educational needs) in schools. My husband says he wants to move in with us again at some point, to keep the family together. What I want is time and space to get settled in this next stage, to support my children through all the big changes and prepare for a return to work. He’s very focused on keeping the family and marriage together. I just wonder if I’m making a huge mistake. I’m doubting every decision, having intrusive thoughts and feel out of control. I want to be a strong, stable parent, but I feel lost and wonder how I’ve ended up like this. First things first: when you have these dark thoughts, please contact the Samaritans in your country (they do operate there, I checked). But going back to the letter, you ask if you’ve made a mistake, but not about what. Leaving your husband, or possibly letting him back into your life? In your original, much longer, letter, you told me about your traumatic childhood and emotionally distant father; your lack of sex life with your husband; your dalliance with another man just to “feel something” again. But you have made incredible progress these past few months and do have a road map for the next stage (whatever that ends up being). You’ve moved into town to have contact with people, you’ve got your children into a school and are having more of their needs – and, hopefully, yours – met. I contacted couples psychotherapist Murray Blacket, who observed: “A difficult and protracted house renovation in a remote location in a different country does not sound like a very emotionally connected project. Did you share this dream?” I wonder if you hoped that if you kept trying you’d get some warmth from your husband, but this seems to have come at the expense of your mental health. It’s time to think about your needs. Blacket felt you had made some “big, decisive choices, none of which can have been easy to do or accomplish. It also sounds as if you’ve not been happy anywhere along the way.” Would you say this is true? I think you know what you want but you don’t trust yourself. Your husband wanting to keep the family together is a laudable aim, but I think you both need to decide, and agree, what a marriage actually is, and I think this is at the heart of your issues, because you seem to have very different needs and expectations. I would urge you to get some counselling (together if possible), and sit tight on any decisions – including whether your husband should move back in – until you know what you want. You clearly feel very unhappy and must listen to these feelings even if they seem to defy logic.",Lifestyle/Life and style,I left my husband on good terms but now I feel out of control | Ask Annalisa Barbieri,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/14/i-left-my-husband-on-good-terms-but-now-i-feel-out-of-control
1/14/2022,"If you’re merely having a damp January, rather than a dry one – that is, you are cutting down instead of cutting out – you may well be more attracted by low-alcohol than by no-alcohol drinks, which I wrote about last week. So far as wine is concerned, at least, there’s a lot to be said for it, too. There are some more than drinkable wines out there at 12% ABV or under – mainly whites and sparkling wines, it has to be said, although a number of producers are now making reds at 9%, among them the charmingly named Sunny With a Chance of Flowers pinot noir I’ve recommended below. Unlike most low-alcohol reds, it’s not too sweet, either, the usual downside to lower alcohol being higher sugar, though that matters less with riesling, where that’s generally offset by a crisp acidity. A small glass of 8% Mosel riesling, such as Dr Loosen’s delicious Erdener Treppchen Riesling Kabinett 2019 (£16.99 Rannoch Scott, or £35 by the magnum from Waitrose Cellar), for example, is just one unit. (Incidentally, you can work out the number of units in your drink by multiplying the ABV by the volume of the drink in millilitres, then dividing that by 1,000, so, 8 x 125 ÷ 1,000 = 1.)  So-called “small” or “table” beers, meanwhile, have been around for a while, spearheaded by the likes of the Kernel Brewery and the Small Beer Brew Co, but an increasing number of others are now also offering beers that come in at less than 4%. And they manage to pack a lot of flavour into the bottle or can, too, and are a particularly easy way to cut back on your consumption. More surprising, to me at least, it turns out there is also an equivalent in the cider world – small cider, or “ciderkin”, according to RK French’s The History and Virtues of Cyder. As well as the extraordinary Templar’s Choice in my choices below, I love Pilton’s Pomme Pomme (£6.95 a half-bottle from their websitepiltoncider.com), which at 4.8% is slightly higher, and deliciously infused with quince. You can, of course, also get low-alcohol spirits, though part of me wonders why you would, given that they can be more expensive than the full-strength version. Granted, they make life easier, plus it’s less tempting to have a lower-strength spirit to play with. Maybe they’re more for budding mixologists than for those of us who like our drinks neat, but I can’t help but feel that having a single instead of a double of your usual bevvy might not be a better solution. Templar’s Choice Late Harvest Cider £7 for 750ml templarscider.co.uk, £8.50 cideriswine.co.uk, 3%. Made by a British couple in Normandy, this deeply flavoured, off-dry cider is an extraordinary drink, almost like liquid tarte tatin. Newtown Park All Day Long Table Beer £3.50 for 440ml Two Belly, £3.65 Hop, Burns & Black, 3%. Yet another quirky Bristol brewery doing its thing. They also have a 3.9% pale ale called Yelling at Inanimate Objects. As you do. Sunny With a Chance of Flowers 2019 £10.75 (on offer) Booths, £12.50 Aitken’s of Dundee, 9%. Who can resist a wine with name like this? Light, but with a proper pinot character. The Doctor’s Riesling 2019 £13.95 Frontier Fine Wines, £10.99 New Zealand House of Wine, 9%. Crisp, limey, off-dry riesling from Forrest, the Kiwi pioneers of the 9% wine. Perfect for Thai food. Cut Classic Premium Light Spirit Drink made with Aged Caribbean Rum £30, 20%. Decent, low-alcohol dark spirits are few and far between, so this is welcome, if a bit pricey.

1/14/2022,"Three activists who targeted London’s public transport network to raise the alarm about the escalating climate crisis have been acquitted by a jury. The three Extinction Rebellion campaigners disrupted rush hour services for more than an hour in east London in 2019, with two of them climbing on top of the train and a third gluing himself to one of the carriages.  On Friday at the Inner London crown court a jury found them not guilty of of obstructing the railway at Shadwell station. During the trail the jury were presented with a set of facts – accepted by both the prosecution and defence – about the scale and severity of the climate crisis. Zoë Blackler from Extinction Rebellion said the verdict proved that when a jury hears “the truth … with the depth and seriousness they won’t get from the government or the media, they understand the urgent need to act.” The three defendants – the Rev Sue Parfitt, 79, Father Martin Newell, 54, and former university lecturer Philip Kingston, 85 – said they were strongly motivated by their Christian faith – with Kingston adding the futures of his four grandchildren also prompted him to take part in the protest. Blackler said: “The real criminals here aren’t three committed Christians risking their liberty to sound the alarm on a threat of existential proportions, but a government failing to do what’s necessary to safeguard the future of the human race.” The action led to delays for thousands of people with 15 trains affected. The activists said they had planned the demonstration to ensure there was no risk to public safety by targeting a station above ground and having 10 more Extinction Rebellion activists on the platform to ensure violence did not break out. The verdict is the latest in which juries have acquitted protesters. Earlier this month four people were cleared of criminal damage over toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol and throwing it in the harbour. In December six Extinction Rebellion activists, whose protest halted transport links serving London’s financial district, were also acquitted by a jury. And in April last year, six others were cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell’s London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors they had no defence in law. Mike Schwarz, solicitor at Hodge Jones and Allen who represented the defendants, said: “There is mounting evidence from the courts and in particular from juries that the public is taking the climate crisis and the increasingly urgent need to focus on it far more seriously than government and business. This verdict is part of this escalating pattern.”",News/Environment,Extinction Rebellion activists cleared over London rush hour disruption,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/14/extinction-rebellion-activists-cleared-london-rush-hour-2019
1/14/2022,"A high-profile UK fracking company has been taken over by a green energy group and now has an anti-fracking campaigner as a director. Yorkshire-based Third Energy was at the forefront of efforts to produce fossil gas and intended to use high-pressure fluids to fracture shale rocks under the county. But it was hampered by permit delays and fierce local opposition.  Now the company has been taken over by Wolfland Group, a renewable energy company. It has halted all fossil fuel production from its conventional gas wells and has no plans for further exploration or development. Instead it will focus on green energy, including solar farms, and the use of existing wells for geothermal energy and the burial of captured carbon dioxide emissions. Steve Mason was a leading figure in the anti-fracking campaign in Yorkshire and is now a director of Wolfland Group. “The current energy crisis has shown that we must be energy independent as a nation and that fossil fuels need to be urgently replaced by clean renewable energy supplies, which will lead to cheaper energy and help us tackle climate change,” he said. “We believe we’re now a real-life example of walking the talk and turning stranded fossil fuel assets into green energy solutions.” Mike O’Shea, chief executive of Wolfland Group, said: “Taking a dirty fossil fuel fracking company and flipping it into a green energy beacon [is] an amazing opportunity.” Russell Hoare, managing director at Third Energy, said: “Our [previous] shareholder was actively pursuing oil and gas development in the US and Ukraine. It was difficult to find green investment with the balance still swinging towards fossil fuels. Now we can say we have absolutely no interest in fossil fuels and we can move forward to a sustainable future.” Nevertheless, the company will not be changing its name. “Third Energy perfectly describes the energy transition that needs to take place in the UK,” said Mason. “The first energy was fossil fuels, the second energy was nuclear and now the third energy is renewables. It’s a perfect brand for renewable energy.” Gas prices are currently very high and rising energy bills have sparked fears over the rising cost of living for many families. A few commentators have called for increased gas production in the UK, but experts say this would do nothing to reduce dependence on the fuel or its cost, the price of which is set by international markets. Instead, campaigners are calling on Boris Johnson to provide home insulation for people on low incomes and a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to fund emergency support for vulnerable people.",News/Environment,Leading UK fracking firm taken over by green energy group,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/14/leading-uk-fracking-firm-taken-over-by-green-energy-group
1/14/2022,"The French government will force EDF, the state energy giant, to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year. The company lost a fifth of its market value on Friday after the French government set out plans to cap rising energy bills, which include forcing EDF to sell electricity generated by its fleet of nuclear reactors to rival home suppliers at well below the current record high market prices.  The move underlines pressure on governments across Europe to help households squeezed by the cost-of-living crisis. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been accused of being “missing in action” over soaring energy bills. He has been in talks with MPs and companies to agree a package of measures to soften the blow of the national energy crisis, but no decisions have been made. In Spain, the government introduced a windfall tax on electricity generators and gas producers that are able to profit from the record market highs to help keep home energy bills low. In Germany, the government has slashed a surcharge on bills used to support renewable energy schemes, which will instead receive extra state subsidies drawn from higher carbon taxes. EDF also told investors that its nuclear power generation for the year ahead would be about 10% lower than initially expected due technical problems at a handful of its nuclear reactors. The French government, which faced fierce public protest against fuel price hikes in 2018, has already cut some electricity taxes to help slow the rise in home energy bills at an estimated €8bn cost to the state. Governments across Europe are under pressure to intervene in the energy market to protect households against an unprecedented surge in wholesale market prices, driven by a global gas supply crunch that has lifted markets to all-time highs. Under the French government’s new measures, it has kept a tight lid on the regulated price that EDF is allowed to charge for its nuclear electricity, which will rise to €46.2 per megawatt-hour, from €42/MWh, despite a record surge in electricity market prices across Europe in recent months. EDF said the plan could hit its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by between €7.7bn and €8.4bn based on market prices in December and January. Barbara Pompili, France’s environment minister, said the government planned to help EDF withstand the blow but has offered no details on this. The nuclear power giant also told investors that its reactors would generate less electricity than expected this year. This is because of a string of faults at five of its nuclear plants which will require downtime to undertake maintenance work. EDF estimates that it will generate 300-330 terawatt-hours this year, down from 330-360 TWh previously. The company’s share price tumbled from €10.35 at Thursday’s close to €7.92 on Friday morning.",News/Business,France to force EDF to take €8.4bn hit with energy bill cap,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills
1/14/2022,"Four Windrush generation descendants have lost their high court battle for the scheme for victims to be widened to include them. Yvonne Williams, Yvonne Smith, Jennifer Ulett-Hall and Damian Gabrielle argued in the high court that the Windrush scheme should be extended beyond its current parameters to include descendants of the Windrush generation such as them.  The current rules state that children who arrived as adults over the age of 18 after 1988 are excluded from the scheme. This group do not have a path to citizenship through the Windrush scheme even if they have been resident in the UK for many years. All four made applications to the Windrush scheme, which were rejected. Reviews of the rejection decisions were also unsuccessful. All are at risk of removal from the UK as they are not eligible to remain here under the Windrush scheme. They plan to submit ordinary (non-Windrush) applications for leave to remain under the immigration rules. All four have Windrush families who they came to the UK to join. The three women in the case are all grandmothers. Lawyers for Gabrielle, 39, who arrived in the UK two months after his 18th birthday to join his father, argued it was because of the problems his father experienced due to Windrush generation discrimination that he was unable to bring Gabrielle to the UK to join him until after his 18th birthday. His father came to the UK in 1961 and has lived here continuously since then. Smith and Williams were detained in Yarls Wood immigration detention centre in Bedfordshire for several months because the Home Office planned to deport them to Jamaica. Grace Brown, counsel for the four claimants, said discretion should be exercised based on the individual facts of the group, who arrived in the UK over the age of 18 to join Windrush generation family members. But Edward Brown, counsel for the home secretary, argued that none of the claimants fell within any of the Windrush categories and that they had not suffered the injustices of the Windrush generation. Mrs Justice Ellenbogen rejected the judicial review application made by the four and said none of the proposed grounds of challenge were arguable. Gabrielle said: “I am absolutely devastated by today’s decision. Most of my adult life has been in limbo. For me, the UK is my home. It’s where my mum, dad, brothers, sisters and extended family all live. I thought that today would have given me – and other Windrush descendants who are in a similar predicament – hope. But that has been taken away from us.” Karen Doyle of Movement For Justice, which has campaigned for inclusion of Windrush descendants in the Windrush scheme, said: “The damage done to the Windrush generation was not just to the individuals. It was damage done to whole families separated across borders. Families who came to rebuild Britain and were subject to brutal discrimination and racism. Many had to leave children behind they would otherwise have brought. “Reuniting and offering security to those families now in the wake of the Windrush scandal would have been putting the government’s apologies into action. Yet this government continues to fail the Windrush generation and their families at every stage. We are deeply disappointed in this decision but will continue to fight for the recognition and status of Windrush descendants.” The Home Office has been approached.",News/UK news,Windrush descendants lose high court fight to expand scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/windrush-descendants-lose-fight-to-expand-compensation-scheme
