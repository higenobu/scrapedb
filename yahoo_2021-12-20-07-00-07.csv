12/20/2021,"BEIJING (AP) — Four people died and eight were injured after a section of a highway flyover in China’s central Hubei province collapsed, according to Chinese authorities. The accident occurred at about 3:30 p.m. Saturday in the city of Ezhou, with about 500 meters (1,640 feet) of the bridge built over an expressway collapsing onto the roadway below, according to transport and police authorities. Three trucks on the bridge fell off it and one car was crushed under the debris, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, which cited local authorities. The expressway was closed due to the incident. Work was being carried out on the bridge when the accident occurred, although it is not clear how many workers were present at the time. Preliminary investigations revealed that a truck weighing a total of 198 tons had broken into two pieces while falling off the structure. The newspaper Beijing News said the truck was four times over the allowable weight limit on the flyover, which was built 11 years ago. Transport Ministry officials were on the scene conducting an investigation, the reports said.",World/Associated Press,4 dead in collapse of highway flyover in central China,https://news.yahoo.com/4-dead-collapse-highway-flyover-131737509.html
12/20/2021,"As Dr. Anthony Fauci is sounding the alarm about the spread of the Omicron variant, Sarah Palin is touting her unvaccinated status as a badge of honor while telling a crowd to “stiffen your spine” in the face of pressure to get inoculated against the disease. Speaking about Omicron on Meet the Press, Fauci said on Sunday, “The one thing that’s very clear, and there’s no doubt about this, is its extraordinary capability of spreading — its transmissibility capability. It is just, you know, raging through the world.” On CNN, the doctor cautioned that Omicron will “take over” as the dominant variant and warned Americans to brace themselves for “a tough few weeks to months.” More from Rolling Stone These Rapid Covid Tests Are Selling Out Online As People Gather (Cautiously) for the Holidays Miami's Jingle Ball Concert Canceled Due to 'Increased Transmission' of Omicron Variant LCD Soundsystem Cancel Brooklyn Residency Due to Omicron Surge Fauci told Chuck Todd that even though, according to data from South Africa, Omicron appears to cause milder disease or less need for supplemental oxygen and hospitalization, people should still be cautious because there may be other reasons that explain why South Africa is seeing seemingly milder cases. “You’ve got to be careful,” Fauci said. ‘That might be due really to the fact that their population has so much experience with prior infections that it might be underlying immunity that’s making it look like it’s less severe. And as a virus, it inherently may not be less severe.” Even if Omicron is a less severe form of the disease, the doctor noted, hospital systems across the country are already overwhelmed with patients suffering from the Delta variant, so there is not much room for another wave of sick patients. Although vaccines have shown to have some efficacy against Omicron, Fauci said that “the real problem” for hospitals in the U.S. is the fact that “we have so many people in this country who are eligible to be vaccinated who have not yet been vaccinated.” One of those unvaxxed people is former Republican vice presidential hopeful Sarah Palin, who proudly told a crowd at Turning Points USA’s AmericaFest that she has not gotten the vaccine. Sarah Palin showed up in Phoenix this morning to tell that crowd “it will be over my dead body” that she gets vaccinated. Then she encourages others to “stiffen their spines” and fight back. “There is an empowerment in a group like this where we can kind of feed off each other.” pic.twitter.com/t47oxxrGtB — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) December 19, 2021 “It’ll be over my dead body that I’ll have to get a shot,” Palin said, and the crowd erupted in applause. “I will not do it. I won’t do it, and they better not touch my kids either.” When the moderator pointed out that some schools are requiring Covid vaccinations for students, Palin encouraged parents to stand up in protest, “Yeah, I know, and I think if enough of us, though, rise up and say enough is enough — there are more of us than there are of them. So for us to be hesitant, and for us to kinda wait for somebody else to take this on and say, ‘No, enough is enough.’ You need to all look around and realize that as you stiffen your spine and take those positions that you know are right, especially when it comes to government telling us what we have to inject things in our own bodies … realize that those around you as you stiffen your spine, their spines, too, will stiffen.” “There is empowerment in a group like this,” she added.

12/20/2021,"A four-day electronic music festival took place in the socially conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Martin Garrix, David Guetta, and Tiësto were among the internationally famous DJs to perform. Bloomberg reported that women wore ""skintight pants,"" and the smell of marijuana wafted up from the crowd. A four-day music festival took place in a desert in Saudi Arabia this weekend, and a Bloomberg report says it looked remarkably similar to its' Western equivalents. MDLBEAST Soundstorm 2021 kicked off on December 16 on the outskirts of Riyadh, the socially conservative nation's capital, and it featured internationally famous DJs like Martin Garrix, David Guetta, and Tiësto. The festival organizers say that 200,000 people attended on the second day alone, making it one of the best-attended music events in the world, the Saudi Gazette reported. ""Women and men danced with abandon"" as electronic music blared, Bloomberg said, only for the rave to be temporarily put on pause for 15 minutes while participants responded to the Islamic call to prayer. Bloomberg reported that the women at MDLBEAST Soundstorm 2021 wore everything from ""skintight pants"" to ""full-length robes and face veils."" Saudi women are required to dress modestly, per The Week, meaning that tight-fitting clothing is generally prohibited. Traditionally, women were expected to wear the abaya — a loose overgarment — in public, but Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman relaxed this dress code requirement in 2018. According to Bloomberg, other sights to behold were a sign of ""pushing boundaries"" as the kingdom transforms. Previously, religious police once punished restaurants for playing music — a far cry from this weekend's reported activities. ""Inebriated men stumbled through crowds perfumed with the distinct scent of marijuana,"" said Bloomberg, ""alongside a limited but notable display of local queer culture."" Cannabis, alcohol, and homosexuality are forbidden in Saudi Arabia, but Bloomberg described a ""carnival-like"" atmosphere where these rules were apparently snubbed. Critics have accused the festival organizers of ""culture-washing."" Resident Advisor journalist Joe Siltanen said it was an attempt to distract from the ""authoritarian regime."" MDLBEAST Soundstorm 2021 was just one event in a roster of activities this month, spearheaded by the crown prince, to create the optics of a softer and more secular image of the kingdom. Recently, Saudi Arabia hosted a Formula One race and two art biennials. An oil-themed amusement park is also being opened as part of Saudi Vision 2030, as Insider previously reported, which is a strategic framework to diversify the nation's dependence on oil and move towards entertainment and tourism.

12/20/2021,"The traveling “History Tour” featuring former President Donald Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly saw yet another underwhelming crowd during its Houston leg on Saturday, The Houston Chronicle reported. “Top sections were blocked off, and there were still plenty of seats available” at the slated start time. The event took place at the Toyota Center in downtown Houston. Chronicle reporter Jeremy Wallace tweeted a photo showing a large number of empty seats. Five minutes before tipoff and this what it looks like around the arena as Trump and O’Reilly prepare to take the stage. Top sections are blocked off. Kind of looking like a Houston Texans crowd.

O’Reilly explained to the audience that the former president had been delayed by the inclement weather, according to the Chronicle. A message from a tardy Trump was posted on the Twitter account of his aide Liz Harrington, saying “airport opened, landing now.” There was no notice on airport websites that Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport or the William P. Lobby Airport were closed on Saturday. O’Reilly, who was fired from Fox News in 2017 after being accused of sexual harassment, boasted of a “great crowd” at the Toyota Center.

To fill empty spots, attendees moved to lower seats. Thousands of seats were unsold for the Orlando event, according to sales data tracked by the Orlando Sentinel. Only 5,406 of 8,700 tickets on sale prior to the event at the Amway Center stadium were sold, according to records at the city-owned stadium. The stadium’s total listed capacity did not include “vast swaths of the upper bowl covered with a tarp before the event started,” the newspaper reported. The Amway Center’s listed capacity for the “end-stage setup” utilized by Trump and O’Reilly is generally between 12,500 and 17,000, according to the newspaper. The “History Tour” wraps up Sunday in Dallas.
