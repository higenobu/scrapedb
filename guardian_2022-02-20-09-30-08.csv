2/20/2022,"Thousands of homes were left without power on Saturday night, as forecasters predicted gusts of up to 80mph were set to batter again Britain on Sunday. The Energy Networks Association said that about 155,000 customers remained without electricity in the south and east of England and Wales after Storm Eunice, while new yellow weather warnings were announced across the UK.  The yellow warning for wind will be in place in England and Wales from midday on Sunday until 3pm on Monday. In Northern Ireland, north-west England, and south-west Scotland, another warning will be in place until midday on Monday. For rain, the yellow warning remains in place from midnight on Saturday until 6pm on Sunday in Cumbria, Lancashire and West Yorkshire. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge told the Guardian we can expect “wet and windy weather” to continue well into next week which will likely impact recovery. “Eunice is gone, but unfortunately things are not settling down,” he said. “There is another area of low pressure up near Iceland, and that will bring very strong winds again through Sunday. As well as that we’ve got reasonably heavy rain as well. “There’s also a fair bit of snow, and the rain is going to melt it. There could be some issues with surface water and flooding in certain areas. “There is not a great deal of respite in terms of lighter winds at all this week, which will really set back clear-up operations.” Rail services across most of the UK suffered major disruption as operators fought the elements to clear fallen debris from the tracks. Most continued to advise customers not to travel unless essential and ran limited services. Meanwhile, airport operations were mostly back to normal at Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester. More than 500 flights to and from the UK were cancelled on Friday. Four fatalities have been confirmed due to Storm Eunice, including a female passenger in her 30s who died after a tree fell on her car. The driver was taken to hospital. In Merseyside, a man was killed by debris hitting the windscreen of the car her was a passenger in. Two men in a pickup truck were crushed by a falling tree in Alton, Hampshire, killing the passenger at the scene and leaving the driver with serious injuries. In Co Wexford in Ireland, a county council worker was killed by a falling tree as he worked to clear debris locally. Emergency services across the country were reportedly overwhelmed with calls from members of the public through Friday and Saturday. Insurance network PwC estimated that insurance losses for Storm Eunice will be between £200 and £300m. Mohammad Khan, general insurance leader at PwC UK, said: “It was expected that Storm Eunice would be severe and we’ve seen the strongest gusts impacting coastal areas as well as travel disruption with airlines and train operators cancelling flights and entire rail lines impacting travel across the country. “As with Storm Dudley, insurance losses will mainly be in respect of damage to homes, commercial properties and vehicles from falling trees and flying debris.”",News/UK news,Forecast of 80mph winds as thousands without power in UK after Storm Eunice,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/forecast-of-80mph-winds-as-thousands-without-power-in-uk-after-storm-eunice
2/20/2022,"Swapping their pastures for the concrete jungle, hundreds of Britain’s farmers will take off their wellies this week and head to a conference centre in central Birmingham for the annual shindig of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). Nearly 1,500 food producers will meet to discuss the “blueprint for the future” of British farming, against the backdrop of the biggest upheaval in a generation in agriculture, following the UK’s departure from the EU and the pandemic, and amid discussions about future land use in the face of the climate crisis.  Farmers insist Covid only increased consumers’ appetite to “buy British”, especially at a time when global supply chains were disrupted. But the past two years have shown it’s not always easy for food producers to get their produce from field to fork. The industry is grappling with worker shortages following Brexit and Covid, when many European workers went back to their home countries. A shortage of workers has already resulted in unpicked fruit being left to rot in fields, and a cull of healthy pigs on farms because of a lack of staff at slaughterhouses. An estimated 35,000 animals have been killed and won’t enter the food chain. All this is taking place before farmers feel the impact of the UK’s post-Brexit trade deals with food-producing nations Australia and New Zealand, which will see their exporters theoretically able to send limitless amounts of lamb, beef and dairy produce to the UK within 15 years. These are bitter pills to swallow for an organisation which backed staying in the EU before the Brexit vote. While the focus of the conference will be on the future, and life beyond the EU’s subsidy scheme – known as the common agricultural policy (CAP) and worth £3bn a year to UK farmers – food producers are, like most other businesses, bearing the brunt of rising costs. The most pressing concerns for most farmers are the three Fs – feed, fuel and fertiliser – all of which rocketed in price, leaving many wondering how much fertiliser they can afford to buy for the spring planting season. Agriculture makes only a very small contribution to the UK’s annual economic output – approximately 0.5% – yet it is the lifeblood of many rural communities, and inflation will be a major worry for people in some of the regions which are at the heart of the government’s levelling-up ambitions. NFU president Minette Batters – who is seeking re-election for a third term representing the interests of around 55,000 English and Welsh farmers – is clear on the importance of farming for ensuring domestic food supply and sustaining rural ways of life. TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson’s attempts to reinvent himself as a farmer may have proved TV ratings gold, and his Clarkson’s Farm series has been recommissioned for a second series, but Batters recently told the Observer that she doubted whether the current crop of politicians understood the importance of agriculture. So you could be forgiven for thinking that George Eustice, secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, and himself of Cornish farming stock, might receive a rather frosty reception from the assembled food producers when he gives a speech at the conference. In recent months, many farmers have criticised the apparent disconnection between Eustice’s resoundingly positive portrayal of the opportunities for British agriculture and the current realities of farming life. Access to seasonal workers remains a thorny issue, with the government keeping the number of permits at the 30,000 allowed in 2021, resisting calls from producers for a significant increase in the quota. Industry insiders criticise Defra, Eustice’s department, for having little influence in cabinet, and say it is the Home Office calling the shots when it comes to setting the numbers for post-Brexit visa allocation for seasonal workers. Far from their fields, expect farmers this week to issue some stark warnings over how continued worker shortages will impact domestic food production, and how “taking back control” could lead to Britons eating more imported food.",News/Business,Australian rivals and Brexit barriers leave UK farmers on stony ground,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/20/australian-rivals-and-brexit-barriers-leave-uk-farmers-on-stony-ground

2/20/2022,"Twenty years since they first met in the ring as amateurs, and after more than a decade of simmering animosity between them, Kell Brook finally gained the sweet vindication he has craved for so long when he stopped Amir Khan in the sixth round on Saturday night in Manchester. Brook reacted to his crushing victory with euphoria while Khan looked dazed and broken after he was helped to his corner. The end, when it came, was as predictable as it was bleak for Khan. He protested meekly to the referee, Victor Loughlin, but he had suffered heavy punishment and, backed up helplessly against the ropes as Brook pummelled him, there could be only one outcome. One last uppercut, which followed percussive combinations, rocked Khan’s head back and, thankfully, Loughlin called a halt to the contest 51 seconds into round six.  Khan had come out fast and thrown some flashy combinations before the true pattern of the fight was established. Brook nailed him with a stiff left hand which made Khan stagger backwards. Despite the shake of his head, it was clear that Khan had been hurt. They had to be separated at the bell but Brook had the look of a man who knew that he was about to dominate the rival he had despised for over a decade. It seemed as if Brook hurt Khan every time he landed with real intent. Khan has always been an immensely brave fighter, however, and he fought back and tagged Brook occasionally with his fast hands. But Brook went downstairs to the body in the fourth round before, with calm deliberation, he began to really open up in the fifth. Khan tried to backpedal away but he could not stem the dark surge of trouble that finally engulfed him. It was a relief when it was all over. Their grudge match had always been bitterly personal to Brook who believed Khan had continually ignored or disrespected him. “Kell’s always been very obsessed with my career, like a fanboy,” Khan said this week. “I’ve been living in his head for such a long time.” He then fuelled the acrimony by saying: “I’m worried about Kell’s health after the beating I’m giving him.” Brook brutally exposed the hubris of Khan. His pleasure in almost certainly ending the career of the man who had been his nemesis for so long will be deep and sustained for Brook has long harboured an intense dislike of Khan. The only danger for Brook is that he will believe overwhelming a faded Khan is a sign that he should campaign again at a far higher level against much younger and far more threatening men. Brook has suffered three crushing defeats over the years and this immensely satisfying win cannot obscure the damage he suffered against far superior fighters in Gennady Golovkin, Errol Spence and Terence Crawford – who stopped him in his previous fight. It would be an uplifting end to the Sheffield fighter’s near 17 years in the professional ring if he could walk away with his health intact at the age of 35. Khan is also 35 and, before he stepped into the ring against Brook, he had said: “If either of us lose, it’s something that will haunt us for a very long time. That’s the reason I’ve trained so hard. I’ve done everything I’ve needed to because I know I can’t lose this fight.” Boxing is a harsh and unforgiving business and so Khan’s bold words were swept aside by the concussive fists of his fierce rival. He will have to learn how to overcome the haunting memories of this painful defeat. It would help if their grudge could be buried now for both men should look to a life beyond the boxing. Of course, Brook will almost certainly box on and said recently that he would like to fight Conor Benn next. The son of Nigel Benn is 10 years younger than Brook and he would bring the violent danger to the ring that is now beyond Khan. So, for a while at least, Brook should savour his victory over Khan because this was one of the most glorious nights of his boxing life. In the main preliminary bout, Natasha Jonas, who is 37, finally won the world title which she has pursued for so long. She had to move up three weight divisions but she boxed with commanding authority to stop Chris Namus, from Uruguay, in the second round to become the new WBO super-welterweight champion. Jonas unleashed a bludgeoning series of combinations to knock down her hapless opponent in the first round. Namus was fortunate to hear the bell but, within 28 seconds of round two, she was sent crashing to the canvas again before the referee brought the one-sided contest to a merciful end. Nine months ago, Jonas fought with grit and skill to nearly beat Katie Taylor, the undisputed lightweight champion who is ranked as the best female fighter in the world. Her admirable performance meant it became even more difficult for Jonas to find meaningful bouts as so many prospective opponents were wary of her. But her desperation to win a world title at the third attempt was fulfilled at last against Namus – who stepped in as a late replacement to fight for the WBO’s vacant championship just eight days ago. An ecstatic Jonas, understandably, did not care about the dubious calibre of Namus as she celebrated her victory with moving emotion.",Sport/Sport,Kell Brook stops Amir Khan in sixth round to win grudge match,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/kell-brook-stops-amir-khan-in-sixth-round-to-win-grudge-match
