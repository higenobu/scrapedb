3/19/2022,"MIAMI (AP) — Adrian Kellgren’s family-owned gun company in Florida was left holding a $200,000 shipment of semi-automatic rifles after a longtime customer in Ukraine suddenly went silent during Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the country. Fearing the worst, Kellgren and his company KelTec decided to put those stranded 400 guns to use, sending them to Ukraine's nascent resistance movement to help civilians fight back against a Russian military that has been repeatedly shelling their apartment buildings, schools, hospitals and hiding places. “The American people want to do something,” said Kellgren, a former U.S. Navy pilot. “We enjoy our freedoms, we cherish those things. And when we see a group of people out there getting hammered like this, it’s heartbreaking.” Cocoa-based KelTec's donation is a high-profile example of Americans collecting guns, ammunition, body armor, helmets and other tactical gear in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s promise to arm his citizens. But many similar grassroots efforts have been snarled by inexperience with the complex web of regulations governing the international shipment of such equipment. Kellgren, who has dealt with such red tape for years, managed to connect through a Ukrainian neighbor with a diplomat in the Ukrainian Embassy who helped him secure a federal arms export license in just four days. That process can often take months. This week, as Congress debated whether to send more advanced weapons and defense systems to Ukraine, workers at KelTec’s warehouse forklifted four plastic-wrapped pallets containing their 9 mm foldable rifles for delivery to an undisclosed NATO-run facility. From there, the shipment’s new recipient, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, will be responsible for smuggling the weapons into the war zone. “That’s when the real derring-do and heroism begins,” Kellgren said. From California to New York, elected officials, sheriff’s departments and nonprofits say they have also collected thousands of sets of body armor and millions of rounds of ammunition for Ukraine. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis kicked off a campaign last week to ask police and sheriff’s departments to donate surplus ballistic helmets and other equipment. “We know that it can urgently be used to help stop Putin and save Ukraine,” he said. But hazards abound: One New York City nonprofit leading an effort to collect tactical gear had 400 bulletproof vests stolen before they could be dispatched. Many of the organizers have no clue how to navigate international arms export rules, which sometimes require approvals from the Departments of State, Commerce and Defense to ship even non-lethal tactical gear. Organizers of one such drive in New York are piggybacking on KelTec's license to export 60 long guns they recently collected. “I’m hoping that this movement spreads through the whole United States and every gun store and every gun manufacturer in the U.S. accepts these donations,” Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said at a news conference Friday. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for firearms manufacturers, distributed step-by-step instructions this week to its more than 8,000 members on how to apply for an expedited export license. They also provided a list of specific sniper rifles, pistols and ammo requested by Ukraine’s Embassy in Washington. KelTec hopes to arrange more shipments in the future. Its license allows the export of up to 10,000 weapons and the company has offered the Ukrainians their own production line and weekly shipments. Details of KelTec’s efforts surfaced in a Justice Department filing this week by a Maryland-based real estate lawyer, Lukas Jan Kaczmarek, who said that as a volunteer with the Ukrainian-American Bar Association he is helping Ukraine acquire weapons in tandem with Volodymyr Muzylov, the first secretary at the Ukraine Embassy. “I expect to work in this capacity for the duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I have not, am not, and shall not receive any monetary compensation for my assistance,” Kaczmarek wrote in his registration as a foreign agent of the Zelenskyy government. KelTec isn’t the only arms manufacturer to have answered the call. Another Florida company, Adams Arms, posted on its Facebook account a video  of what it said is a shipment of carbine rifles destined for Ukraine. The company has also started selling T-shirts emblazoned with the iconic final broadcast of a bombarded Ukrainian Border Guard unit that told a Russian warship to “Go (expletive) Yourself!” Proceeds from shirt sales will go to the Ukrainian National Bank’s war funds. While rifles are no match for Putin’s firepower of Sukhoi fighter jets and cluster bombs, they can play an important role if the Russians get bogged down in street-to-street combat, retired U.S. Army Major John Spencer said. The semi-automatic rifles KelTec is shipping are perhaps even more valuable than high-tech, anti-aircraft missiles that require extensive training beyond the reach of most civilians, many of whom have never even held a gun before, he said. “Every shipment of firearms is critical,” said Spencer, an urban warfare analyst at the Madison Policy Forum, a New York-based think tank. “You’re giving one more fighter, out of tens of thousands, the opportunity to resist with a simple-to-use weapon.” Kellgren said he’s been inspired by the resourcefulness and tenacity of Ukrainian citizens and is confident the rifles he’s sending will make a difference. “The people of Ukraine have had mostly just civilian firearms and they’re holding off a superpower,” he said. “So the X-factor here not isn’t necessarily what equipment you’re holding. ... It comes down to the will to fight.” ___ AP Writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

3/19/2022,"The brother of a Nevada woman who disappeared Saturday from a Walmart parking lot said chilling surveillance video shows a man forcing his way into her car before driving away. Naomi Irion, 18, of Fernley, was last seen about 5 a.m. at the store’s parking lot, according to a Wednesday statement from the Lyon County Sheriff’s Office. Irion’s four-door sedan was later found in an industrial area in Fernley, and a suspect believed to be driving a dark, newer model Chevrolet High Country pickup may know her whereabouts, police said. Irion’s older brother, Casey Valley, 32, said Thursday that surveillance footage from Walmart shows a man in a mask and hoodie walk to the parking lot from the direction of a dirt lot, circle his sister’s car and then force his way in. “He circled around the parking lot maybe to make sure there were no witnesses,” Valley said. “He came up behind the car and forced his way into the driver’s side of the car. Maybe her door was unlocked. He either said or did something to make her move to the passenger seat, and then he drove her car away into an unknown direction.” Representatives with the Lyon County Sheriff’s Office could not be reached Thursday to corroborate Valley’s account. Valley also told NBC affiliate KRNV in Reno about the video. “The forensic evidence discovered, to date, continues to lead Lyon County Investigators to believe Naomi’s disappearance is suspicious in nature,” the sheriff's office statement said. “The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office is seeking any information regarding the disappearance and whereabouts of Naomi Irion, the Chevrolet pickup vehicle and/or information concerning possible contacts that persons may have had with Naomi.” Irion’s car has been searched and forensically analyzed, police said. “Evidence has been recovered and is being expedited for testing through the Washoe County Forensic Investigation Section,” police said. During a news conference Thursday, Lyon County Sheriff Frank Hunewill pleaded with the public to provide tips to help find Irion. ""We are making a plea to the public right now to help us locate our person of interest vehicle,"" Hunewill said of the man police had earlier described as a suspect. Investigators don't have a license plate for the pickup they're looking for, Hunewill said. He added that investigators are trying to talk to witnesses, noting that the man whom police are seeking was seen arriving at the Walmart from an area where homeless people congregate. ""We don't know if this guy is homeless or not because we don't know who he is yet,"" Hunewill said. ""We don't know where his truck's at."" Police said Friday a community search planned for Saturday was not organized by the sheriff's office, but that some officers with the agency's Search and Rescue Team will participate and process any evidence found. Hunewill was joined Thursday at the media briefing by Irion's relatives, including Valley and sibling Tamara Cartwright. Cartwright, who became emotional at times, said Irion was active on social media and the public should scour Instagram and Snapchat for her or the pickup. ""She loves people so much. And that's why she's so trusting,"" Cartwright said. ""I'm so afraid that someone betrayed her trust."" Irion worked at Panasonic and would take a bus to her job after parking at the Walmart, KRNV reported. Valley, who lives with his sibling, said he wants the person of interest to know: “We just want Naomi back — period,” he said. “We just want Naomi, and we’re not going to stop until we find her.”",U.S./NBC News,Nevada woman disappears from Walmart; brother says video shows masked man forcing himself into her car,https://news.yahoo.com/nevada-woman-disappears-walmart-brother-173801015.html

Robert William Shewan, 79, of the 19200 block of Maximo Yabes Avenue in East El Paso County, was arrested Thursday after an investigation by the El Paso Police Department’s Internet Crimes Against Children Unit, according to a news release from the police. The investigation began March 11 when a computer repair store notified police it had found indecent photographs of children, the news release said. Shewan was brought before a judge, who issued a bond of $50,000 on a charge of possession of child pornography. Shewan remains at the El Paso County Jail, police said.

3/19/2022,"Assamad Nash, the 25-year-old man accused of fatally stabbing 35-year-old Christina Yuna Lee last month, has been indicted on multiple felony charges without hate crime enhancements on Wednesday.

Nash was taken into custody shortly after the incident, which occurred inside Lee’s apartment in Manhattan’s Chinatown on Feb. 13. That marked the eighth arrest for the repeat offender since May 2021.

Surveillance footage shows Nash following Lee into her apartment building at 111 Chrystie St. Soon afterward, neighbors heard Lee “calling for help” and pleading for someone to call 911 “over and over and over again.” The authorities, who responded at around 4:35 a.m., found Lee in her bathtub “bleeding from multiple wounds to her body.”

Nash was charged with first-degree murder, first-degree burglary and first-degree burglary as a sexually motivated felony. He entered a not guilty plea through his attorney.
 


Court documents showed that Nash claimed to be a victim as well. He reportedly told police that he was trying to protect Lee, putting the blame on a “dude” who “stabbed us up.”

“I was trying to help this female getting hurt by other people. I was trying to help the lady,” said Nash.

He allegedly tried to leave the building via a fire escape, but he went back inside after realizing that a police officer saw him. He was ultimately arrested after authorities found him naked from the waist up hiding under Lee’s bed.

“Today’s indictment marks the beginning of our pursuit of justice in the name of Christina Yuna Lee, a bright and beloved New Yorker who should not have had her life cut short in such a violent, shocking manner in her own home,” District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. “Ms. Yuna Lee’s death not only devastated her loved ones, but struck fear into the hearts of our AAPI neighbors, who have already suffered far too much pain in recent years.”

 Bragg, who recently announced the creation of Pathways to Public Safety, a new division of his office that will promote alternatives to incarceration, maintained that prison time will continue to be an outcome for the most serious offenses. “All New Yorkers deserve to be safe and secure, and we will ensure accountability for this senseless murder,” he added.At the time of Lee’s murder, Nash, who was reported to be homeless, was out on supervised release for three other open cases. Bodycam footage reportedly showed him telling the police that he was recently released from prison. In a statement, Mayor Eric Adams described Wednesday’s indictment as another “critical step towards delivering justice” for Lee.“I want members of our AAPI community, and all New Yorkers, to know that we are working around the clock to put an end to this violence and ensure that people in every neighborhood can feel safe in our city,” Adams said.  Featured Image via New York Police Department (left), PIX11 News (right) Enjoy this content?

3/19/2022,"By Andrea Shalal, Michael Martina and Ryan Woo WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday of 'consequences' if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the White House said, while both sides stressed the need for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. While the White House did not detail what those consequences could be, or how the U.S. would define ""material support"", press secretary Jen Psaki indicated China's massive trade flows could be impacted. ""Sanctions are certainly one tool in the tool box,"" Psaki told a regular news briefing when asked whether China, the world's largest exporter, could face trade tariffs or sanctions. Speaking after a nearly two-hour video call between Biden and Xi, Psaki said the United States would communicate any consequences directly to Beijing ""with our European partners and counterparts."" In the call, which came at a time of deepening acrimony between the world's two biggest powers, Biden detailed efforts of the United States and its allies to respond to the invasion of Ukraine, including by imposing costs on Russia. ""He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" the White House said in statement, adding that Biden ""underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis."" A senior U.S. official briefing reporters on the call said Biden communicated that Beijing would face consequences not just from the United States but the wider world. ""The president really wasn't making specific requests of China,"" the official said. ""I think our view is that China will make its own decisions."" China's foreign ministry said Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia for the invasion, based on Beijing's statements about the call. ""The top priorities now are to continue dialogue and negotiations, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, cease fighting and end the war as soon as possible,"" Xi said. Xi advocated Russia-Ukraine dialogue and negotiations, and suggested Washington and NATO conduct talks with Russia to solve the ""crux"" of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine. ""The Ukraine crisis is something that we don't want to see,"" Chinese state media quoted Xi saying in the call, which it said was requested by the U.S. side. Xi warned against sanctions. ""Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses,"" the ministry quoted him as saying. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was concerned China was considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment for use in Ukraine, something Beijing has denied. Washington is also worried that China could help Russia circumvent Western economic sanctions. Targeting Beijing with the sort of extensive economic sanctions already imposed on Russia would have potentially dire consequences for the United States and the world, given that China is the world's second-largest economy and the largest exporter. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth week, has killed hundreds of civilians, reduced city areas to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis as millions flee the country. China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion. Russia fired missiles at an airport near Lviv on Friday, a city where hundreds of thousands had sought refuge far from Ukraine's battlefields, as Moscow tries to regain the initiative in its stalled campaign against Ukraine, which it calls a special military operation. U.S.-CHINA TENSIONS Ukraine has added a new front in a U.S.-Chinese relationship already at its worst level in decades, further deflating Biden's initial hopes of easing a wide range of disputes by using a personal connection with Xi that predates his term in office. Biden has been anxious to avoid a new ""Cold War"" with China, seeking instead to define the relationship as one of competitive coexistence, but China's ""no-limits"" strategic partnership with Russia announced last month and its stance on Ukraine has called that into question. Ahead of the call, a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday. The USS Ralph Johnson, an Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyer, shadowed the carrier at least partly on its route. China claims Taiwan as its own, and has stepped up its military activity near the islands, alarming Taipei and Washington amid concerns that Beijing might follow Russia's example and use force. While saying it recognizes Ukraine's sovereignty, Beijing has repeatedly said that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

3/19/2022,"Adobe Stock / Krakenimages.com Sleep has a major impact on our health. A good night's rest can be a game-changer for weight loss, inflammation and even your immune system. Now new research from Northwestern University indicates that the space in which you sleep could have an effect on your cardiovascular health and insulin resistance. Related: What Happens to Your Body When You Get a Good Night's Sleep According to the study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, light exposure during sleep could heighten your risk for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Ambient light from parted curtains, open blinds or an overhead light or lamp can activate your autonomic nervous system, which cues your heart to beat faster and make you more alert, even as you sleep. ""That's bad,"" co-lead author Daniela Grimaldi, M.D., Ph.D., explained in a media release. ""Usually, your heart rate together with other cardiovascular parameters are lower at night and higher during the day."" The researchers found that when participants were exposed to a lit room, they experienced insulin resistance the next day. Insulin resistance occurs when cells don't respond well to insulin and as a result, those cells can't take in and use glucose for energy as efficiently. Because of this, that excess glucose remains in your bloodstream, causing your blood sugar levels to go up. Having high blood sugar levels overtime can increase your risk for things like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Related: Sleep Might Be the Reason You're Not Losing Weight And while you probably don't leave on all the lights when you sleep, exposure to artificial light at night is pretty common for some folks. If you live in a city, open blinds may bring in ambient light from street lights, car headlights and other sources. And if you fall asleep with your television or bedside lamp on, you could end up feeling those negative effects. Phyllis Zee, M.D. Ph.D., chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician, shared a few tips for avoiding the negative impact of ambient light in a release from Northwestern. First, don't leave the lights on while you're sleeping. While a completely dark room might be a safety concern for some folks, you'll be better off using a nightlight or two to make the floor easier to navigate. You'll also want to avoid blue light while sleeping. Warmer colors, like orange, red and amber, will stimulate your brain less. Consider buying warm bulbs for lights that you must have on at night, and if you're using your phone in bed next to a sleeping person, keep that light away from them. (Or try putting your phone far away before bedtime—using your smartphone before you go to sleep can mess with your metabolism, according to research.) Related: 5 Foods That Could Negatively Impact Your Sleep If you can't avoid light while you sleep, consider buying a comfortable eye mask that will block out the light for you—it's an affordable solution for those with excess light coming in through windows, though blackout curtains would also do the trick. ""These findings are important particularly for those living in modern societies where exposure to indoor and outdoor nighttime light is increasingly widespread,"" Zee said in the release. ""If you're able to see things really well, it's probably too light."" For the most restful night's sleep, turn off all lights and close your blinds before bed. If you can't get rid of all the light in your sleeping area, use blackout curtains or a sleeping mask to avoid having too much ambient light in your room as you sleep. Since that light can cause your heart to race and inhibit your insulin regulation, a dark room could help limit your risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes—and help you sleep more soundly, too. If you need a little help falling asleep, use this list of sleep-friendly foods as inspiration the next time you need a midnight snack—and be sure to incorporate some of these nutrients for better sleep into your routine.",Health/Eating Well,"Doing This Before Bed Could Lower Your Risk for Heart Disease and Diabetes, New Research Says",https://news.yahoo.com/doing-bed-could-lower-risk-194003533.html
3/19/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s interior minister said Friday that it will take years to defuse unexploded ordnances after the Russian invasion. Speaking to The Associated Press in the besieged Ukrainian capital, Denys Monastyrsky said that the country will need Western assistance to cope with the massive task once the war is over. “A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven’t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Monastyrsky said. “It will take years, not months, to defuse them.” In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them. “We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Monastyrsky told the AP. He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there's a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling. ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — Russia has attacked the outskirts of the western city of Lviv, a crossroads for people fleeing the war and for others entering to deliver aid or fight. — President Vladimir Putin appeared at a huge patriotic rally in Moscow and praised the Russian military — President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping spoke as the White House looks to deter Beijing from providing assistance to Russia. — Rescuers search for survivors at a Mariupol theater hit by Russian airstrike; 130 rescued, hundreds still missing — An estimated 6.5 million people have been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million who have already fled the country — Go to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for more coverage ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS TODAY: UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s first deputy U.N. ambassador says Twitter has blocked his account, accusing him of “abuse and harassment,” due to a tweet about the maternity hospital in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. “This is very deplorable,” Dmitry Polyansky told reporters after a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, “and this clearly illustrates how much alternative view and free press, and free information is valued by Twitter and in this country.” Polyansky, who had more than 22,000 followers and was a prolific Twitter user, said he received a message earlier Friday from Twitter’s cloud service saying he was violating Twitter’s rules and was “engaged in abuse and harassment.” He said Twitter referred to his warning in a tweet on March 7 “that the hospital in Mariupol had been turned into a military object by radicals. Very disturbing that UN spreads disinformation without verification.” Associated Press journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the March 10 attack on the maternity hospital and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried. ___ PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to lift the siege of Mariupol, allow humanitarian access and order an immediate cease-fire, Macron’s office said. Macron spoke with the Russian leader on the phone for 70 minutes. Earlier in the day, Putin had a conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also pressed for an immediate cease-fire. Macron, who has spoken numerous times with Putin, revisited complaints over repeated attacks on civilians and Russia’s failure to respect human rights in Ukraine, the presidential Elysee Palace said. It said that Putin, in turn, laid the blame for the war on Ukraine. Macron, who is campaigning to renew his mandate in April elections, said during a town hall-style meeting shortly before the call that he talks to Putin because he believes there is a way toward peace, between the Ukrainian resistance, tough Western sanctions and diplomatic pressure. “We must do everything to find it,” he said. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian officer in charge of defending the region around the country’s capital says his forces are well positioned to defend the city. Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk said in an interview with The Associated Press that “the enemy is halted,” adding that “we are improving this system of defensive lines” to make Kyiv “inapproachable for the enemy.” Despite three weeks of Russian bombardment, Ukraine has kept up a stiff defense of its cities. Fighting continued in Kyiv’s suburbs, depriving thousands of heat and clean water. “From time to time, the enemy tests our defenses,” said Pavlyuk, a battle-hardened officer who earned his rank by leading Ukrainian troops in the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted in 2014. “But our boys are strong in their positions and also play an active role in preventing the enemy to fulfill their plans.” Pavlyuk, who has been put in charge of Kyiv’s defenses earlier this week, said that the Russians are using the same tactics as they used in the east to target civilian structures to try to break Ukraine’s resistance. “That’s why now that war has been transformed into killing civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure, to frighten our people to the maximum,” he said. “But we will never give up. We will fight until the end. To the last breath and to the last bullet.” ___ UNITED NATIONS — Six Western nations have accused Russia of using the U.N. Security Council to launder disinformation, spread propaganda, and justify its unprovoked attack on Ukraine. And the U.S. is again warning that Moscow’s claim that the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine “is really a potential false flag effort in action.” Friday’s council meeting was supposed to be for a vote on Russia’s draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine which has been widely criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor. Russia instead raised allegations again of U.S. involvement in biological warfare activities, which have been repeatedly denied by both the United States and Ukraine. The six Western nations — U.S., U.K., France, Albania, Ireland and Norway — delivered a joint statement just before the council session, saying: “This meeting and these lies are designed for one purpose, to deflect responsibility for Russia’s war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused.” They stressed that Russia has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law and has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons — not Ukraine. “There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories — not near Russia’s border, not anywhere,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. Reiterating the Biden administration’s serious concern of a potential false flag effort, the U.S. envoy said, “We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.” ___ MOSCOW — The head of the Russian delegation in talks with Ukrainian officials says the parties have come closer to an agreement on a neutral status for Ukraine. Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian negotiators in several rounds of talks with Ukraine, including this week, said Friday that the sides have narrowed their differences on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting a neutral status. “The issue of neutral status and no NATO membership for Ukraine is one of the key issues in talks, and that is the issue where the parties have made their positions maximally close,” Medinsky said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies. He added that the sides are now “half-way” on issues regarding the demilitarization of Ukraine. Medinsky noted that while Kyiv insists that Russia-backed separatist regions in Ukraine’s east must be brought back into the fold, Russia believes that people of the regions must be allowed to determine their fate themselves. Medinsky noted that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is possible after the negotiators finalize a draft treaty to end the hostilities and it receives a preliminary approval by the countries’ governments. Medinsky also bristled at a recent statement by Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskyy, who called for disrupting railway links to supply Russian troops in Ukraine, saying it could undermine the talks. ___ LVIV, Ukraine — The president of Belarus, who has allowed Russia to use his country's territory to invade Ukraine, says he has no intention to host Russian nuclear weapons. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has beefed up military ties with Moscow after Western sanctions over his crackdown on protests after his reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West rejected as rigged. He has Lukashenko had previously offered to host Russian nuclear weapons, but in an interview with Japanese broadcaster TBS released by his office on Friday, he said he has no such plans. “I’m not planning to deploy nuclear weapons here, produce nuclear weapons here, create and use nuclear weapons against anyone,” he said, dismissing the allegations of such plans as an “invention by the West.” Lukashenko said that he had made an earlier statement about a possible deployment of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus in response to the talk in the West about a possible redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Germany to Poland. The Belarusian leader noted that the constitutional amendments approved in a vote last month that shed Belarus’ neutral status has no relation to nuclear weapons. ___ GENEVA — The U.N. migration agency estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country. The estimates from the International Organization for Migration suggests Ukraine is fast on a course in just three weeks toward the levels of displacement from Syria’s devastating war – which has driven about 13 million people from their homes both in the country and abroad. The findings come in a paper issued Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It cited the IOM figures as “a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine — calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16.” ___ WASHINGTON — There have been no indications that Russia is moving troops out of Syria to bolster its forces in Ukraine, or that any more than a few Syrian fighters have been recruited to join the war, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East said Friday. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters that he has seen little change in Russian military activities in Syria. And he added that the U.S. military still has and uses a deconfliction phone line with the Russians in Syria, in contrast to the mixed success the U.S. has had in maintaining such contact in connection with the Ukraine war. “We can always contact them if we have a problem. They’ll always pick up the phone, and we feel that we respond in kind to them,” said McKenzie about the Russians, whose forces in Syria support the regime of President Bashar Assad. “That relationship has been very, very professional.” McKenzie, who is retiring after three years at the head of U.S. Central Command, said he also has seen no indication that Russia is moving any troops or assets from Syria or central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, to Ukraine. And he said he also has seen no evidence that “the temperature is rising” between Russia and the U.S. in Syria as a result of the Ukraine war. ___ LONDON — Britain’s defense intelligence chief says Russia is shifting to a ”strategy of attrition” after failing to reach its goals in the invasion of Ukraine. Chief of Defense Intelligence Lt. Gen. Jim Hockenhull says Russian forces have changed their approach after failing to take major Ukrainian cities during the three-week invasion. He said Friday that the battle of attrition “will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.” Western officials say Russian forces have enough artillery ammunition to keep up the bombardments for weeks or even longer. Despite the fact that there have been thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties, Russia denies targeting civilians during what it calls a special military operation in Ukraine. ___ ROME — For the second time this week, Italy’s financial police have carried out measures to freeze luxurious assets of Russian magnates being sanctioned by the European Union for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The latest action on Friday involved the seaside villa, valued at some 105 million euros ($116 million) and located in the Sardinian town of Portisco, belonging to Alexei Mordaschov, a steel baron, the Italian government said. Just a few days earlier, a sprawling real estate complex on Sardinia’s coast belonging to Petr Aven, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sequestered. A yacht moored off the Italian Riviera and belonging to Mordaschov was sequestered earlier this month by Italian authorities. That vessel is valued at 27 million euros ($30 million). ___ ATLANTA — NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on Friday played down recent comments by the head of Russia’s space agency that the United States would have to use broomsticks to fly to space after Russia said it would stop supplying rocket engines to U.S. companies. “That’s just Dmitry Rogozin. He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us,” Nelson told The Associated Press. “The other people that work in the Russian civilian space program, they’re professional. They don’t miss a beat with us, American astronauts and American mission control.” The war has resulted in canceled spacecraft launches and broken contracts, and many worry Rogozin is putting decades of a peaceful off-planet partnership at risk, most notably at the International Space Station. NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is due to leave the International Space Station with two Russians aboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on March 30. NASA has said Vande Hei’s homecoming plans remain unchanged. ___ WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping spoke Friday for nearly two hours via a video call as the White House looks to deter Beijing from providing military or economic assistance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China’s Foreign Ministry was the first to issue a readout of the conversation, deploring “conflict and confrontation” as “not in anyone’s interest,” without assigning any blame to Russia. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in a Twitter message called the U.S. position “overbearing.” Ahead of the call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion. ___ LVIV, Ukraine — Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show the Russian strike on the Lviv airport Friday destroyed the repair hangar just to the west of the north end of its runway. Firetrucks stood parked amid the rubble. A row of fighter jets near the hangar appeared intact, though an apparent impact crater sat right in front of them. Two other buildings nearby the hangar also appear to have taken direct hits in the strike, with debris littered around them. The early morning attack on Lviv’s edge was the closest strike yet to the center of the city, which has become a crossroads for people fleeing from other parts of Ukraine and for others entering to deliver aid or fight. The war has swelled Lviv’s population by some 200,000. ___ BERLIN — Switzerland is adopting the latest round of European Union sanctions against Russia targeting luxury goods and banning rating agencies from working with Russian clients. The Swiss government said Friday that it will echo the EU’s fourth package of sanctions imposed on Russia following its attack on Ukraine. It said that “the ban on the export of luxury goods contained in the new sanctions affects only a small portion of Switzerland’s global exports of such goods.” However, it said that “specific companies could be seriously affected,” without naming them. Unlike the EU and the United States, Switzerland has not yet decided whether to remove Russia from its list of “most favored” trading partners. ___ MARIUPOL, Ukraine — Officials say 130 people have been rescued from the ruins of a theater that served as a shelter when it was blasted by a Russian airstrike Wednesday in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. Ludmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s human rights commissioner, said Friday that 130 people had survived the theater bombing. “As of now, we know that 130 people have been evacuated, but according to our data, there are still more than 1,300 people in these basements, in this bomb shelter,” Denisova told Ukrainian television. “We pray that they will all be alive, but so far there is no information about them.” ___ ATHENS, Greece — Greece’s prime minister is offering to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol that was bombed by Russian forces last week. Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted Friday that “Greece is ready to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol, the center of the Greek minority in Ukraine.” Some 100,000 people of Greek origin were living in the besieged city before the Russian invasion. Mitsotakis called Mariupol “a city dear to our hearts and symbol of the barbarity of the war.” Associated Press journalists documented the attack and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried. ___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The Finnish government has begun posting information in Russian about the invasion of Ukraine. “We ... want to provide Russian speakers with fact-based information from the authorities,” the Finnish government tweeted Friday. The move comes in the face of a Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign that aims to strengthen domestic support for the invasion and undermine the resolve of Ukrainians. The website of the Finnish government is available in Finnish and Swedish — the Nordic country’s two official languages — and in English. ___ President Vladimir Putin appeared at a huge patriotic rally Friday at a Moscow stadium on the eighth anniversary of the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. Putin, speaking to a crowd of tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at the Luzhniki Stadium, praised the Russian military for its actions in Ukraine. “Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other,” Putin said in a rare public appearance. “We have not had unity like this for a long time,” he added to cheers from the crowd. Before Putin spoke, bands played patriotic Soviet songs about national identity and speakers praised Putin as fighting “Nazism” in Ukraine, a claim flatly rejected by leaders across the globe. Some people, including presenters at the event, wore T-shirts or jackets with a “Z” — a symbol seen on Russian tanks and military vehicles in Ukraine and embraced by supporters of the war. ___ ROME — Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine. He is calling for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and were “defending their land.” Francis’ comments, in a message Friday to a gathering of European Catholic representatives, marked some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia’s invasion. It came just days after Francis told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, that the concept of a “just war” was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace, not politics.",World/Associated Press,Live updates: Ukraine says it'll take years to defuse mines,https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-mayor-reports-several-071636807.html
