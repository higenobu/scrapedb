3/10/2022,"Achill wind makes my face feel tight as I walk uphill to the long, narrow wood leading to Keenley. Once under the Scots pines, I look up at their swaying red trunks and dark needles against a deceptively blue sky. The wind is thrashing in the treetops, but down here it’s sheltered and calm. A thin path wiggles up between glossy-leaved hollies and arching brambles. Underfoot, there’s a mass of debris from the winter storms: sticks, cones and large limbs. Emerging honeysuckle leaves scrawl over the decaying branches of previous gales, the rotting wood now supporting mosses, fungi and the unfurling fresh green of dog’s mercury. The weather today is confusing. In the sunlit field outside are sheep fat with lamb, yet tiny snowflakes are falling gently like dust motes through the trees. They drift on to echoing white, as snowdrops, elegant singles or blowsy doubles, swoop up and down the undulating woodland floor. They have pushed up through chaotic nettle stalks, through twisting brown fallen leaves, between stones and ferns, in a massed dangle of clear white petals and sweet scent. A large patch of moss shines vivid emerald where the light falls on it. This waved silk-moss, Plagiothecium undulatum, spreads over the acidic soil beneath the pines, its flattened spear-shaped stems forming rhythmic patterns like a shaggy rug. Just above the wood stands Keenley Methodist chapel. It’s a simple stone building in a grass clearing, ringed by goblet-shaped yews and tall beeches. A narrow flagstone path leads to the brown painted door with a date of 1750 inset into the stone in lead. Above is a carved sign: “Wesleyan Chapel rebuilt 1874”. This modest building is the oldest Methodist church still in use in the world. John Wesley travelled through the North Pennines in 1761 and preached here beneath a sycamore tree. As a result, many local miners and subsistence farmers embraced Methodism. The nearby Isaac’s Tea Trail – named after a 19th-century itinerant tea seller and philanthropist – follows the footpath that led me up here.

3/10/2022,"Global mining company Rio Tinto says it is severing its ties with Russia, throwing into doubt an aluminium joint venture between it and Rusal, which was founded by oligarch Oleg Deripaska. In a one-line statement, Rio Tinto said it was “in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business”. A spokesperson said Rio is reviewing its joint venture with Rusal in Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL), which runs an alumina refinery in Gladstone. The decision creates a fuel supply problem for Rio’s Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia, which relies on Russian diesel. It comes as more western businesses turn their backs on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, with Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other big brands joining the rush for the exit in the past 24 hours, amid sanctions that have laid waste to large sections of the Russian economy. QAL is 80% owned by Rio and 20% by Rusal, where Deripaska continues to hold a stake through their London-listed parent company, EN+ Group. Deripaska and EN+ were among the oligarchs and companies sanctioned in 2018 by the US government over issues including the invasion of Crimea in 2014. Activist investors, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), welcomed the decision by Rio and another Australian company, engineering group Worley, to pull out of Russia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We look forward to seeing more detail about the implications for Rio Tinto’s Queensland Alumina joint venture,” ACCR’s director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said. “Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, all Australian companies should sever relationships with companies owned or part-owned by oligarchs aligned with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “Rio Tinto and Worley should be commended for taking appropriate action.” In a statement to the Australian stock exchange, Worley said it had “begun the safe withdrawal of its services provided in and into Russia and will not enter into new contracts”. The decision will not have a material impact on Worley’s global business, the company said.",News/Business,Rio Tinto to sever ties with Russian businesses over Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/rio-tinto-to-sever-ties-with-russian-businesses-over-ukraine-war
3/10/2022,"“Nobody is likely to take this oddball camp exercise seriously …” the New York Times wrote of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s first season back in 1997, 25 long years ago. This attitude to the horror-comedy-romance-drama, about a teenage girl who is destined to save the world from the forces of darkness, was not uncommon 25 years ago. Most early critics tended to treat Buffy like either an oddity or a joke; Variety deemed it “an uneasy cross between The X-Files and Clueless”. But the show’s poppy, slangy, valley-girl dialogue soon became indicative of everything from low-brow trash to moral bankruptcy; US conservatives used Buffy as moral panic fodder, for apparently depicting witchcraft, occultism and satanism. These days, Buffy is widely regarded as iconic, a cult favourite that has become a darling of streaming services. Its legacy is now confirmed, having spawned egregious “paranormal high school” type shows, inspired a snappier kind of teen speech (“If the apocalypse comes, beep me!”) and slang terms still used today. (“Wigging out” or “What’s the sitch?”) There’s even a much-anticipated reboot coming, rumoured for release this year. But in retrospect, it shouldn’t be surprising that Buffy has lasted the distance for 25 years – it’s a show all about resilience. The first episode opens with a classic horror scene: a tremulous schoolgirl exploring a high school with a boy at night. The nineties was the peak era of slasher horror, packed with gory teen deaths. Instead, in a typical Buffy inversion, the girl’s face ripples (badly – the early graphics are one thing which didn’t stand the test of time) and we discover that she’s the lurking monster. She’s the danger, but more importantly, she’s the one with the power. Buffy is a show about strength: who has it, and who doesn’t. Buffy herself is a regular teen girl, concerned with boys and clothes and friends – who also has the superhuman strength to fight vampires. Her high school is literally hell – for the first three seasons, the school squats over a “hellmouth”, or portal to hell, with the majority of supernatural occurrences, vampire attacks, and other calamities happening on campus. It’s a metaphor that obviously appeals to anyone at school, or who can remember the torture of it. But Buffy’s strength is not just physical, or reserved for defeating vampires – she’s resilient and plucky, useful qualities for getting through something as horrific as high school. Or surviving the literal apocalypse – and not just once. “When I saw you stop the world from, you know, ending, I just assumed that was a big week for you. It turns out I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse,” says Riley, the dopiest of Buffy’s boyfriends. None of Buffy’s characters stay the same over the show’s seven seasons. The innocence of the early episodes is stripped away as they are put through multiple world-ending calamities, often brutally. One of Buffy’s closest friends, Willow, goes from gawky school girl to a powerful and vengeful witch who literally flays a men’s rights activist, and almost ends the world herself. (She also comes out as a lesbian, which is neither here nor there.) Xander, a rare character with no superpowers, is initially resentful when Buffy rejects his advances, but grows up and remains a loyal friend. (And then has his eye gouged out by an evil priest.) But even when Buffy has to murder her own boyfriend, or dies twice herself, the show still makes sure to entertain us. There is silliness in Buffy, and a commitment to humour, manifested in the dialogue, that makes it so infinitely re-watchable and comforting, 25 years later. The comedy is often broad: from ridiculous episodes such as Beer Bad, where a magical beer turns Buffy into a Neanderthal, to more subtle moments of wit interspersed with the horror, drama and action. The infamous musical episode, Once More With Feeling, is not filler or a sign of a tired writers room; every song and dance number, even the hilarious ones, help develop the plot of the narrative arcs of that season. Every witty quip is an expression of a character’s fortitude, every weird scene played for laughs is a moment of release. “If the world doesn’t end,” Buffy’s frenemy Cordelia says, “I’m going to need a note.” Anyone who grew up watching Buffy must also feel as if they have also gone through multiple apocalypses: since the show began, millennials have lived through all sorts of disasters. But Buffy also showed that apocalypses can be personal; along with calamities of the supernatural flavour, there’s also the horror of simply being alive, of surviving. One of the show’s most devastating episodes, The Body, sees Buffy’s mum, Joyce, suddenly die of natural causes. And perhaps it is the show’s depiction of female strength that can explain why so many fans are still sticking with Buffy after the show’s own doomsday, after allegations of bullying and abusive behaviour by the show’s creator Joss Whedon towards some of the female actors on set. (Whedon has denied the allegations.) The news was a twist worthy of Buffy itself: the nice guy who could be a monster. For some fans, Whedon’s alleged conduct has soured the show irrevocably, which is understandable. For others, it’s a disappointment they’ll try to live with, maybe just the latest of many.As Buffy says in the final season: “This is how many apocalypses for us now?” “Oh, uh, six at least. Feels like a hundred,” answers Giles.

3/10/2022,"As the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, picked up the phone to Vladimir Putin this week – the latest in several phone calls between the two leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine – he put forward a suggestion. Modi’s push, according to an Indian government statement, was that Putin should have a “direct conversation” with the Ukrainian prime minister, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in order to “greatly assist ongoing peace efforts”. It was the latest signal from India that while it has refused publicly to condemn Russia’s violent and merciless actions in Ukraine, it might not approve of them. Since Putin embarked on his invasion of Ukraine, much criticism has been directed at India for its refusal to openly repudiate Russia. India has abstained in multiple UN security council votes against Russia’s actions, isolating it from the west, and in statements it has made vague references to the need for dialogue, diplomacy and respect for territorial integrity, without ever naming Russia directly. To many, this is tacit approval for Putin from a country that has been an unwavering ally since before the cold war. But for those familiar with India’s diplomatic history and traditions, the picture is far less black and white. “India has never named names, as far as its allies are concerned,” said Avinash Paliwal, the deputy director of Soas’s South Asia Institute. “But India’s displeasure with Moscow is visible in how they are dealing with the Ukrainians, visible in the statements it is making at the UN, and visible in their repeated calls for a de-escalation of violence.” Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has certainly put India – which considers both Russia and the US to be close and vital allies – in a difficult position, evident in the cautious diplomatic tightrope it has been walking the past few weeks. There is, as Paliwal described it, a “historical hangover” in favour of Russia in India which dates back to the USSR and its support for India in the bloody Bangladesh war in 1971. The Indo-Russian relationship has continued to be nurtured by successive prime ministers (Modi and Putin met as recently as December) and, most crucially for India, Russia is its biggest supplier of weapons, with between 60% and 80% of India’s weapons and defence systems bought from Russia. With India engaged in an ongoing tense military standoff with China along its Himalayan border, where a buildup of troops and weapons continues on both sides, and its relationship with its nuclear-armed neighbour and rival Pakistan remaining testy, India finds itself in no position to jeopardise the flow of defence equipment from Russia. Within India, where sympathy for Russia is still prevalent both in the policymaking corridors of New Delhi and in the wider public consciousness, there is also little pressure for Modi to denounce Russia’s actions. As the conflict broke out, #IStandWithPutin gained significant traction on Indian social media. Yet India has far from publicly taken Russia’s side and, as Syed Akbaruddin, India’s former permanent representative to the UN, pointed out, in its own subtle way, India’s statements around the invasion of Ukraine have increasingly diverged from Russia’s. “Yes, India is abstaining when most of the world is voting against Russians, but in our mind, abstention is absolutely not support,” said Akbaruddin. “This whole action has left us in a space, not of our liking, not of our wanting, so why would we support it.” Akbaruddin said there were “at least four or five” moments in recent weeks where India had increasingly distanced itself from the Russian position, including when they expressed “regret at the outbreak of hostilities”. “Without mentioning Russia’s name, this is our way of condemning the actions of those responsible for the violence,” Akbaruddin said. He also said India had, in an unusual move, outright denied statements made by Putin that Ukrainians had taken Indian students hostage, while also sending several planes of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. This week Modi made phone calls to both Putin and Zelenskiy, and made repeated calls for a diplomatic solution, though India has not yet positioned itself as a mediator in the same vein as Israel or Turkey. India’s other priority, pulling it in the opposite direction, is to protect its flourishing relationships with the US, Europe and the UK. India’s non-defence trade with Russia is only $9bn (£6.8bn), compared with about $100bn with the US, and it has ongoing trade deal negotiations with the UK. Unlike China, Russia’s other significant ally, India has remained silent on the issue of Nato’s expansion. Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that while India’s position on Russia’s invasion had thrown some “turbulence” into the US-India relationship, the White House has been understanding of India’s historical relationship with Russia and its security vulnerabilities vis-a-vis China, and so it was unlikely to disrupt diplomatic ties. Most worrying for India, said Madan, was the increasing closeness between Russia and its foe China, which could have an impact on the choices Moscow makes when its China and India security partnerships are in tension “The true ramifications for India are still being figured out,” said Madan. “But it’s likely there could be some tough decisions ahead.”",News/World news,Narendra Modi walks diplomacy tightrope with Vladimir Putin on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/narendra-modi-walks-diplomacy-tightrope-with-vladimir-putin-on-ukraine
3/10/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine has been hampered by profound logistical failures, the unexpected ferocity of Ukraine’s resistance and an unprecedented sanctions regime that has brought Russia to the brink of economic collapse. Little wonder Putin’s already out rattling sabres and making veiled threats about the prospect of nuclear war. Much was made last week of the Russian dictator’s announcement that strategic nuclear weapons forces had been placed on high alert. The pretext then was “aggressive statements” towards Russia from Nato members. Whether Putin’s threats are serious or hollow, or Ukraine’s nuclear facilities under control or out of it, new generations of humanity are facing a fear that their elders remember too well. The cold war terrors are back, baby, and as the millennial and zoomer generations wig out about atomic incident monitoring and a new reality of “escalation”, it seems ol’ generation X finally has cultural treasure to offer the young. Born between 1965 and 1980, generation X has fewer members than the boomers and millennials either side of us. We arrived when the bright optimism of the early postwar years faded as radioactivity’s brutally transformative, longterm effects were observed. 1958’s UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation reported on infant deaths caused by radiation, and cancers that had bloomed in those downwind to nuclear tests. Generation X teens coming of age in the 1980s also did so in the shadow of a prophesied “nuclear winter”; scientists realised the destruction of atomic war would pump so much soot into the atmosphere that descending cold darkness would cause global crop failure and famine. All this was learned at the height of a cold war, in which Chernobyl was melting down, and the then-Soviet states and the west had literally thousands of warheads pointed at one another. We were just kids – and generationally powerless to do anything about it. They didn’t call gen X the “bleak generation” for nothing. The fear of annihilation saturates the cultural products consumed by gen X as young people. We were given children’s books about nuclear horror - Z for Zachariah, Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes and the devastating graphic novel Where the Wind Blows. They were terrifying - a desperate gambit from the adults who wrote them to frighten us away from making bad decisions in the future we’re living in now. Those seeking empathy for reawakened terror today may wish to revisit tunes like Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Two Tribes, OMD’s droll Enola Gay, or Billy Bragg’s Help Save the Youth of America. Nena’s hit 99 Luftballons ponders geopolitical tensions so delicate they might only take some loose balloons to provoke nuclear conflagration. The 1987 novelty dance hit Walk the Dinosaur is an ironic warning about bombing ourselves back to the stone age. And the eternal prom anthem Forever Young is really a German lament about preferring to die rather than live under perpetual clouds of nuclear-armed anxiety, waiting out Armageddon. Australia didn’t have the proximity of our European or American cousins to the poised warheads, but apocalyptic local films like 1984’s One Night Stand and the Mad Max franchise demonstrate they remained pointed at our minds. These join a genre of nuclear horror best exemplified by 1983 US film The Day After and 1984’s British drama Threads. The first was watched by 100 million Americans, US president Ronald Reagan, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and subsequently the TV audience of the Soviet Union. Reagan himself reportedly credited The Day After as inspiring him to sign the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Gorbachev in 1987, which greatly reduced the superpowers’ nuclear arsenal. The film posits a best-case nuclear conflict scenario, where the survivors of a nuclear blast in Kansas suffer greatly and take several painful days to die. Threads is more horrific because some of its protagonists survive, emerging from the fallout shelters into a cold, dark and hungry world where hope itself has been exterminated. The show is now recognised as a masterpiece and an “unforgettable lesson in true horror”, and online activists suggest viewings be arranged for Putin. Would he be moved? Probably not. And yet the generation who saw it first are no longer powerless. In our 40s and 50s now, gen Xers are in senior positions of influence and command worldwide. The fate of the war in Ukraine – and the world – may yet depend on how much the bleak generation remembers of its childhood fears.
