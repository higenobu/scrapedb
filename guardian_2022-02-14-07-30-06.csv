2/14/2022,"Nick J Fuentes, the 23-year-old founder of the America First Foundation, wants there to be no more immigration to the US. “White men founded this country. It wouldn’t exist without white men and white men are done being bullied … Genocide is being perpetrated against the white man.” He thinks women should stay in the home. “They have been convinced it’s dignified to abandon your children – literally out of their womb – and go work in an office, go work for a corporation. How sick is that?” He thinks they shouldn’t have the vote either, “but that’s probably not going to land soon”. Articulate, charismatic and convincing, he has built a substantial following, beginning with the online gaming community, and now, spreading outward from there, holds his own rallies. He also wants to be president. The most terrifying part of this opening episode of Louis Theroux’s new three-part documentary series, Forbidden America (BBC Two), is that by the end of it you can see no reason why he could not be. Theroux’s latest outing is – for all the compelling interviews that abound – really about the tentacular reach and spectacular, unprecedented power of the internet (alongside whatever else it has brought us); its ability to politicise, radicalise, give voice to would-be demagogues and hatemongers who would once have had their influence naturally curtailed by time and distance, encourage the worst in humanity and then unite people on that basis.  Theroux – more carefully and slightly more forcefully than usual – interviews Fuentes and other prominent figures of the latest incarnation of the far right in the US at length. It builds, as the best of his work does, into a vision of the whole that is more revelatory even than its individual parts. And when the individual parts are as forthcoming as the likes of Fuentes, Anthime Gionet (more commonly known as livestreamer and self-described internet troll Baked Alaska) and Beardson Beardly (real name Matt Evans, and considered by the movement to be Fuentes’ “general”), that’s some bar to hit. There is a maelstrom of sentiments such as: “You think [immigrants] really like white people? They want to kill you”; “Stop acting like a Black woman. Black women are obnoxious”; and “Brittany, if I ever see you, I’m gonna rape you in person”. Combined with footage of anti-semitic chanting, signs emerge of the group coalescing round certain valuable – to them – goals. Moving the window of acceptable political discourse is one of them, so they flinch at any suggestion from Theroux that they are white nationalists or neo-Nazis. Far right? “Probably, yes,” says Baked Alaska. Because, he explains, white people should stand up for themselves and the US should stay majority white, but he doesn’t support slavery. Beardson Beardly twice gave something that looked indistinguishable from a Nazi salute as he left a rally with Fuentes but “I’m not a white nationalist … I’m a gamer”. They still have work to do on themselves and their comms. When Theroux pushes them on their far-right politics, they almost always retreat first behind humour (there’s a reason “irony-bros” has become a recognised term), then become defensive, verbally abusive and frequently take to their shows or YouTube channels to denounce him as a “pretentious” member of the mainstream media with “a gay agenda” and so on. But if they are individually fragile, together they are increasingly strong. Which is, one presumes, a large part of the attraction. Ever since Theroux in effect made the Westboro Baptist Church famous – on his most recent visit, he met people who had been prompted to join the notoriously and aggressively homophobic sect after they saw his documentary about it – the question of whether he (or anyone) should be drawing attention to extremists and potentially giving them access to new audiences has been particularly pertinent. For my money, in the case of the far-right movement (or the rise of neo-fascism, or whatever else you want to call it, depending on how gay your agenda is, I suppose), increasing general public awareness of how it’s gaining ground – and Theroux gave more context and analysis to his interviewees’ practices than usual here – and how far it has got, is likely to do more good than harm. But maybe “likely” is doing too much work there. When Theroux interviewed Brittany Venti, one of the rare women involved in the bros’ work and the recipient of the above rape threat, she said she had assumed most of what they said was tongue-in-cheek. But when they turned on her, she realised the misogyny (“They say all women are whores”) was real rather than ironic. She has not yet extrapolated further, still making light of anti-semitic footage and although mixed race herself, apparently unperturbed from the beginning by the racism that is central to the cause. It makes the question of whether documentary-makers should amplify the far right’s message both harder – and more pressing.",Arts/Television & radio,Louis Theroux’s Forbidden America review – a terrifying meeting with the new far right,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/13/louis-therouxs-forbidden-america-review-a-terrifying-meeting-with-the-new-far-right
2/14/2022,"Afly-half is the centre of attention at the best of times, but this match – more than most – was a tale of two 10s. We didn’t have to go far before the analyses of the showdown between Dan Biggar and Finn Russell. Sure enough, theirs were the narratives that shaped the match. In the end, the earthier qualities for which Biggar is renowned prevailed over the airy brilliance of Russell. In his 100th Test, Wales’s captain shook off the knee injury that dogged him throughout and stepped into the limelight once more to land a winning drop goal 10 minutes from the end.  Ryan Elias was the official man of the match, but he was only too happy to defer to his captain afterwards. “He took a knock early doors,” the Wales hooker said. “I thought the way he was rolling around he could be going off. It’s just a testament to the bloke he is and the player he is. He’s so resilient. You’d have to carry him off in a box, I think, before he gets substituted. He had a great game. That aerial pressure, I thought he was class again today.” The irony is the match’s turning point, the moment the fates of Biggar and Russell separated, of Wales and Scotland, was a miss by Biggar. Each fly-half had missed a conversion in the first half from out wide, but they had not missed a penalty between them, both four from four, when Biggar tried his luck from long range. His attempt hit the crossbar and rebounded back into play. Alex Cuthbert secured it, and in the passage of play that followed Russell knocked the ball on in an attempt to intercept. He was sent to the sin-bin for his pains. Scotland’s soul went with him. With the stage his, Biggar suddenly decided those three points he had tried out for from a suitably dramatic long range were no longer quite so appealing from a much closer position. So he sent the next two penalties to the corner. When the ball came back to him following the second lineout, his instincts for The Moment were triggered. Cardiff had its latest victory against visiting Scots. For Russell, the sure touch of regular victory remains agonisingly elusive, which means it does too for Scotland. For them to be rated favourites in Cardiff represents significant progress, but if ever they might have fancied their chances this would have been it. Not only are they riding as high in rugby’s estimation as they have this century, Wales are missing more than 600 caps’ worth of experience. The wise will point to the hyper-competitiveness of this Six Nations, that barely anything separated these two teams in a match that could have swung either way, just as had been the case when Scotland found the wherewithal to prevail over England the weekend before. If teams are to be capable of beating one another, it stands to reason they each must lose. But in Scotland’s case the laments of the more impetuous are also valid. Stirring victory followed by dispiriting defeat is a pattern all too familiar. Gregor Townsend would not be drawn on the fateful error of his talisman Russell, a player whose genius echoes that of Townsend himself, even if the two have had their disagreements. “We are all aware that in any sports team there are going to be performances that aren’t up there with what we aspire to achieve. But in defeat it is important that we all stay together and work out how we can get better for the following game.” The good news is that Scotland’s next game is back at Murrayfield; the bad news is that France are coming, the only unbeaten team left after only two rounds. Dare one point out that France have not won a Six Nations match in Edinburgh since 2014? They have not beaten Scotland in the championship at all since 2019. The loss of Matt Fagerson in the first half will trouble Townsend, all the more so given Jamie Ritchie is already lost to Scotland’s back row for the rest of the tournament. For Wales, though, there are hopes of a return to action for a few of their wounded. Josh Adams and Willis Halaholo will be in contention, and Taulupe Faletau continues his return from injury with Bath. Josh Navidi, too, may come into the reckoning. Wales have proved better this century at riding the expectations of the watching world – hence their record as the most successful team of the Six Nations. Which is just as well, since their next trip is to Twickenham, the venue they love to storm more than any. “We still have a chance in this competition depending on results, but you want to be in the fight,” said Jonathan Davies, who came on for his 100th cap too. “We go to Twickenham as a group, and we can take some confidence out of today. But we know there’s a huge amount of work to do.” They all still have a chance in this competition. The various tales should provide a few more twists yet.",Sport/Sport,Dan Biggar seizes The Moment in battle of the 10s with Finn Russell ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/13/dan-biggar-seizes-the-moment-in-battle-of-the-10s-with-finn-russell
