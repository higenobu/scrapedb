5/20/2022,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation is failing to address the rising scourge of white supremacist violence despite stark warnings that such attacks pose the greatest domestic terrorism threat in the US, a leading authority on law enforcement has told the Guardian. Michael German, a former FBI special agent who infiltrated white supremacist groups in the 1990s, said the bureau continues to underplay the scope of the threat. As a result, communities targeted by white supremacists and far-right militia groups – such as the largely African American neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed by a suspected racist gunman this week – are left fatally exposed. “US law enforcement is failing, as it long has, to provide victimized communities like Buffalo’s with equal protection under the law. They are not actually investigating the crimes that occur,” said German, a fellow with the Brennan Center at NYU School of Law. Saturday’s mass shooting in Buffalo was allegedly carried out by a white gunman who selected the Tops supermarket because it served one of the largest Black populations in the state. In a 180-page diatribe he is believed to have posted online, he espoused the false racist belief that white Americans are being “replaced” by immigrants of colour. Numerous recent studies have pinpointed white supremacy as the greatest domestic terrorism threat in America today. The FBI itself has sounded the alarm, with its former director Christopher Wray telling Congress in 2020 that “racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists” were the main source of ideological killings, superseding jihadists. In an interview with the Guardian, German said that US law enforcement in general, and the FBI in particular, were lagging behind. Despite a clear mandate from Congress, the bureau has yet to produce statistics revealing the scale of white supremacist crimes. “White supremacists kill far more Americans than anybody else the FBI designates as domestic terrorists, yet the bureau still doesn’t document the crimes and fatalities that occur.” He added: “I think that’s a reflection of lack of concern for the victims of that violence.” The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, put out a statement after Buffalo in which he pledged to seek justice for the innocent victims. He said the justice department (DoJ) would treat the massacre as a “hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism”. In German’s opinion, both these designations – “hate crime” and “racially motivated violent extremism” – are problematic in terms of how they are routinely applied to white supremacist incidents. Most acts that are deemed to be hate crimes are deferred by the DoJ to state and local police for investigation, though 85% of those agencies do not recognize hate crimes as a phenomenon. “Police in these jurisdictions don’t record or may not even investigate hate crimes, so the incident gets lost,” German said. The invisibility of white supremacist hatred to law enforcement is reflected in those official figures that do exist. In recent years, surveys based on the experiences of crime victims themselves have recorded more than 200,000 hate crime incidents each year. Compare that with the average number of hate crime cases prosecuted by the DoJ annually – 21. “Racially motivated violent extremism” is also less than helpful as a designation, German said. Though it is classed as terrorism, it is a catchall in which white supremacy groups are lumped together with Black nationalists and those classified as “Black identity extremists”. The end result is that the spotlight that should be tightly focused on the growing threat of white supremacy is diffused. Federal resources are scattered between animal rights groups, native American protesters, non-violent civil disobedience movements, even pro-abortion groups designated as terrorist entities, though there is no evidence such groups exist. Meanwhile, organized criminal groups dedicated to upholding white power fly largely beneath the radar. There is a dramatic contrast with the overweening surveillance that was aimed at Muslim communities after 9/11, German said. He pointed to the many telltale signs that the Buffalo suspect appears to have offered months before Saturday’s attack. He announced a “murder/suicide” mission at his school that was referred to state police. According to the Washington Post, the matter was dropped after the individual reassured them he had been “joking”. “Can you imagine if the Buffalo shooter had been Muslim, and he was telling his friends he was enamored with Osama bin Laden,” German said. “You have to think the response would have been different.” German said it was puzzling that an institution like the FBI that had effectively turned itself into a counter-terrorism intelligence agency after 9/11 was, by contrast, so lax in its handling of white supremacy. One factor, he said, was that the FBI displays the prejudices of American society writ large: “we fail to recognize how foundational white supremacism is to our culture,” he said. FBI agents are also overwhelmingly white and male, and the bureau has been infused with elements of white supremacist ideology stretching back decades. German knows that from personal experience. “When I was going undercover in the 1990s I was warned about sympathy towards white supremacy among officers – that was raised as a hazard for my undercover operation.” In 2006 the FBI drew up an internal intelligence assessment that found that “white supremacist presence among law enforcement personnel is a concern”. It said that organized groups were infiltrating law enforcement agencies, while individuals sympathetic to “white supremacist causes” were also joining the ranks. That was 16 years ago. To this day there has been no national effort to root out the infection. “If there had been an internal FBI report that Isis had infiltrated US law enforcement, you’d expect a nationwide attempt to get to the bottom of it,” German said. Given the devastating nature of the Buffalo shootings – and Joe Biden’s promise to the victims’ families that “hate will not prevail” – the DoJ is likely to devote resources to this particular investigation. But German warns that the underlying tendency to under-record and underestimate the scope of white supremacist criminal activity shows no sign of changing. What does that do to people of color who are the targets of all the hatred? “It creates a recognition for these communities that they have to solve their own problems. They know that law enforcement, the FBI included, treat them harshly when they are suspects and ignore them when they are victims.”",News/US news,"FBI failing to address white supremacist violence, warns former special agent",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/fbi-white-supremacist-violence-michael-german
5/20/2022,"He thinks it’s fine to just give things a quick once over with a dry cloth – but this is pointless My husband of 23 years can’t dust to save his life. We have lived together since we were 27 but I’d never noticed how bad some of his cleaning techniques are until recently. I broke my ankle on a hike a month ago, and now Diarmuid has stepped up to do more of the housework. Dusting just isn’t Diarmuid’s forte. He thinks it is fine to just give things a quick once-over with a dry cloth. I see this as totally pointless and a shortcut to creating more mess – you need to use a damp cloth to dust down items. A damp microfibre cloth is the best option as it attracts all the dust particles, removing them as you go, instead of simply shifting them around the room. But he thinks a dry cloth is perfectly adequate. He was dusting the living room recently with a dry cloth. I could actually see the dust particles flying everywhere. I said: “Do you realise you’re making more work for yourself, Diarmuid?” but he told me he would be vacuuming afterwards so it didn’t make much difference. But when he moved to dust our oakwood dining table, I pointed out that as well as making more mess, dry dusting scratches wooden surfaces; it can chip the finish. He said it wouldn’t make any difference and that I was overreacting. Our table cost £400 and I don’t want it scratched. I normally enjoy dusting and other household chores. As a wife and mother running a house, I have perfected my techniques over the years. My methods are tried and tested. Diarmuid is very stuck in his ways for a novice. He also gets into a bit of a huff when I give instructions, as he’s not used to doing housework. But now I can’t move around that well or put much weight on my ankle, I will have to carry on giving instructions from the armchair for another few months. And Diarmuid should listen to me because I know what I’m talking about. He wants to get a cleaner while I heal but I won’t have that. He just needs to up his dusting game – and make sure he doesn’t scratch anything. I dust first, and then vacuum everything up – why waste time wetting a cloth? I’m a busy man. I don’t think too deeply about the dusting when I know that I’ll be vacuuming and mopping afterwards. It’s efficiency that concerns me. Why waste time wetting a cloth to collect the dust if I’m going to vacuum it up afterwards? It doesn’t make sense. I’ve taken on more of the housework since Maureen injured her ankle. I don’t mind doing it, but I hate being watched and told off as I go. There’s nothing worse than a little voice behind you saying “Not like that” or “You’ve missed a bit”. It’s enough to make anyone snap, which admittedly I have done more than once. Recently I was dusting with a dry cloth, with Maureen instructing me from the sofa. She got very irritated when watching my technique. She nearly started doing the cleaning herself, even though the doctor has told her to rest and not put pressure on her foot. She was upset that I was dry-dusting the expensive wooden table and our bookshelves because she says I could scratch something. I don’t believe this to be true – how can a soft cloth chip or scratch varnished wood? It’s impossible. But I’ve decided I want an easy life, so in future I will refrain from doing that in front of her. Maureen also gets a bit annoyed when I ignore her, but if I’m doing a task, she has to let me get on with it. Maureen is the authority on most housework because she’s always been in charge of it. I’ve worked in banking while she’s been a homemaker. I’m now retired and the kids are living elsewhere. We’ve found ourselves bickering more over small household chores now we are both at home. With Maureen’s injury I’m realising how much time and skill housework actually takes, but dusting just isn’t for me. It’s tedious. I think this could all be sorted if we simply got a cleaner, but Maureen is too proud to pay someone else to do something she’s always done well. When she’s not around I will probably dry-dust some of our items. I will leave the windows open and then vacuum afterwards. I don’t think it’s a big deal. Should Diarmuid do the dusting the way Maureen wants him to? Maureen is guilty. She didn’t notice Diarmuid’s dusting technique until she was forced to sit and watch him, so the result couldn’t have been that bad. Diarmuid, buy one of those anti-static duster thingies.Mo, 74 Diarmuid’s done next to zero housework all these years and now he’s too obstinate to dampen a cloth and unwilling to learn anything from the person who’s diligently cleaned their home all these years. Grow up Diarmuid – and pray you haven’t scratched that table.Charlie, 40 It must be tough for Maureen with a broken ankle, and with them both adjusting to retirement. But Diarmuid isn’t her employee and he may do things differently. Maureen should cut him some slack and stop studying his technique. Or call that cleaner!Sarah, 44 It sounds like Maureen feels that Diarmuid’s cleaning style is undermining the care she’s put into their household over the years. Diarmuid shouldn’t have to do everything her way, but they should sit down and make a plan to divide up the household tasks more fairly once Maureen is back on her feet.Barbara, 30 Maureen has done the cleaning a million times and perfected her technique. Diarmuid should respect that and listen to the expert. Hiring and managing a temporary cleaner would require more time and effort.Hui, 29 So now you can be the judge. In our online poll below, tell us: should Diarmuid adopt Penny’s dusting technique? We’ll share the results on next week’s You be the judge.

5/20/2022,"A head to head between the world champion and the leading pretender to the throne can be a game to savour. Magnus Carlsen and Ding Liren are both playing in the online Chessable Masters, which began on Thursday with an all-play-all of 16, followed next week by a knockout of the top eight. Carlsen and Ding are paired in Sunday evening’s 15th and final all-play-all round, but even if both are already qualified there could still be a battle as Carlsen always wants to be top seeded for the knockout stage. There they would be likely to meet again, either in Tuesday’s semi-finals or in the two-day final on Wednesday and Thursday. After four rounds China’s No 2, Wei Yi, led with three wins and a draw, followed by Carlsen, Ding, and Anish Giri tied for second place. Ding had to play 26 rated games in a hurry last month to ensure he qualified for the Candidates, but he was unbeaten and scored a brilliancy based on a long distance attack. Meanwhile, the four Candidates who played in Bucharest as a warmup all finished in the bottom half. In particular, Alireza Firouzja was unrecognisable as the 18-year-old who wowed the chess world last autumn and became the youngest ever to reach a 2800 rating. The most entertaining match of the week came in Tuesday’s semi-final of the junior speed championship, in which Arjun Erigaisi knocked out Hans Niemann in a fluctuating series of 5/1 blitz, 3/1 blitz, and 1/1 bullet. Both 18-year-olds have been in fine form this year, surging into the world top 100 as the Indian crushed the Wijk masters group while the American won at Havana and Malmö, and their clash was a little like watching Mikhail Tal and Bobby Fischer transported from the 1950s for a speed match. Niemann’s win in the first featured game is especially worth a look. The online Chessable Masters and the over-the-board Warsaw Rapid and Blitz began on Thursday, with a rare appearance by India’s ex-world champion Vishy Anand a highlight in Poland. Anand was in brilliant forn at the start, winning all his three first-day games, including an incisive Advance Variation against Anton Korobov’s French Defence. Thursday was also the opening round of the over-the-board Chessable English Open at Kenilworth, Warwickshire, which, despite first and second prizes of £2000 and £1200, has failed to attract any of England’s elite of six grandmasters rated 2600+. In their absence, a generation clash is on between the GM survivors of the Fischer boom, now in their 50s and 60s, and the rising group of IMs and FMs in their twenties and teens. The English elite have their eyes on a different and ambitious target – a world crown. The World Senior Team Championships for over-50s and over-65s start in Acqui Terme, Italy, on 19 June, with England seeded to capture gold in both events. England over-50s are leaving little to chance, with a team headed by Michael Adams and Nigel Short, supported by John Emms, Mark Hebden and Keith Arkell. England over-65s, led by GM John Nunn, will also be top seeded by a wide margin of rating points. Before the pandemic, the teams to beat were the United States in the over-50s and Russia in the over-65s. Russia are banned this year, while the US squad lacks two of its best players, the Deep Blue mastermind Joel Benjamin and the seasoned Alex Yermolinsky. Double gold might appear a done deal, but in more than one previous version of this championship, England have started as strong favourites yet failed due to narrow defeats against a rival in a crucial match. 3816: 1 Bxe6!

5/20/2022,"The UK government’s independent adviser on tackling violence against women and girls has suggested her calls for street harassment to be made a crime are being blocked. Nimco Ali, a close friend of Boris and Carrie Johnson, told the BBC’s Political Thinking with Nick Robinson that her proposal had experienced “pushback” while hinting the prime minister had not fully supported it. The murder of Sarah Everard, who was abducted while walking home in south London last year, triggered nationwide scrutiny of women’s safety and attitudes towards women. Ali said: “For me, I would specifically love (for) public sexual harassment to become a crime,” she said. “One of the things that I’ve seen is that a department and a secretary of state can have an opinion and then there can be other things (where there is) pushback,” she said, before clarifying the pushback came from “other people”. “And cabinet responsibility is a thing – so that’s why I’m saying ‘as a thing’, it’s not just individual, so I do think that there is at times a very masculined conversation where the government, in how government and institutions work, so we need to be able to address that,” she added. As part of a crackdown launched last year, the government said it would not rule out creating new laws over street harassment, saying: “We are looking carefully at where there may be gaps in existing law and how a specific offence for public sexual harassment could address those.” At the time, Priti Patel, the home secretary, said: “The safety of women and girls across the country, wherever they are, is an absolute priority for me. “It is unacceptable that women and girls are still subject to harassment, abuse, and violence, and I do not accept that violence against women and girls is inevitable. The government also said it would look at whether street design features could help improve personal safety in public, and would also pilot an online tool called StreetSafe, allowing members of the public, anonymously, to highlight locations where they feel particularly vulnerable. The announcement also contained measures including a public campaign “focused on creating behavioural change” that the government hoped would challenge misogyny in society, as well as pledges to ensure police know how to respond effectively to allegations. A government spokesperson told the BBC tackling violence against women and girls remained one of its “top priorities”. “Since July, we have delivered on our commitments, including the first ever national police lead for violence against women and girls, implementing the landmark Domestic Abuse Act and the pilot Safety of Women at Night Fund, along with a further £25m for Safer Streets projects. “In March, the prime minister launched a new £20m business partnership to continue to improve girls’ access to education in developing countries, and the UK has been clear it supports women’s reproductive rights globally, including the right to access safe and legal abortion.”",News/Society,"Street harassment law being blocked, says UK government adviser",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/20/street-harassment-law-being-blocked-says-uk-government-adviser-nimco-ali
5/20/2022,"With the polls tightening in the final days of the campaign, Saturday’s election is expected to be a close match. Labor is desperately hoping the widespread anti-Morrison sentiment will be enough to deliver victory and polls suggest they are in front, but the party is still scarred by the experience of 2019, when polling pointed to an ALP win, only for its advantage to evaporate on the day. For majority government, both parties will be aiming to secure at least 76 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives. Labor holds a notional 69 seats, so needs a net gain of seven seats for a majority, but could form minority government if it wins just five. The Coalition holds only 75 seats after the defection of the United Australia party leader, Craig Kelly, to the crossbench, so also needs to win seats to maintain its majority.

5/20/2022,"Sri and Gopi Hinduja have been named the UK’s richest people, with an estimated £28.5bn fortune – the largest recorded in the 34 years of publication of the Sunday Times rich list. The brothers who run a property-to-industrial conglomerate from London saw their wealth swell by £11.5bn over the past year to put them at the top of the annual wealth ranking ahead of the inventor Sir James Dyson, who is in second place with £23bn. Sri, 86, and Gopi, 82, Hinduja and their extended family own a wide range of industrial and financial businesses and investments based mainly in the UK, India and Switzerland. They are currently transforming the Old War Office building in Whitehall into a Raffles hotel with 120 rooms, 11 restaurants and 85 serviced apartments. As Britons face the biggest cost of living crisis in decades, the number of billionaires in the UK hit a record 177, up six on 2021. The combined wealth of UK billionaires hit £653bn, up £59bn or 9.4%. “While many of us are experiencing the greatest cost of living squeeze we can remember, the super-rich have had another record year,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the list. “This year’s Sunday Times rich list again uncovers record wealth and more billionaires than ever before.” Julia Davies, a founding member of Patriotic Millionaires UK, a group of super-rich people calling for the introduction of a wealth tax, said the list showed an “obscene concentration of wealth while millions struggle with simply living”. She added: “As the Bank of England warns of apocalyptic food price rises, 2 million people are skipping meals, and a third of people can’t afford the essentials. Meanwhile, the rich, as always, are sitting pretty. This disparity has to be fixed. It is political and economic negligence that our politicians are not focused on dealing with the extreme wealth gap at a time of national economic emergency.” Luke Hildyard, an executive director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that focuses on excessive pay, said: “It’s not really efficient or sensible or necessary to run the economy in a way that enables people who are already incredibly wealthy to accumulate even more while much of the population is crushed by a cost of living crisis.“With stagnating wages and miserable economic growth, it’s clear that sharing existing wealth more evenly is the most important political challenge of our time. That means taxing the super-rich more effectively and getting the companies they own and invest in to pay their workers more.” Hildyard calculated that if total household wealth in Great Britain had increased at the same rate as the wealth of the top 20 entrants on the rich list over the past decade, the average household would now have £205,000 more than they currently do. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and his wife, Akshata Murty, were named as the 222nd richest people in the UK, with a combined fortune of £730m. Their entry into the annual wealth ranking follows the revelation last month that Murty had claimed non-dom status to legally not pay tax on annual dividends she receives from a £690m stake in the Indian IT company Infosys, founded by her billionaire father. After mounting public outrage, Murty bowed to pressure to pay UK taxes, saying she realised many people felt her tax arrangements were not “compatible with my husband’s job as chancellor”. Several Russian oligarchs are still featured on the list despite being hit by sanctions after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The estimated fortune of the Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, shrank the most on the list, from £12bn last year to £6bn today, largely because of a steep drop in the value of his shares in the London-listed Russian metals company Evraz. However, he is still the 28th richest person in the UK. “We think our readers will be surprised more of those who have been sanctioned after the invasion of Ukraine haven’t seen a greater hit to their fortunes,” Watt said. “But the reality is there is a world of difference between freezing assets and seizing assets. “Even before the war began, many of these billionaires had shifted their wealth beyond the reach of western authorities.”",News/Business,"Sri and Gopi Hinduja named UK’s richest people, with £28.5bn fortune",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/sri-and-gopi-hinduja-named-uk-richest-people-james-dyson
5/20/2022,"Life behind the iron curtain was an education in a certain kind of humour: dark, unsentimental and absurd. It understood that jokes had become shortcuts to the truth – apart from the bonus of laughter, they turned the wooden language of the regime against itself in ways that sincerity could not. My favourite joke from my time in 1980s Romania was: “Under communism, the future is always certain; it’s the past that keeps changing.” From the vantage point of 2022, it’s clear that this wasn’t just true of communism, and that the joke, if we can still bear to laugh at it, is also on us. Time Shelter is Bulgarian writer Georgi Gospodinov’s third novel, and for all its focus on the apparently bygone, it could not be more timely. A mysterious therapist, Gaustine, founds a clinic that treats patients with Alzheimer’s by recreating the pasts in which they felt most secure. The “past-clinic” begins with different rooms and floors, decorated with a completist’s precision and an obsessive’s eye for detail: particular cigarette brands, lampshades, wallpaper, archive magazines … Decade by decade, therapeutic time-shelters allow patients to inhabit their temporal “safe spaces”. The clinic is not just a place where Gaustine treats patients; it is also the perfect conceit for Gospodinov’s narrator to explore the 20th century in Europe through the vanishing points of traumatised or broken individuals. It’s as if Oliver Sacks and WG Sebald had collaborated on a Europe-wide chain of treatment centres. A former secret policeman arrives with his former quarry, who now has dementia. The police officer has become his prosthetic memory, restoring moments of happiness to the man he once persecuted and informed on. In one of the book’s many dark jokes, a Romanian patient finds solace in remembering not what he experienced but what he fantasised about: a life in the US. Nostalgia is not about what you had, but a memory of what you wanted: a backdated cheque from a nonexistent bank that somehow always pays out. Some patients have memories that are better left untapped: in one harrowing case, Gaustine treats a woman who cannot bear to be near showers. He discovers that she is a Holocaust survivor, prompting him to reflect that memory is not a good in itself, and that the right kind of forgetting is also therapeutically necessary. Gaustine writes that the more past there is, the less memory we have. Differentiating the past from memory becomes important later in the novel, when Gaustine’s idea is hijacked – as it was always going to be – by politicians. The clinic is so successful that clients with no ailments gravitate towards it. Everyone wants a piece of the past. A radio station plays entire days from specific decades. Gaustine imagines towns and cities fixed in particular eras; soon, whole countries want to emulate his idea. Across Europe, political parties promote different decades in their national histories. Referendums are fought on what particular past a country’s future will look like. It’s funny and absurd, but it’s also frightening, because even as Gospodinov plays with the idea as fiction, the reader begins to recognise something rather closer to home. Time Shelter was written between the Brexit referendum and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both of which represent, in their own ways, the weaponisation of nostalgia and the selection of particular eras in the time clinic of the not-so-new world order. The Brexit referendum is invoked here as a prototype (our politicians would say “world-leading”) for the fictional referendums that break out across Europe. In the film that I hope will be made of this novel, I imagine crowd scenes and political rallies with people chanting slogans like, “What do we want? Then! When do we want it? Now!” True to form, Gospodinov finds humour in the bleakness, as Europe proves, yet again, that knowing history is no bar to repeating it. He has fun with national stereotypes: “If Scandinavia couldn’t decide which of its happy periods to choose, Romania was also racked by doubt, but for opposite reasons.” This novel could have been a clever, high-concept intellectual game with little by way of emotional investment, but Gospodinov is a writer of great warmth as well as skill. His narrator bears close relation to Gospodinov himself: a Bulgarian, born in 1968, for whom the end of communism remains, as it remains in a ghostly way in this novel, a meeting point of past and present. His affection for that period is sincere but also without illusion. He can draw out fully dimensional characters from the broken details of their fractured memories. His transitions – between humour and sadness, absurd situationism and reverberating tragedy, pathos and ironic observation – are never obtrusive. Thanks to the skill and delicacy of Angela Rodel’s translation, these qualities are in abundant display for the anglophone reader. The novel’s title – Time Shelter – is a neologism in Bulgarian as it is in English, a grafting from the noun “bomb shelter”. It’s well found in its ambiguity: sheltering from time, and sheltering within time. Both are attractive but impossible. Nostalgia used to feel like a source of harmless escape, and occasional sustenance. It is starting to seem like a fossil fuel, foreshortening our future as it burns.
