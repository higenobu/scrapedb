2/19/2022,"NS&I has doubled the rate of interest it pays on its Green Savings Bond – but the returns still lag the market-leading deals and leave savers’ cash being eroded by inflation. The latest issue of the three-year account from the government-backed savings provider will pay a rate of 1.3%, up from the 0.65% on offer at its launch, which was described by experts at the time as “paltry”.  The account, which is available to anyone over 16, invests in projects to fight climate change, including efforts to make transport greener and increase renewable energy use. Savers can deposit from £100 to £100,000 and are not allowed to withdraw their money after the 30-day initial cooling-off period. Announcing the new rate, the economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said it “reflects upward movement across the wider fixed-term market”. However, experts said the initial deal fell well short of what was on offer elsewhere and was unlikely to attract all but the keenest green savers. The new rate is not the best on the market but it does mean that you do not have to sacrifice too much interest to support environmental projects. If higher returns are your priority, elsewhere you can earn 1.85% on a three-year savings bond from several providers, including Tandem, an app-based account provider that also claims to have environmental credentials. Locking in for only one-year, which may be preferable at a time of rising interest rates, could also be more lucrative, said Anna Bowes of the website Savings Champion. Al Rayan Bank is advertising a return of 1.45% over 12 months – it is an “expected rate” but if the bank adjusts it down you can withdraw your money without penalty. The minimum deposit is £5,000. Across the market the interest on offer is running way below the current rate of inflation. On Wednesday the Office for National Statistics said consumer prices had increased by 5.5% in the year to January. Although the Bank of England base rate has gone up twice in recent months as a result, most savers have not felt the benefit. Bowes said that by this week, banks and building societies had increased rates on fewer than a quarter of accounts, and that in most case this was by less than the 0.4 percentage points of the Bank’s base rate rise. “There are a lot of providers who have made minimal moves to help their customers since the first rate rise in December,” she said. “The high street banks seem to have missed the memo. “It’s a lost cause for savers in terms of keeping up with inflation.” However, rather than sticking with an instant access account that could be paying 0.1%, moving to a fixed-rate bond will at least offset some of the damage being done by rising prices.",Lifestyle/Money,NS&I doubles interest on Green Savings Bond but returns still lag market leaders,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/19/nsi-doubles-interest-on-green-savings-bond-but-returns-still-lag-market-leaders
2/19/2022,"Astatue depicting the angry spirit of a Belgian officer beheaded during an uprising in Congo in 1931 is at the centre of a tug of war between a US museum and a Congolese gallery at the site of the rebellion. The statue of Maximilien Balot, a colonial administrator, has travelled to Europe but the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is accused of stonewalling requests for a loan to the White Cube gallery in Lusanga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  The row has developed into a legal dispute after the White Cube sought to raise funds by selling digital images of the Balot statue – known as non-fungible tokens or NFTs – resulting in accusations from the VMFA of a breach of copyright. A spokesman for the VMFA in Richmond, Virginia, said the “image was lifted directly from the museum’s website without permission, which “violates our open access policy and is unacceptable and unprofessional”. Renzo Martens, a Dutch artist and director at the White Cube, said: “We have downloaded the image from the internet, as there is no other material made available by the VMFA. We do not have copyright for the image, we use it under the doctrine of fair use.” It was during a revolt against the rape of the wives of men who had refused to work at a palm nut plantation in Lusanga that Balot was hacked to death. The brutal Belgian retaliation that followed led to the revolt of the Pende people, one of the last significant rebellions against colonial rule before independence was secured three decades later. A statue was carved of Balot’s angry spirit in an effort to control it, experts say. The statue was purchased in 1972 by Herbert Weiss, an emeritus professor at City University of New York while he was on a field trip near Lusanga, formerly known as Leverville after William Lever, the founder of Unilever. Weiss donated it to the VMFA. The row highlights the tensions between western institutions displaying artefacts dating from the colonial era and the countries from where artistic and cultural works were taken. The VMFA has 300 employees and an annual revenue of $21.3m (£15.6m), while the White Cube was established by former plantation workers and is supported by fund raising by a cooperative of artists known as Congolese Plantation Workers Art League (CATPC). Cedart Tamasala and Matthieu Kasama, two representatives of the CATPC, visited the VMFA in February 2020 where they first asked for a loan of the statue. A documentary-maker travelling with the two men caught the response from their guide, Prof Richard Woodward, a former curator of African art. He told them: “That would be a very interesting possibility to explore to be able to share the work back. As a museum that cares for the preservation of these objects we go through certain formalities about an agreement and shopping and display. You know, conditions of security and things like that.” In subsequent correspondence, assurances were given over the White Cube facility and insurance plans but the VMFA said it was initially unable to positively respond as the statue was already out on loan. According to the chain correspondence, the museum then said in October 2021 that it was too early to make decisions about a loan for 2023. A spokesperson for the VMFA added in a statement that decisions over loaning the sculpture had not been possible last year as the White Cube building, inaugurated in 2017, “was not complete”. Tamasala said bringing back the statue even if only for a loan was an important way for locals to reconnect with their past. He said: “The lost item, the Balot sculpture, was made for the main purpose, to control the spirit of dead Balot, which could wander and harm the Pende or their surroundings. Currently, what role does she play? “It is objectified and classified or imprisoned – a sterile museum with so many objects looted in Africa, with no other purpose than to make money or educate their own population. “We have the strong impression that they are not ready to lend it to us; it can be lent to a museum in Switzerland or elsewhere, but not to a museum in the plantation for the resistance against which, among other things, it was designed and sculpted.”",Arts/Art and design,Row about Congolese statue loan escalates into legal battle over NFTs,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/19/congolese-statue-loan-legal-battle-nfts-colonial-rule-us-museum

2/19/2022,"As the bombshell news of Prince Andrew’s settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre dissipates, the question of who or what the tentacles of the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking conspiracy will envelope next remains. New York attorneys believe it is unlikely any more will be said by the parties involved in Andrew’s case, assuming the senior British royal keeps to the agreed settlement. The letter that accompanied the court filing last week, agreed by both sides, was unusually explicit and calculated to the purpose of settling the matter for good.  “It gave Giuffre something, including recognition that she’d been a victim of sex trafficking, but not everything she wanted, including an admission of guilt,” said the New York lawyer Julie Rendelman. But attention will now return to a slew of other unfinished business stemming from the sex-trafficking ring run by the disgraced financier Epstein, his one-time girlfriend Maxwell and possibly others. Certainly the nature of the circles that Epstein moved in – powerful, elite, famous and wealthy – make continued interest by media and law enforcement inevitable. The loose ends in the Epstein saga include the outcome of challenges to Maxwell’s conviction and her yet-to-be scheduled sentencing over the summer, which will include victims’ impact statements. There is also the question of prosecutors’ appetite to reach down the conspiracy chain and the disposition of about $440m left in Epstein’s estate after $121m was paid out to victims through a compensation fund. Finally, there is potential for a new round of civil claims against those involved in the sex-trafficking conspiracy. But the release of the names of 16 “John Does” – in effect, potential clients of the conspiracy – that were redacted from depositions in Virginia Giuffre’s defamation lawsuit against Maxwell may initially produce little more than headlines. Maxwell, who was returned to Brooklyn’s Metropolitan detention center, where she has been held in isolation since her arrest in July 2020, has said she no longer wishes to fight the release of men’s identities. “Each of the listed Does has counsel who have ably asserted their own respective privacy rights. Ms Maxwell therefore leaves it to this Court to conduct the appropriate review,” her lawyers wrote. “Generalized aversion to embarrassment and negativity … is not enough to warrant continued sealing of information,” Giuffre’s attorney Sigrid McCawley wrote to the court. “There is little reason to retain protection over the vast swaths of information about Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking operation.” It’s up to Judge Loretta Preska, who presided over the Giuffre-Maxwell action, to unseal them. When Preska previously ordered the release of testimony, she said that claims to privacy were “far outweighed by the presumption of public access”. That in turn could lead to a wave of new civil cases, said Professor Marci Hamilton, an expert on child sex abuse statutes of limitations at the University of Pennsylvania and CEO of Child USA, citing a New York City law that allows sex abuse cases outside the normal statute of limitations to be brought. The law goes into effect in September, and opens for cases to be filed in March 2023. “It’s not over for the survivors and we’ll see new lawsuits against Epstein’s co-conspirators – the men who willingly accepted the girls to abuse them, the men who were frequently in his space. As of March, any woman will have her claims revived and be able to sue any and everybody involved in the Epstein system, even if they have received compensation for the Epstein victim’s fund.” Hamilton was involved in advising both the compensation fund and the US Virgin Islands attorney general, Denise George, who filed claims against Epstein’s estate. While most say the fund was administered fairly, the overall amount released by the estate to compensate Epstein’s victims is questioned. “In the end I was disappointed that more women weren’t compensated higher dollars. Reserving so much of it just didn’t seem like a laudable goal,” says Hamilton. Arick Fudali, a lawyer with the Bloom Firm that represented eight women to the fund, said he had mixed feelings. “It was a good opportunity for them to have their voices heard in a non-confrontational way and get some measure of justice. But I think every single penny from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate should have gone to victims, and I fault the program for leaving any money in the estate.” Late last year, the Virgin Islands’ George asked the British bank Barclays to hand over information related to Epstein, days after its former chief executive Jes Staley left the bank over his ties to the financier that included unexplained emails referring to “snow white”. Barclays said it had “complied with its obligations”. These issues have been dragging for years. But, with a saga as sprawling as the Epstein scandal, new wrinkles are constantly appearing. There is now pending, and highly contentious, litigation between the multibillionaire former Apollo CEO Leon Black and his former mistress Guzel Ganieva, who claims she was trafficked to Epstein. Black denies the allegation and has countersued in federal court, claiming that his former business partner, Josh Harris, masterminded a smear campaign in 2021 to “destroy” him. But the question of whether the justice department itself wants to go after others lower down in the Epstein-Maxwell conspiracy – “reaching down”, in prosecutorial terms – remains open. Following Maxwell’s conviction, the government dropped perjury charges against the ex-British socialite and complaints against two detention guards who failed to keep watch over Epstein the night he took his life. Lawyers for members of Epstein’s personal staff, including Sarah Kellen, have indicated Epstein’s staff are not in the frame. “I don’t believe there will be further criminal charges,” said Rendelman. The next criminal aspect of the Epstein conspiracy would then be Maxwell’s sentencing. Maxwell’s defense attorneys will submit a lengthy motion – typically public record – incorporating every positive aspect of Maxwell’s life – lack of criminal record, any time of community service, her family background, mental health. “You name it, they’ll include it in an effort to get the judge to go as low as possible in terms of sentencing guidelines,” said Rendelman. But that assumes her conviction survives expected motions for a mistrial on various grounds, including two jurors saying they had omitted from a pre-trial questionnaire that they had been sexually abused as children and may later have helped shape jury deliberations. If Maxwell seeks to overturn the verdict, or launch an appeal, any cooperation she might offer the government in exchange for a lighter sentence, would probably fail, said David Weinstein, a former assistant US attorney in the southern district of Florida. “It’s always been a practice and policy of the Department of Justice that if you’re pursuing an appeal of your conviction, then we’re not interested in having you cooperate with us because you’re not really cooperating, you’re fighting with us.” On the other hand, if she offered to cooperate against high-value individuals who were equal or only slightly lower down, that might be something the government would be interested in. “Epstein was their big target. Maxwell was their No 2, who became No 1. There may be some high-profile individuals involved, but for the most part they were not necessarily co-conspirators recruiting and providing victims but rather – and for lack of a better word - their services,” Weinstein said. For Andrew, his immediate legal woes are over, even though a horrific PR problem remains. But for others, just maybe, their troubles might be just beginning.",News/US news,"After Andrew, where will tentacles of Epstein case reach next?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-prince-andrew-loose-ends
2/19/2022,"Out-of-date IT systems are causing “chaos” inside the Foreign Office (FCDO) and undermining the government response to the Ukraine crisis, insiders have warned. Problems in the running of the department, which were laid out by a whistleblower in the aftermath of the Afghanistan withdrawal, were still causing “major issues” as the Ukraine crisis deepens, officials told the Guardian.  They complained of delays and confusion caused by colleagues being on two separate security systems, meaning important emails were often missed and people were being forced to work on out-of-date briefings. Despite it being more than 500 days since the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) merged with the Department for International Development (DfID), the integration of staff from both teams was said to be “a mess”. A Whitehall source told the Guardian: “Numerous crises have been worsened because of it.” After the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan last August, the Foreign Office came under intense criticism for the way it handled the crisis, including from a former desk officer. Raphael Marshall alleged there was a litany of problems and said civil servants from DfID had been “appalled” by the “chaotic system” they inherited, with staff unable to use live documents together or shared inboxes. Civil servants told the Guardian that those from DfID and the FCO are still working on different types of computers with separate security systems, meaning they are often not compatible with each another. The tech issues were said to affect emails, video calls and the way teams could work on crucial briefings together. Staff complained that emails exchanged between those who previously worked for DfID and the FCO were routinely flagged as spam or not delivered. When virtual meetings were held, insiders said that if the invite came from someone who had worked in the FCO then those from DfID were not able to participate properly. The DfID staff could not join calls without being approved, and crucially often were unable to access files stored on their FCO counterparts’ system, leading to delays and confusion. The tech problems were said to be seriously hampering officials’ ability to work quickly during crises, like the feared invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. “It’s so much effort to try and track people’s comments in briefing… It’s basically making an hour long job two hours, which is not the kind of time you have in these situations,” one FCDO insider said. Another told the Guardian that “colleagues routinely miss emails and feel that they’ve been overlooked”, which “causes chaos, especially in crisis points”. They were reluctant to divulge specific details about what operational impact on the Ukraine response the problems had had given security concerns, but spoke out due to their frustration that more than 530 days on from the departments’ merger, the issues were “still not fixed”. The officials also said FCO and DFID staff still use different human resources systems, meaning line managers who have staff from a department different from the one they came from struggle to sign off annual leave, complete reviews or approve overtime. Terms and conditions also have yet to be standardised, so there are still substantial pay disparities between people working at the same level who came from different departments. The recent ministerial reshuffle conducted by Boris Johnson had also caused problems in the Foreign Office, insiders claimed. They said the department felt short of a minister, with three ministers’ briefs beefed up and foreign secretary Liz Truss now responsible for the overall work of the Foreign Office, Brexit negotiations and the added responsibility of women and equalities. With much of Truss’s attention on Ukraine, one official lamented other urgent priorities were being “cast aside” and that there could be a Foreign Office “backlog, like the health one”. An FCDO spokesperson said: “The UK has helped lead the diplomatic and deterrence effort in response to the situation in Ukraine and this work remains a top priority for the department. All current staff are able to work on a shared FCDO Microsoft Teams platform.”",News/Politics,"Foreign Office IT issues hampering UK’s response to Ukraine crisis, say insiders",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/19/foreign-office-it-issues-hampering-uks-response-to-ukraine-crisis-say-insiders
2/19/2022,"The Duke of York’s legal battle with his accuser Virginia Giuffre, which he settled out of court this week, was characterised by a years-long series of damaging and unnecessary PR blunders, experts have said. His disastrous Newsnight interview, his ducking and diving to frustrate the serving of legal papers, and claims from “friends” that the infamous photograph of him with his arm around Giuffre’s waist was faked, all served to inflict further public opprobrium on the Queen’s second son, it was claimed.  The aggressive way Andrew fought the case, casting aspersions on Giuffre’s character, also attracted harsh censure from victims’ groups in the era of #MeToo, leading to a “volte face” when, in a joint statement issued this week, he said he had “never intended to malign” her. Twelve years after he was photographed with the sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein in New York’s Central Park, Andrew has been stripped of his patronages and titles. And though he has made no admission of liability and has repeatedly denied Guiffre’s allegations he had sex with her on three occasions when she was 17 and had been trafficked by Epstein, he has agreed to pay her an undisclosed sum, reportedly as high as £12m. “The Emily Maitlis Newsnight interview was like being in a comedy clown car with a lit cigarette driving into a fireworks factory,” said the PR agent Mark Borkowski. “I don’t believe anyone in the profession that I know would have advised him to do the Maitlis interview. “But he thought he could roll with it. He thought he had the charisma. And he thought that he had his own story. It’s an archetypal psychopathic reaction to the fact you are not accepting [the situation].” Andrew’s claims in the 2019 interview – that he was at a Pizza Express in Woking and that he had a condition that prevented him from sweating – were absolute gifts to social media, spawning hundreds of memes. His denial that he had thrown a birthday party for Epstein’s then girlfriend, and now also a convicted sex offender, Ghislaine Maxwell, insisting it was just a “straightforward shooting weekend”, showed how wide the chasm was between him and the public he was attempting to persuade. “He gave so many soundbites,” said Borkowski. Andrew should have looked to his mother for PR advice. The Queen’s statement that “recollections may vary” in response to claims made by Harry and Meghan in their Oprah interview was a masterclass “in what it said by saying so little”, said Borkowski. “And that is the art of dealing with a crisis.” Missing from Andrew’s Newsnight interview, and immediately seized on by commentators, was any acknowledgment of Epstein’s victims. It took the joint statement, made earlier this week, for him redress this by accepting that Giuffre had suffered “as an established victim of abuse”. Missing, too, was any expression of regret over his decades-long friendship with Epstein, who at the time the two were photographed had served 13 months for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. Again, it took this week’s statement for Andrew to promise to “demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking”. He did apologise in the interview, not for his relationship with Epstein but for its impact on the royal family. “We try to uphold the highest standards and practice,” he said, “and I let the side down, simple as that.” If he was guilty of anything, added the duke, it was of being “too honourable” in choosing to visit Epstein to break off their friendship in person. PR experts would hope in such crisis interviews their client would answer questions and address the facts put to them in a way that persuades viewers to interpret those facts in the way you want. A declaration that it’s “just not true” is not enough. “You have to be very certain about how the audience will look at your reactions to a negative comment. And I think another blunder he made was underestimating, not just the media, but … the actual public and … the power of social media,” said Borkowski. Given the out-of-court settlement agreed in principle, which has spared Andrew the ordeal of cross-examination on his private life before a jury, Maitlis said this week her interview “may be the only testimony” we will ever get directly from the duke. She is far from alone in now finding it difficult to marry his three words to her – “it didn’t happen” – with his decision to pay millions to a woman he has said he had no recollection of meeting. There are questions, too, over the aggressive tactics used by Andrew, especially in the #MeToo era. His apparent attempt to frustrate the serving of Giuffre’s legal papers did not play well. “It was unedifying, it looked ridiculous. But, more than a PR disaster, he was annoying the court,” Nick Goldstone, a lawyer at the disputes resolution firm Ince, said. Andrew’s defence document was “ludicrous in parts”, saying he was unable to answer questions such whether he had been habitually photographed at social events with Maxwell for lack of sufficient information, Goldstone added. Suggestions from “friends” of Andrew that the photograph of him with his arm around Giuffre’s waist was faked were “high risk”, especially as he did not have the original photograph. His claim of an inability to sweat, and the Pizza Express alibi, were ridiculed. Photographs were published allegedly showing him sweating on other occasions. His security team should have records of any Pizza Express visit – “so, produce those at the time you make the allegation”, Goldstone said. Andrew’s US legal team “could only play with the cards they were dealt” and on the instructions they received from their client, he said. And, by the time they took on the case, options for the prince were diminishing. The attacks on Giuffre’s character, accusing her of seeking a “payday” from Andrew, and attempts to introduce in to evidence a US tabloid story describing her as a “money-hungry sex kitten” who recruited young women for Epstein, have also been criticised. “He took an enormous decision to actually be aggressive. It’s different now, particularly when you are so behind the eight ball you’re snookered. And you come out fighting in the wrong way. His team did all the wrong things really really well,” said Borkowski. It backfired, and Andrew then had to say he did not intend to “malign” Giuffre. “A volte face,” said Goldstone. But perhaps the biggest blunder was not settling earlier, and only agreeing to after his attempts to have the case struck out failed, Goldstone said. Pinning hopes on Giuffre’s 2009 $500,000 secret settlement with Epstein was “going to be the trump card”. “But in my view, that didn’t have a hope of getting him out of this case.” Borkowski said: “The bottom line is, if you are representing somebody, or in particular if you are running a crisis campaign, you can give as much good advice as a PR person, but it’s whether the client, whether the person at the centre of the whirlwind, actually accepts it. And I think through all of this, this has been heavily laden with hubris. “I think I would have gone for the route of settlement, the route of arbitration. That was needed all the way down the line. There needed to be more jaw jaw, less war war.”",News/UK news,‘So many soundbites’: PR experts on Prince Andrew’s disastrous denials,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/19/pr-experts-prince-andrew-disastrous-denials
2/19/2022,"“I think everyone should consider skipping breakfast as an experiment,” says Professor Tim Spector, author of the recently reissued Spoon-Fed: Why Almost Everything We’ve Been Told About Food Is Wrong. The question of whether breakfast is or isn’t good for us has been around for years – with the waters thoroughly muddied by research funded by breakfast cereal brands like Kellogg’s and Quakers. (You can guess what they concluded.)  “We’ve been told, culturally – and via marketing – that we have to have it,” says Spector. But a 2020 US study from the National Institute of Aging suggests that intermittent fasting – which can mean skipping or postponing breakfast – may have health benefits. After spending time with a hunter-gatherer group in Tanzania, the Hadza, Spector is unconvinced about the need for breakfast: “I never saw anyone eating before about 10.30am, although they’d been up since dawn. They didn’t have a word for breakfast.” Spector’s advice? “Try skipping breakfast once or twice, just to see how you feel at lunchtime. Some people might lose energy, others might feel better. It is individual, but there are advantages: you’re getting a long overnight fast, which in the new science of restricted-time eating has been shown to be good for metabolism and probably for gut microbes as well.” Despite the popularity of porridge oats, and their ability to tackle blood cholesterol, in recent years there has been concern from wellness bloggers about the phytic acid in oats and its apparent ability to bind with other nutrients and prevent us absorbing them. The theory is that you don’t get all of the calcium from the milk in your porridge, say, or the phosphorus in the oats themselves. But don’t expect a backlash anytime soon, says Guardian food writer Felicity Cloake. Oats have been a northern hemisphere staple for millennia and as Cloake says: “I think we would have noticed by now if everyone was dying of nutritional deficiencies.” For Spector, this is another example of our reductionist tendencies when it comes to foods – which we never consume in isolation: “Phytates do reduce absorption of nutrients, but the question is, do they do that enough to make it an unhealthy food? Are there other things in that food that are beneficial? If you only ate oats, it might be a problem. If you have a diverse, balanced diet, aiming to eat 30 plants and vegetables a week – not a problem.” He does think there are other issues with oats, though; chiefly that for him, and others who metabolise like him, oats can cause blood glucose spikes, unless he eats the unprocessed kind which have to be cooked for hours. “The other thing is that they have very high pesticide levels, because they’re sprayed much more than other crops.” Spector’s research didn’t find anything harmful about having coffee or tea on an empty stomach. A 2020 study at the University of Bath suggested that ideally we’d drink coffee after breakfast, as it seems to have a negative effect on metabolic blood sugar control – meaning you get a spike from whatever you eat after drinking it, especially if you’ve had a bad night’s sleep. While a 2021 study by the University of Granada showed that about two coffees’ worth of caffeine may help us burn more fat when we exercise, an effect which is strongest in the morning. What about starting the day with warm water with lemon to cleanse our systems? “If you enjoy it, then have it, but water and lemon is not evidence-backed,” says registered dietitian Dr Sammie Gill. “It’s linked with words like ‘cleansing’ and ‘detoxifying’, but our liver and kidneys already do a very good job of removing anything the body doesn’t need or want.” Homemade smoothies can be a good way to up your plant intake, but they have downsides. Studies show that blending can speed up how the body absorbs naturally occurring sugars, causing the same metabolically unhelpful rises and falls as sugary drinks; they’re not great for tooth enamel; and when drunk at speed, won’t help us feel sated. “Traditional breakfast cereals are ultra processed, however healthy they look on the packet,” says Spector, who is not a fan. “There’s so little to commend them: a combination of sugar and disassociated grains that have been melted, then pressurised and reshaped, with all the goodness taken out, and low-quality vitamins put back. It’s also true for things we regard as healthier, like muesli and granola.” Bacon, meanwhile, contains three times the amount of protein, but much more salt. The evidence is pretty incontrovertible that meats processed with nitrites – chemicals used to keep bacon, ham and salami pink, as well as to speed up the curing process – are carcinogenic, but they are still widely used. In theory, nitro-chemicals prevent botulism, but many pork producers now opt out of using them, including every single maker of Parma ham for the last 25 years, without an increase in botulism. For meat eaters, bacon will always win over bran flakes, so if you’re craving a butty, do your damnedest to find nitrite-free bacon. For a lot of parents, cereal is the only thing their kids will eat in the morning. But, says Gill, “the type of breakfast cereal you choose matters – for growing children, it’s important that healthy habits are developed from a young age, and once they are introduced to high sugar cereals, it’s often difficult to get them to accept lower sugar options. Choosing a cereal for children can be really challenging – what you think looks like a healthy option may not be.” Oats, wheat biscuits, shredded wholewheat cereals or muesli (go for no added sugar or salt varieties) are good options, and adding chopped fruit, nuts, seeds and plain yoghurt will help create a more balanced breakfast. The best person to answer this is Cloake, whose next book is called Red Sauce, Brown Sauce: A British Breakfast Odyssey (out in June). “Almost everyone I spoke to in the UK had an opinion,” she says. “It felt as though brown sauce was more northern and ketchup was a bit of a newcomer, more southern and possibly more middle class. If I had to join a camp then I’d say brown sauce, with its spices, is the connoisseur’s choice. Ketchup just makes everything taste of ketchup. “But – and I feel like a bad British person for saying this – I much prefer English mustard in a bacon sandwich. And marmalade.” Sorry, what? “Think about it – ham is often glazed with mustard and honey. A friend introduced me to it, and it feels like Damascene moment every time I eat one.” This was the idea of the 1950s Egg Marketing Board, and as such can’t be considered unbiased nutritional advice. They aren’t a bad idea, though. “Eggs are a source of protein, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12 and iodine,” says Gill. Milk is a minefield – there’s no clear answer. Cow’s milk produces at least three times as much greenhouse gas as any non-dairy milk; almond requires lots of water and is bad for bees; rice is water-intense and low in nutrients; coconut may contribute to deforestation, mono-culturisation and worker exploitation; and although soy seems better for health than previously thought, it is only sustainable if it’s not grown on land cleared from rainforests. Better options are oat, which is a cool-climate product and shouldn’t require massive land-use changes if demand increases (huge quantities of oats are already used in animal feed) – though it’s relatively low in protein. Hemp and pea, which grow in the northern hemisphere and are naturally rich in certain nutrients, or potato milk – the very new kid on the block – are good. A new potato milk, called Dug, is being launched in Waitrose this month, and claims to need 56 times less water than almond, as well as using half the land required to grow oats. The barista version works well in coffee, is creamy, doesn’t split and isn’t – unlike many plant milks – overpoweringly sweet. On its own (though maybe this is just me) it does have a very slight potato note, but you wouldn’t notice in something like porridge. Almost all big-brand plant-based milks contain acidity regulators, emulsifiers or stabilisers, consumption of which some scientists are beginning to link with poorer gut health. Whether you actually like any of the above in your morning brew, though, is an entirely different matter … Unlike our sweet, beige breakfasts, in many other countries the first meal of the day is as flavourful or spicy as any other, like Indian dal, roti and pickles. (There’s even some early evidence that adding more capsaicin via chillies to our diets might be good for gut health and help fight obesity, so perhaps we really should spice things up.) “We’ve got into a rut in this country, and it’s a very high-carbohydrate rut,” says Spector, whose favourite breakfasts are those served in Korean and Japanese hotels, featuring things like miso soup, beans, kimchi, rice or noodles, meat or fish and vegetable sides. “Many people – though not everybody – would be better off with meats, cheeses and egg, or fermented foods. Breakfast used to be just the leftovers from the evening meal the night before.” He would like to see us embrace variety to find our own nutritional sweet spots. “We should be a bit more experimental and see what suits us.” You can, but it’s worth considering what sort of bread you toast, and what you put on it. “Some breads are better than others – sourdoughs and rye breads will give you much less sugar and are high in fibre,” says Spector. The world won’t end if you have jam on it, but it is “a massive sugar hit, so maybe have it with cheese instead,” he advises.",Lifestyle/Food,‘Should I use potato milk in my porridge?’: what you should really eat for breakfast,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/19/beafast-have-we-been-getting-it-all-wrong
2/19/2022,"Privacy laws that make it harder for the media to name individuals under criminal investigation could be rolled back as part of ministers’ plans to replace the Human Rights Act, government sources have suggested. The claim follows concerns raised by media outlets over this week’s landmark Bloomberg v ZXC supreme court ruling. Judges concluded that Bloomberg News was wrong to name a businessman facing a criminal investigation relating to his work activities because he had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The verdict makes it more difficult for the media to report that individuals are under criminal investigation if they have not been charged with any offence. John Micklethwait, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, said the ruling meant Britain was “stumbling toward a system in which tabloids can still peek into celebrities’ bedrooms but serious journalists cannot report on potential wrongdoing at public companies by powerful people”. He said the ruling would benefit those able to afford enormous legal bills, rather than ordinary members of the public, adding: “The courts have now presented the powerful with a path to keep their names out of print for years … This right to privacy is only for those who can afford it; strangely enough, these often tend to be those who have the most to hide.” Ministers are reluctant to directly criticise judges but a government spokesperson said they were looking at the ruling. “A free press is one of the cornerstones of any democracy. The government recognises the vital role the media plays in holding people to account and shining a light on the issues which matter most. We will study the implications of the judgment carefully,” they said. Ministry of Justice sources pointed towards an ongoing consultation on replacing the existing Human Rights Act. The existing law, which was introduced by Tony Blair’s Labour government in 2000, is based on the European convention on human rights. Ministers want to replace it with a new British Bill of Rights as part of their post-Brexit policies – a move that has been criticised by many in the legal profession. A consultation document published at the end of last year states that ministers want to prioritise freedom of expression and “that courts should only grant relief impinging on it where there are exceptional reasons”. The document also stated it should not be left to judges to develop privacy law through case-by-case rulings and “there should be a presumption in favour of upholding the right to freedom of expression, subject to exceptional countervailing grounds, clearly spelt out by parliament”. As part of the Bloomberg case, the judges concluded that the businessman had a reasonable expectation that the details of the British regulator’s criminal investigation into him would not be made public unless he was charged. The Bloomberg verdict follows a similar ruling in a 2018 case involving the BBC and Cliff Richard, where the singer won substantial damages from the national broadcaster for invasion of privacy. The BBC had reported Richard was the subject of a police investigation into historical allegations that ultimately proved to be baseless and did not result in any criminal charge. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, also won a privacy victory against the Mail on Sunday after it published a private letter she had sent her father. Micklethwaitesaid his outlet had paid the price for such “tabloidish excesses” and warned serious investigations were being undermined by judges increasingly prioritising the right to privacy.",News/World news,"Privacy laws could be rolled back, government sources suggest",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/privacy-laws-could-be-rolled-back-government-sources-suggest
2/19/2022,"Pay growth is picking up, official figures showed this week, but for key workers on the pandemic frontline the champagne is firmly on ice. The detail behind annual pay growth of 4.9% in December revealed the gulf between the size of awards being handed to public sector workers, and those in the private sector, boosted in part by swelling banker bonuses.  At the headline level, private sector wage growth including bonuses picked up to 5.4% in December, more than double the 2.5% growth rate in the public sector, according to the Office for National Statistics. With inflation running at 5.4% in the same month – and expected to rise to more than 7% by April – the squeeze on incomes is already a reality for many of those keeping public services running in the most challenging conditions. Workers in the finance and insurance sector enjoyed annual wage growth, including bonuses, of 21.6% in December – quadruple the rate of inflation. Fuelled by a bumper bonus season in the City, the figure represents the biggest jump since January 2011. Excluding one-off awards, finance and insurance pay still rose at an inflation-beating 7%. Meanwhile, wage growth in real estate soared by more than 14%. In contrast, pay growth for health and social workers was below the rate of inflation at 4.5%. Progress on pay was worse still in public administration, at 2.1%, and was just 0.3% in the education sector. Pay in the arts, entertainment and recreation fell by 6.9% before inflation is even taken into account. “The good times may be back for the City. But it’s a different story for everyone else,” said Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC. “While banking executives coin it in, millions of families are suffering the worst squeeze on real wages in more than 200 years. At a time when ordinary people are being told to tighten their belts and not ask for a decent pay rise, there is no justification for these kind of bumper payouts.” NatWest was the first big UK bank to report its annual bonus pool on Friday, increasing it by 44% for 2021 to nearly £300m after returning to profit. Chief executive Alison Rose said the bank had shown “significant restraint” but had to pay fairly in a competitive market. London’s big four banks – HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and NatWest – are expected to pay bonuses totalling more than £4bn for 2021, and make profits of more than £34bn – the most since 2007 in the boom before the financial crisis. Official figures show that average weekly pay was still £1 below the 2008 peak in December 2020. Disposable incomes are expected to fall at the fastest rate this year since at least the early 1990s, while a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the average UK worker will be about £13,000 a year worse off by the middle of the 2020s than if wages had grown at pre-2008 financial crisis rates. The figures come after the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, called for workers to show restraint in the annual wage-setting process to prevent higher rates of inflation from becoming embedded. His comments drew a furious response from unions, as well as a rebuke from No 10 and the chairman of Tesco. Some economists question whether workers have the bargaining power to demand higher pay despite low levels of unemployment after lockdown, highlighting a sharp fall in trade union power in recent decades. Others say pay conditions are stronger than at any time for at least a decade. With tighter restrictions on workplace organisation and changes to the structure of the British economy, trade union membership has fallen sharply from a peak of about 13.2 million in 1979 to about 6.6 million, representing about a quarter of the workforce. “The idea of [inflation] getting embedded is for the birds,” said Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, who is critical of its current position. “The reason in the 1970s that it got embedded after oil prices rose was a huge rise in unionisation rates. The 70s were unique in that unionisation rates rose by 10 points around the world. What makes you think suddenly that’s the case now?” Some sectors with the worst staff shortages are recording higher rates of pay growth, according to economists at the jobs website Indeed, including for lorry drivers, chefs and construction workers. However, this pressure is not widespread. In one example of weaker than average pay growth, the supermarket chain Asda last week announced a sub-inflation deal to raise pay by 3.25% to £9.66 an hour, or £10.83 for employees in London. Asda said it would go further to £10.06 in April 2023 – a deal it argued “in the current environment provides reassurance for colleagues”. However, the supermarket could be forced into a rethink. Forecasts from the Low Pay Commission, which advises the government on the national living wage, suggest the legal pay floor could rise to £10.18 from 2023. The current rate of £8.91 is set to rise to £9.50 from April this year – a jump of 6.6% which had been expected to be inflation-busting until recently. Nadine Houghton, a national officer at the trade union GMB, said a lack of proper union recognition meant the firm could force staff to accept a pay deal below the industry average. Asda has an agreement with the Usdaw shop workers union for staff in Northern Ireland but does not allow for negotiations on pay with GMB in Great Britain. “Where workers have [unionisation] there is an opportunity to improve wages and everything else. Where they don’t – which is the case for pay and conditions at Asda – the cost of living is going to dramatically outstrip wages,” she said. Asda said it was the only supermarket to offer a bonus worth several hundred pounds a year on average, as part of a comprehensive benefits package. The lacklustre pay figures for the public sector come as unions push for an inflation-busting wage deal for the NHS to halt a rise in staff departing the health service after more than a decade of real-terms cuts for many employees. Christina McAnea, the general secretary of the Unison trade union, said a key lesson from the Covid-19 pandemic was that well-resourced, properly staffed services were essential. “It’s depressing, but not surprising, that City wages are way ahead of public sector pay in the race against rising prices,” she said. “Companies struggling to recruit are paying a wage premium to keep and attract staff. The government must find the cash so health, care, council, police and school employers can do the same.”",News/Business,Gulf between public and private sectors lies behind UK pay growth reports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/19/gulf-between-public-and-private-sectors-lies-behind-uk-pay-growth-reports
2/19/2022,"AGuardian investigation into nickel mining and the electric vehicle industry has found evidence that a source of drinking water close to one of Indonesia’s largest nickel mines is contaminated with unsafe levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr6), the cancer-causing chemical more widely known for its role in the Erin Brockovich story and film. The investigation also found evidence suggesting elevated levels of lung infections among people living close to the mine.  Recent years have seen a race between mining companies to gain control of the world’s largest nickel reserves in Indonesia. Nickel, an essential component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, could bring transformational wealth to a country where Covid has pushed the number of people in poverty up to 10.19%. Yet people living on the remote Obi Island, which has recently become home to one of Indonesia’s largest nickel mines, just want clean and safe water. Unlike other minerals used to power EVs such as cobalt and lithium – which have been linked to environmental damage and human rights abuses –nickel’s supply chain has so far gone largely unscrutinised. The mining companies operational on Obi Island say their works pose no threat to local communities. Yet in the village of Kawasi, people are scared. One villager, Richard*, says that since the mine arrived the water has become dangerous to drink. “In the past, before there was a company, even though we lived without electricity, we were safe. Now we are afraid,” says Richard*. Water samples taken by the Guardian near Kawasi and tested at government-certified laboratories suggest high levels of contamination from hexavalent chromium (Cr6), a cancer-causing chemical. The villagers also claim that since the mine arrived, people have been falling sick. The Guardian was told by the village midwife clinic of more than 900 cases of potentially deadly acute respiratory infections (ARI) among the approximately 4,000 residents of Kawasi in 2020. More than half of the cases were reported to be in newborns or toddlers aged four and under. According to Indonesian health officials, the ARI prevalence in Kawasi was just under 20% in 2020, compared with a national average of 9%. Aside from the midwife clinic there was no active local health centre in the village when the Guardian visited. “The difference [since the mining started] is enormous. The beach was still clean, the sea was not muddy like this and not red yet. People still fished in front of their houses,” says a nurse who has lived in the village since 2009, before the mine started operating. “The trend of [higher] ARI cases began at the same time as [mining] exploration also began,” adds the nurse. “I keep thinking: is there any future for the children?” says Maria*, who grew up in the village. Given its extreme remoteness, it is unsurprising few activists or journalists have visited Obi Island to talk to residents until now. From the capital, Jakarta, it takes a three-and-half hour flight, an overnight boat and another two hours at sea to reach Kawasi’s port. The plywood buildings and sporadic streets lights in Kawasi couldn’t feel more distant from glitzy city showrooms acclaiming fossil fuel-free travel. As you disembark you can hear the constant creak and crash of cranes as they distribute their loads around the busy mining operations. The $1bn site, owned by the Indonesia-based Harita Group and China’s Lygend Mining, digs and processes nickel for use in EV batteries. The Chinese battery component producer GEM has signed an agreement to purchase nickel from the company, PT Halmahera Persada Lygend. GEM supplies battery components to many of the world’s leading EV battery manufacturers, including Chinese-owned CATL, which controls about 30% of the global battery market. The ultimate beneficiaries are likely to be many of the most well-known EV brands, with nickel from these mines used to produce batteries that could end up in cars sold by Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen (VW). Booming nickel prices and a “battery arms race” have seen a rush to develop mines but there are fears that regulatory oversight has failed to keep up with the pace of development. “They [the Indonesian government] are trying to remove red tape to make the industry more attractive for investment, but without proper environmental assessments, it could be risky given the way the industry is heading,” says Indonesian nickel mining expert Steven Brown. Holding mining companies and the supply chain to account for pollution is difficult, says Matthew Baird, an environmental lawyer based in south-east Asia, especially when there could be multiple sources for the contamination. “These big mining operations are very much in areas that are very inaccessible and where they are operating as a de facto local government ‘company town’,” he says. “Mining companies may blame other problems and that all may be correct, but because they are there, there is a likelihood they are contributing to the problem.” Near the village of Kawasi, water samples collected by the Guardian from a fountain less than 200 metres from the mining site and tested at government-certified laboratories suggest high levels of contamination from carcinogenic Cr6: 60 parts per billion (ppb). The maximum contaminant level allowed by law in Indonesia is 50 ppb. Cr6 can cause liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harm when ingested or inhaled. Long-term exposure through drinking water has also been linked to stomach cancer. Evidence has shown that Cr6 in drinking water can be a result of industrial processes. The fountain the Guardian’s samples were taken from comes out of rocks above Kawasi; villagers claim it is their only source of water for drinking, bathing and washing fruit and vegetables. “The impacts of this [type of] mining are persistent, long term and in some ways subtle. It’s not like a large catastrophic failure. These are Erin Brockovich long-term, persistent and subtle impacts that the regulatory system is not necessarily equipped to deal with,” says Baird. In response to questions from the Guardian, Halmahera Persada Lygend said ARI was common in developing countries, especially in tropical regions. It said the solution included adequate nutrition for children from the time they are in the womb, proper hygiene within homes and improved awareness through education. In response to the allegations of unsafe levels of Cr6, the company said tests it had conducted on Kawasi’s spring water from 2013 to 2021 showed that it met the water quality standards set by the government, with results of Cr6 content in the range of 5 to 40 ppb. It said its tests had showed there was no Cr6 discharge from its system or impact on the water quality of the Kawasi springs. Brown says mines in Indonesia are only required to check for chromium (Cr6 and Cr6+) once a month and are probably not yet fully aware of the risks. Halmahera Persada Lygend said that the positive and negative impacts of its projects had been assessed in an environmental impact analysis, which has been reviewed and approved by the government. It also said provincial and district environmental offices regularly conducted site inspections to review company operations and take samples for analysis if needed. Mercedes-Benz said it took the allegations seriously and was immediately contacting its direct supplier to clarify the issues raised, even though it does not buy nickel directly.
