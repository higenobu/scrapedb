3/23/2022,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The attorney for a former Tennessee nurse on trial in the death of a patient accidentally injected with a paralyzing drug told jurors Tuesday the woman is being blamed for systemic problems at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. RaDonda Vaught, 37, is facing a charge of reckless homicide for administering the drug vecuronium to 75-year-old Charlene Murphey instead of the sedative Versed on Dec. 26, 2017. Murphey had been admitted to the hospital two days earlier after developing a headache and losing vision in one eye. On the 26th, doctors ordered a PET scan to check for cancer, but Murphey was claustrophobic and asked for medication to control her anxiety, according to testimony. Vaught could not find Versed in an automatic drug dispensing cabinet because it was listed under the generic name midazolam. Instead she used an override mechanism to type in “VE” then grabbed vecuromium, according to court records. Vaught left the imaging area after injecting the drug, but minutes later another employee noticed Murphey was unresponsive. The family removed the woman from life support in the early hours of Dec. 27. Nashville Assistant District Attorney General Debbie Housel said during opening statements Tuesday that the nurse ignored warning labels on the medication and didn't notice the medication she chose was very different from the one needed. “RaDonda Vaught recklessly ignored everything she learned in school” when she administered vecuronium, a drug sometimes used in executing prisoners, the prosecutor said. “Vecuronium is only given when someone is intubated because it paralyzes the body,” Housel said. “A person can’t breathe, can’t move, can’t shout for help.” In addition to the override, Vaught also failed to scan the medication against the patient’s medical identification bracelet, Housel said. She added that the drug she chose was a powder that had to be reconstituted, instead of a liquid. Defense attorney Peter Strianse told the jury the hospital was at least partially to blame for Murphey's death. He said that in 2017, problems with a new electronic records system led to delays in communication between the pharmacy and the hospital’s automatic drug dispensing cabinets. This often forced nurses to override the system, he said. There also was no scanner for the medication in the imaging area of the hospital where the accident happened. Vaught admitted her error as soon as she realized it, and the state medical board initially took no action against her. The finger-pointing only began after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services learned of the error and made a surprise inspection at Vanderbilt, according to Strianse. “This was a high stakes game of musical chairs and blame seeking,” Strianse said. “When the music stopped, there was no chair for RaDonda Vaught.” Testifying on Tuesday was Murphey's daughter-in-law Chandra Murphey, who cried as she recalled Charlene Murphy's last days. The two had been preparing Christmas dinner on Dec. 24, 2017, when the older woman started complaining about her vision. Chandra Murphey convinced her to go to the emergency room, where they found a brain bleed. Murphey was transfered to Vanderbilt's intensive care unit but was getting better before the accident, Chandra Murphey testified. She was at the hospital with her mother-in-law when she was taken downstairs for the PET scan and saw her again when she was brought back upstairs, surrounded by the doctors who were trying to save her life. “How in the world do you take someone down for a PET scan and bring her back like this?” she asked. “They basically took her down fine and brought her back dead.”",U.S./Associated Press,Accidental injection death of wrong drug: Ex-nurse on trial,https://news.yahoo.com/accidental-injection-death-wrong-drug-202157721.html
3/23/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's armed forces said on Monday they had docked a large, beachable landing support ship, the Orsk, in the occupied Ukrainian port of Berdyansk, 70 km (45 miles) southwest of the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. As part of what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" launched almost a month ago, Russian forces have seized most of the Ukrainian coast along the Sea of Azov, an appendage of the Black Sea, except for Mariupol, which has refused to surrender. ""It is hard to overestimate the possibilities of using this port,"" said the website of the Russian armed forces news outlet Zvezda (Star). ""Now the southern flank of the special operation can receive everything necessary at any time, including equipment and ammunition."" The Zvezda website said 10 such ships were participating in the operation. It said each could carry up to 20 tanks or 40 armoured personnel carriers.

3/23/2022,"By Angelo Amante and Crispian Balmer ROME (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to address the Italian parliament on Tuesday, but a small number of lawmakers say they will shun the speech, arguing that his appearance will not help restore peace. Their snub highlights a strong pacifist strain in Italy, shaped partly by the country's disastrous involvement in World War Two. But it also reflects a pro-Russia vein that runs deep through some of the country's main political parties. Unusually for a Western nation, Italy had strong links with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and these ties improved during President Vladimir Putin's long rule, making the country one of Russia's closest allies within the European Union. Prime Minister Mario Draghi has redressed the balance since taking office in 2021, promoting a vigorous, pro-NATO line, and all the major parties have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, even those that had an especially close relationship with Moscow -- Forza Italia, the 5-Star Movement and the League. However, at least 20 lawmakers have said they will snub Zelenskiy's appearance and criticised the decision to allow him to address both chambers -- an honour previously awarded to just Spain's King Juan Carlos and Pope John Paul II. Zelenskiy has already spoken via video to parliaments in Britain, the United States, Israel and Germany, and is expected on Tuesday to repeat his calls for more help to combat Russia. Senator Gianluigi Paragone told Reuters he would not be listening. ""We have already heard Zelenskiy's preaching and if we did what he wanted, it would lead us straight to war in Europe,"" said Paragone, who used to be in the 5-Star and has since formed an anti-EU group called Italexit. ARMS AN ISSUE Around 17 lawmakers in the Alternative group, almost all 5-Star dissidents, have also said they would boycott the speech. ""It is merely a marketing operation that will not help end hostilities,"" the lawmakers said in a statement, calling on Rome to do more to promote peace talks and criticising the Italian parliament for having voted to send arms to Ukraine. The vote in the lower chamber last week drew cross-party support, but dozens of parliamentarians failed to show up, including many members of the rightist League, whose head Matteo Salvini has previously praised Putin as a great world leader. At least one League politician, Vito Comencini, confirmed to Reuters that he would skip Zelenskiy's speech. He declined to explain his decision, but he has made clear his pro-Russia stance on social media, visiting St. Petersburg last week and handing over aid for people from the Donbass area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv's rule in 2014. ""They are people who have been living in a war zone since 2014, guilty (only) of demanding that their demands be recognised,"" Comencini wrote on Facebook. Salvini himself has dialled down his previous fervent support for Moscow and has said he will listen to Zelenskiy. However, he has also said he will struggle to back the dispatch of weapons to Ukraine when the motion goes to the Senate in the coming days. ""I say with full honesty, I am in difficulty because a democratic culture does not stop bombs with other bombs, but with democracy (and) dialogue,"" Salvini told RAI TV last week.
