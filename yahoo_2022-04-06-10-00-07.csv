4/6/2022,"Exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky said Putin's conscription in Ukraine may backfire. He said ""big cities are going to end up in coffins"" if Putin conscripts soldiers from urban areas. The Russian government has admitted to sending young conscripts to fight in Ukraine. Exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky said Russian President Vladimir Putin could face massive political backlash if he were to continue to send high numbers of conscripted soldiers from big cities in Russia to fight in Ukraine. During an interview with the Atlantic Council, Khodorkovsky weighed in whether he thought if Putin would send new waves of conscripts to Ukraine after NATO estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the war so far. He said the scenario was possible and that ""the value of human life in Russia, is not as high as one would like to see it be."" ""Especially when we are talking about people who live in the north Caucasus, or people who live in tiny villages and settlements,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""Knowing this, Putin is taking his soldiers specifically from those places. And he pays such money for their deaths, forcing their close relatives to keep their mouths shut."" On March 9, after weeks of denying, the Russian government admitted that it had sent young conscripts to Ukraine. Khodorkovsky was asked about the possibility of Putin sending 100,000 to 200,000 more conscripted soldiers to Ukraine, which he said would be a ""extremely heavy"" political decision for the Russian president. ""Without a doubt, such a step, if Putin is forced to take it, is going to be politically extremely heavy for him. And even more, he could call up a million people, but then big cities are going to end up in coffins,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""Big cities where public opinion is entirely different as to the value of human life, and for Putin that would be a massive problem on the eve of a transfer of power in 2024."" Khodorkovsky was formerly an oil tycoon living in Russia and was jailed by Putin's government in 2003 after being charged with financial crimes. During the nine years he was imprisoned, he maintained that he was jailed for political reasons. Since his release in 2013, Khodorkovsky has been an active member of Russia's exiled opposition. In the interview, he reiterated his belief that Putin believes he is ""at war with the US and NATO."" In March, the UN said at least 1,119 civilians had been killed in Russia's war on Ukraine. NATO has estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have died during the course of the war, while Russia has claimed that 1,351 of its soldiers have been killed. In his last update on troop deaths on March 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had died in the war.

4/6/2022,"Several Russian influencers and socialites say they've been barred from purchasing Chanel goods. One influencer accused the fashion house of ""Russophobia"" for restrictions at a Dubai outlet. Another socialite said some Russian shoppers had pulled strings to acquire luxury goods. Several Russian influencers and socialites say they've been barred from purchasing Chanel items and were told it was the brand's policy not to sell to customers who intended to bring the products back to Russia. Anna Kalashnikova, a Russian socialite and influencer, posted on her Instagram account on Sunday accusing Chanel of ""Russophobia in action."" She said she hadn't been able to buy a pair of earrings and a bag at a Chanel outlet in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ""Since I often come to Dubai for Fashion Week, Chanel managers recognized me, approached me, and said: 'We know that you are a celebrity in Russia, we know that you will take your purchases there, so we cannot sell you our brand items,'"" Kalashnikova said in her post. She said the experience reminded her of how ""Coco Chanel was not only mistress of a Nazi"" but was a fascist agent. ""The actions of her legacy, her brand make you think about the biography of Coco Chanel. Supporting fascism and Russophobia is so low,"" Kalashnikova said. Drawing attention to Coco Chanel's links to Nazi Germany appears to echo the Russian government's dubious framing of its war against Ukraine as a military operation meant to root out Nazis in the Ukrainian government — a government led by a Jewish president. The unprovoked nature of Russia's late-February invasion led to historically strict sanctions by governments including the European Union. Representatives for Chanel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, but the Daily Mail appeared to confirm the French brand's policy, saying the company issued a statement noting that EU and Swiss sanctions prohibited ""the sale, directly or indirectly, of luxury items to any natural, legal person or entity in the Russian Federation or for use in the Russian Federation."" The Russian interior designer and influencer Liza Litvin posted an Instagram story — seen by Fortune and the Daily Mail — detailing a similar experience of not being allowed to purchase Chanel items in Dubai. In the post, Litvin said she had to sign a document at a Chanel outlet declaring that she didn't live in Russia and wouldn't wear the bag on Russian soil. ""I went to a Chanel boutique in the Mall of the Emirates. They didn't sell me the bag because (attention!) I am from Russia!"" Litvin wrote in the post, per Fortune. At the same time, a Ukrainian socialite, Snezhanna Georgieva, said some Russian shoppers had managed to find back doors to negotiate the purchasing of Chanel items, per the New York Post. ""I will love it when these brands are back,"" Georgieva said. ""But we know some boutiques that are still open when a regular customer calls them."" On Friday, the pro-Kremlin tabloid Pravda ran a rebuttal to Chanel's stance from Maria Zakharova, a representative from the Russian Foreign Ministry, who accused the brand of supporting Nazism by not selling products to Russian customers. ""We just opened a closet, from which 80-year-old skeletons that had not yet decayed had fallen out,"" Zakharova's statement said. ""We are a very patient and forgiving country. We have forgiven everyone for everything, we have turned the page and made way for the future. However, if this way is a ring road, we will break this vicious circle."" Vogue Business reported on March 4 that luxury stores in Russia were seeing a threefold increase in shoppers, with people ""trying to buy as much as possible while they can still afford it."" Several days later, luxury brands like Burberry, Chanel, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Kering announced the temporary closings of their stores in Russia.

4/6/2022,"By Rachel Savage and Marc Jones LONDON (Reuters) -The fallout of the Russia and Ukraine war has just helped tip two of world's poorest countries into full-blown crises, and the list of those at risk - and the queue at the International Monetary Fund's door - will only get longer from here. They may be far from the fighting in Ukraine, but a mass resignation of Sri Lanka's cabinet on Monday and drastic weekend manoeuvres by Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan to avoid his removal, show how far the economic impact spreads. Both Sri Lanka and Pakistan have seen their long-festering public disquiet about economic mismanagement come to a head, but there is a double-digit list of other countries also in the danger zone. A handful were already on the brink of debt crises in the wake of the COVID pandemic, the war's resulting surge in energy and food prices, however, have undoubtedly made things worse. Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya and others that also import the majority of their oil and gas as well as basic foodstuffs, such as wheat and corn, which have all soared between 25% and 40% this year, have also been facing heavy pressure. Mounting costs of imports and subsidies for those everyday essentials had already convinced Cairo to devalue its currency 15% and seek IMF help in recent weeks. Tunisia and a long-resistant Sri Lanka have asked for assistance too. Ghana, still reluctant to approach the Fund, meanwhile is seeing its currency slide, while Pakistan, a country already with 22 IMF programmes to its name, is almost certain to need more having now sunk into turmoil again. ""This energy shock is certainly contributing to the political uncertainty in Sri Lanka and Pakistan,"" said Renaissance Capital's chief economist Charlie Robertson, flagging it as a key factor for both Egypt and Ghana too. ""It wouldn't surprise me if more countries were impacted,"" he added, citing Jordan as well and Morocco where a relatively sizable middle class makes it sensitive to political change. HUNGER IN AFRICA IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has given a stark warning that ""war in Ukraine means hunger in Africa"". The IMF's sister organisation, the World Bank, has also said https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/are-we-ready-coming-spate-debt-crises a dozen of the world's poorest countries may now default over the next year, which would be ""the largest spate of debt crises in developing economies in a generation"". Overindebted ""frontier' economies"", as the least developed group of countries are referred to, now owe $3.5 trillion — some $500 billion above pre-pandemic levels, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates. Pakistan and Sri Lanka already spent the equivalent of 3.4% and 2.2% of their respective GDP's on energy before the pandemic. In Turkey the figure was an even larger 6.5%, and with oil prices having been above $100 a barrel for months now, the pressures are getting worse. Every additional $10 spent on a barrel of oil adds 0.3% to Turkey's current account deficit, according to the IIF. For Lebanon it is 1.3%, while rating agency Fitch estimates that the cost of electricity subsidies in Tunisia could surge to over 1.8% of its GDP this year from 0.8%. UNREST Food prices are a biting problem too. They were already rising as countries emerged from lockdowns, exacerbated in some regions by droughts. With Ukraine and Russia accounting for 29% of the world's wheat exports and 19% of maize shipments, prices of these have gone up another 25%-30% this year. Egypt buys over 60% of its wheat overseas, four-fifths from Russia and Ukraine. After devaluing its currency and approaching the IMF, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government has also just fixed bread prices to contain runaway food costs. ""For many countries these (energy and food price) rises will have repercussions for budgets, for subsidies and for political and social stability."" said Viktor Szabo, an emerging market portfolio manager at abrdn in London. ""If you don't control prices you can have unrest, just think back to the Arab Spring and the role of food prices there."" With global borrowing costs also now rising rapidly as major central banks start to raise interest rates, Max Castle, a fixed income portfolio manager at Mediolanum Irish Operations said several emerging markets commodity importers may have little choice but seek help. ""It is the right situation for the IMF to intervene supporting the more vulnerable countries – particularly the ones with a current account deficit,"" he said.
