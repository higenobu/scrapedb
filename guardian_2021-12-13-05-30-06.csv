12/13/2021,"The Barcelona coach, Xavi Hernández, has warned his team are stuck in a “negative spiral” after they let three points slip from their grasp in a 2-2 draw at Osasuna. Deprived of seven key players through injury, Xavi was forced to turn to his youngsters and it looked to have paid off as the visitors took an early lead. Seventeen-year-old Gavi found Nico González with a precise through-ball that left the 19-year-old to fire past the keeper.  Osasuna hit straight back with a header from defender David García, but Barça retook the lead on the counter when another teenager, Abdessamad Ezzalzouli, volleyed home from Ousmane Dembélé’s cross. Barcelona had broken away while Osasuna’s players were protesting that Sergio Busquets had handled the ball. Barça held on until the 86th minute, when Chimy Ávila’s low shot from outside the box deflected in off Samuel Umtiti’s right foot. It was a bitter blow, but Xavi’s side had struggled to control the game or create chances in Pamplona. “We are in a negative spiral and we need to find a way to break it,” Xavi said after the game. “This draw is not enough. When we scored the second goal we should have taken control but we didn’t and that made us suffer.”Elsewhere in La Liga, Real Betis climbed to third with a 4-0 home win over Real Sociedad, with wing-back Álex Moreno scoring twice for Manuel Pellegrini’s side. Villarreal followed up their midweek Champions League triumph with a 2-0 home win over Rayo Vallecano, Gerard Moreno’s penalty securing victory. In Serie A, Napoli slipped to a surprise 1-0 defeat at home to Empoli, their third loss from their last five league games. Eljif Elmas’ shot caught the top of the crossbar in the first half, but the visitors went in front through Patrick Cutrone’s header in the 70th minute. Luciano Spalletti’s side threw everything at Empoli late on – the hosts finished the match having had 30 shots at goal – but without injured striker Victor Osimhen, and a host of other key players, they could not muster an equaliser and fall to fourth in the table. Atalanta moved above them into third after winning 2-1 at Verona to bolster their title credentials. Giovanni Simeone’s 12th league goal of the season put the hosts in front, but Aleksey Miranchuk’s close-range finish and Teun Koopmeiners’ deflected strike turned the game around. Elsewhere, Sassuolo struck twice in quick succession in the second half to beat Lazio 2-1 at home. Goals from Domenico Berardi and Giacomo Raspadori sealed the hosts’ comeback after Mattia Zaccagni had put Lazio ahead. Antonio Sanabria opened the scoring for Torino as they beat Bologna 2-1 at home. Marseille are up to second in Ligue 1 after earning a 2-0 win at Strasbourg. Bamba Dieng’s spectacular bicycle kick broke the deadlock just after the hour mark before Duje Caleta-Car headed the second for Jorge Sampaoli’s side. Rennes are third after a 2-1 home defeat to Nice, who are one point behind in fourth after goals from Kasper Dolberg and Youcef Atal earned victory. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen took a two-goal lead at Eintracht Frankfurt through Patrik Schick’s double, but were rocked by the hosts’ incredible comeback to win 5-2. Lucas Tuta and Jesper Lindstrom quickly got Eintracht on terms, before Evan N’Dicka stabbed home from close range. Fine finishes from Kristjan Jakic and Djibril Sow completed the rout. Bottom club Greuther Fürth earned their first league win of the season as they edged out Union Berlin 1-0. Havard Nielsen’s winner ended a run of 12 straight league defeats, but the promoted side are still 13 points from safety with just four points.",Sport/Football,"European roundup: Osasuna strike late to deny Barcelona, Empoli upset Napoli",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/12/european-roundup-osasuna-barcelona-napoli-empoli-inter-cagliari
12/13/2021,"Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccines, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to battle a “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. The army will be deployed across the country to help rapidly accelerate the vaccine programme and GPs will be told to cancel appointments to dedicate resources to offering vaccines to every UK adult by the end of December.  In a televised address to the nation on Sunday night, the prime minister said he was “afraid we are now facing an emergency in our battle with the new variant, Omicron, and we must urgently reinforce our wall of vaccine protection to keep our friends and loved ones safe.” Johnson, who is facing a major test of his authority this week as MPs rebel against new Covid restrictions, called the target “a national mission unlike anything we have done before in the vaccination programme”. It means vaccinating around 1 million people a day, up from 530,000 on Saturday. The UK record was 844,000 in March. All over-18s will be eligible from Monday and NHS booking will open for over-18s from Wednesday. On Sunday the Covid alert level was raised from three to four, indicating substantial pressure on the NHS, after a further 1,239 UK cases of Omicron were confirmed, nearly double the number reported the previous day. Omicron is expected to become Britain’s dominant variant within days. Announcing the booster offensive, Johnson said: “We know from bitter experience how these exponential curves develop. No one should be in any doubt: there is a tidal wave of Omicron coming.” He said two doses of vaccine were not enough, but scientists were confident that three would make a huge difference to protection. On Friday UK data suggested that three jabs provide 70-75% protection against infection with Omicron, while two doses given three or more months ago give 30% or less. GPs and other vaccinators will be required to prioritise jabs over non-urgent care and reduce the number of other face-to-face interactions. Johnson will also scrap the 15-minute post-jab wait in order to speed through even greater numbers of injections. Forty-two military planning teams will be deployed across every region of the UK, and there will be additional vaccine sites and mobile units. There will be extended opening hours with more appointments early in the morning, in the evening and at weekends, and thousands more volunteer vaccinators will be trained. Hospitals expect NHS England to declare a national incident within days, the Guardian has learned, making decision-making more centralised and likely leading to routine operations being cancelled with staff redirected. The prime minister said it could not be taken for granted that Omicron was causing less severe illness. “Do not make the mistake of thinking Omicron can’t hurt you, can’t make you and your loved ones seriously ill,” he said. Johnson is facing open war in the Tory party over the move to plan B restrictions, with the biggest rebellion since his election expected from MPs opposed to Covid passports for large venues and more mask wearing. Up to 100 MPs could oppose the changes on Tuesday as Johnson battles on multiple fronts to contain the damage from reports of a series of parties in Downing Street last year, which have left MPs openly discussing a vote of no confidence. The acceleration of the booster rollout, which will put Johnson under pressure to meet the target, is likely to be a key argument to reassure furious Tory MPs who have warned the prime minister they will not tolerate further restrictions. Johnson will offer a number of concessions to the rebels, starting with an announcement that from Tuesday contacts of Covid-19 cases will be able to take a lateral flow test every day instead of isolating if they have been vaccinated. The Guardian understands that the red list for travel is likely to be scrapped in the coming days, given the worldwide spread of Omicron. The change would mean there is likely to be no enforced hotel quarantine for people returning from southern Africa, though travellers may be required to isolate at home.",News/Politics,UK booster jab rollout to increase to 1m a day to battle Omicron ‘tidal wave’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/uk-booster-jab-rollout-to-increase-to-1m-a-day-to-battle-omicron-tidal-wave
12/13/2021,"Last month Jack Leach was out for dinner in Brisbane with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad when a local approached them. “Hey guys,” he said, “I just want to wish you the worst of luck at the Gabba.” So far, so tedious, but then the man added: “It’s going to be a green seamer.” This amused Leach, who was thinking: “I’m not sure that’s the best sledge to two of the greatest bowlers that England have ever had”. The joke was on that gloating Aussie, until it wasn’t – because the pitch was indeed a greentop, and England somehow omitted both their old maestros. Anderson, OK: save him for Adelaide, where he has a far better record. But Broad?! He loves Brisbane, he relishes a scrap, he lives for the Ashes, and when he fills in the form for room-service breakfast, he writes “David Warner, on toast”. England had to pick Broad, had to bowl first, had to keep it simple, had to play to their strength.  When England were enjoying their best moment, 220 for two with Joe Root and Dawid Malan cruising along at the close on Friday, the predictor on CricViz was still saying they’d be all out for 298. It seemed harsh, but was all too fair: they made 297. Since time immemorial, they have always had a collapse up their sleeve, and this one began even before the second new ball. Again and again, their batters were bamboozled by the bounce: of their 20 wickets, 13 were caught in the cordon from keeper to gully. Three of those nicks came off Cameron Green, the gangling greenhorn who threatens to fix Australia’s one traditional weakness – not producing all-rounders. Ashes to Ashes, rust to dust – if Warner don’t getcha, Travis Head must. England gave both of them gifts by dropping catches and missing run-outs. And the price they paid came in more than mere runs. Fielding is not just fielding: it’s a marker of morale, professionalism, pride and togetherness. Of the elements of the game, it’s the easiest for the underdog to shine at – as New Zealand have shown, all the way to the World Test Championship. England’s specialist seamers, never seen before as a unit and given no runs to play with, acquitted themselves well in the circumstances. Mark Wood was rapid and unlucky, Ollie Robinson forensic as ever, Chris Woakes respectable if mild-mannered. But Australia still scored far too fast: their innings of 425 took only nine more balls than England’s 297. They helped themselves to eight sixes while conceding none. They picked on poor Leach, and even bullied the normally bullish Ben Stokes. After five months out, England’s talisman leaked runs and bowled several blatant no-balls. He’s not the messiah, then, just a very rusty guy. Root is usually good at giving interviews straight after defeats, perhaps because he’s had a lot of practice. He is always likable, largely honest, and quick to take responsibility (are you paying attention, prime minister?). But he slipped up this time: by insisting that he’d been right to bat first, and to leave out both Anderson and Broad, he ended up defending the indefensible. He talked about “lessons to learn” while showing he hadn’t managed to see what they were. If he and Chris Silverwood were managing a football team, they would have been sacked three times this year. But all is not lost – yet. The pink ball is a leveller, and for the first time it will feature twice in the series. The next two venues are Adelaide and Melbourne, the Australian grounds where England bowl best. The last Test is at Hobart, where Australia have lost two of their last four. Those are the three England have to win (they gave up on Sydney, where the ball turns, the moment they spurned Matt Parkinson’s promising leg-spin). Haseeb Hameed, Ollie Pope and Jos Buttler have all shown some intent. If they can turn their 20s and 30s into 120s and 130s, and Root can extend his batting masterclass, and Stokes can be himself again, and Anderson and Broad can manage a swansong, we could just witness a contest.",Sport/Sport,Five things England must fix before the second Ashes Test | Tim de Lisle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/12/cricket-ashes-england-australia-five-things-joe-root
12/13/2021,"Good morning. The Queensland border has reopened to the fully vaccinated after nearly five months as WA prepares to announce its reopening plan. The US grapples with the aftermath of devastating tornadoes. And Russian missiles have been spotted near Ukraine border. A person in NSW has been admitted to hospital infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the first Omicron patient to be hospitalised since it arrived in Australia last month. Meanwhile, Queensland throws open its borders today, with thousands expected to queue to enter the state and authorities are urging drivers to be patient as they conduct checks. And the WA premier, Mark McGowan, is finally announce his state’s reopening plan today. It is the last jurisdiction in Australia to do so.  The tornadoes that hit the US on Friday are feared to have killed at least 100 people. On Saturday at least five central and southern US states reported deaths after what Joe Biden said was “likely to be one of the largest tornado outbreaks in our history”, with an estimated 22 tornadoes touching down. Dozens remained unaccounted for on Sunday as rescuers worked overnight searching for survivors in a trail of destruction from Arkansas to Kentucky. Biden has asked the US environmental protection agency to investigate what role the climate crisis might have played. Experts have said tornadoes with such intensity are rare later in the year during colder weather, and that Friday night’s storms, which included one tornado tearing a path of more than 225 miles across Kentucky, appeared to be an anomaly. The Guardian has gathered photos of the aftermath. Foreign ministers of the G7 group of rich democracies have warned Russia of “massive consequences” if it invades Ukraine and urged it to de-escalate its military buildup on its border. The British foreign secretary has said all forms of economic sanctions against Russia are on the table if it makes an incursion into Ukraine. But this does not seem to be stopping Russia. A sighting of Vladimir Putin’s notorious Buk missiles on their way to the frontline suggest Russia is inching closer to being ready to launch a full-scale ground invasion. After a man who bludgeoned his teenage girlfriend to death escaped a murder charge by arguing he had been provoked by her tales of infidelity, the Queensland government decided to step in. But a decade later, the government’s reforms have done little to stop men from successfully arguing they are guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, on the grounds that they were provoked. The government is on track for deficits totalling nearly $240bn over four years, according to Deloitte Access Economics, marking an estimated improvement of $100bn since the last budget. Primary teachers in Victoria say children have not only suffered academically from lockdowns, they have also missed out on two deeply formative years of socialisation of school. Upgrades to the Newell Highway near Goondiwindi on the Queensland-NSW border are changing the way water flows across the floodplain and affecting farms and ecosystems, according to local residents and experts. Paris, London and Brussels have dropped talks of a trade war and agreed to issue more post-Brexit fishing licences. But the offer did not fully meet the demands of Emmanuel Macron’s government and fishers in Brittany said they would go ahead with a planned blockade, claiming they had been “abandoned by the European Commission”. Naftali Bennett is to make the first official visit by an Israeli prime minister to the United Arab Emirates since the two countries established diplomatic ties last year. Globally, the superyacht industry is booming – and the number of vessels under construction or on order worldwide has hit a new record. Amanda Gorman, who became the youngest inauguration poet in US history when Joe Biden was sworn in as president, says she is attempting to “preserve the public memory of a pandemic” in a new collection published this week. It was hard enough being a long-distance dad. But when Covid hit and travel became more difficult, Xand van Tulleken worried about not being there for his son.

12/13/2021,"The US government’s leading infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, on Sunday stepped up calls for Americans to get a Covid-19 booster shot, as the US is approaching 800,000 lives lost to coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Fauci warned that the Omicron variant appeared to be able to “evade” the protection of two initial doses of the mRNA-type Covid vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech’s and Moderna’s – as well as post-infection therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma.  Omicron is spurring new fears as US infections begin to surge again, with infections currently still led by the highly-transmissable Delta variant that has dominated since the summer. Fauci said an extra vaccine shot provides “optimal” protection against Omicron, even though the government’s official designation of “fully vaccinated” remained at two doses of Pfizer or Moderna, or one of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which was developed by another method. “Preliminary data show that when you get a booster, for example a third shot of an mRNA, it raises the level of protection high enough that it then does do well against the Omicron,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president, said on ABC. It was, he said: “Another reason to encourage people who are not vaccinated to get vaccinated, but particularly those who are vaccinated to get boosted because that diminution in protection seems to go way back up again. If you want to be optimally protected, you really should get a booster.” Although vaccination rates, particularly boosters, have picked up significantly in recent weeks, about 40% of eligible adults in the US are still not fully protected, and the take-up rate for children ages five to 11, who are newly eligible, remains below 20%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. “Follow the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines, that when you are in an indoor congregate setting and you don’t know the vaccination status of the people around you, wear a mask. Masking is not going to be forever but it can get us out of the very difficult situation we’re in now,” Fauci said. Experts are still discovering the characteristics of Omicron. CDC director Rochelle Walensky last week said that very preliminary data so far showed Omicron was comparatively mild. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, meanwhile, defended his new vaccine mandate for private employees. “Omicron is here, it’s all over the country, this variant moves fast,” he said on CNN’s State of the Union show. “We have to move faster. What I hear from our business community, their greatest fear is shutdowns, going back to where we were in 2020, to restrictions, to people losing their livelihood. “The greatest threat to employment is that Omicron and the cold winter months are going to supercharge Covid and take us backwards. Since I put mandates in place starting in August, we have seen over a million more doses, 71% of our people fully vaccinated. A lot of those people made the decision because the mandate was there,” he said. A federal judge is set to rule on Tuesday on a challenge to De Blasio’s vaccine mandate for the city’s 160,000 public sector employees, including police, firefighters and sanitation workers.",News/US news,"Fauci urges Americans to get Covid booster as US nears 800,000 deaths",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/12/fauci-covid-omicron-booster-shots
