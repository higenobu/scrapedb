4/9/2022,"For a brief moment, it looked like the longstanding love affair between most of Europe’s rightwing, nationalist, anti-immigration and EU-critical politicians with Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin would prove a fatal mistake. Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has certainly embarrassed them. But so far at least, it does not appear to have done them terminal harm. A newcomer to the scene, France’s Eric Zémmour, whose extreme Islamophobic rhetoric has done much to make Marine Le Pen seem reasonable, has seen his poll ratings plunge in part because of his previous avowed admiration for Moscow. But Le Pen, despite extensive cosying-up to Putin (including at least one Kremlin meeting with the Russian president, support for his annexation of Crimea, and campaign loans from Moscow banks) has barely been affected by it at all. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, Moscow’s greatest ally among EU leaders, has just been returned to power for a fourth term. Italy’s Matteo Salvini may have been shamed by a Polish mayor for his Putin T-shirt, but his problems long pre-date that. Polling in the Netherlands for Geert Wilders, who felt obliged to call Putin’s war “a blatant and condemnable violation of Ukrainian sovereignty”, has edged down, but hardly dramatically, despite his long years of strident pro-Russian rhetoric. Certainly, the conflict has deprived the far right of a core pitch to voters: its dire warnings of the impact of mass immigration. Most Europeans have responded to Europe’s worst refugee crisis since the second world war with open arms. But Putin’s war could also bring the populists a major boost as the cost of sanctions against Russia starts to bite with soaring energy and food prices. Le Pen’s decision to concentrate her campaign on cost-of-living issues has already proved far-sighted. Petrol is already over €2 a litre, far higher than the level that sparked France’s gilets jaunes rebellion, and electricity, gas and bread prices are surging. Add in the costs of the green transition, and far from being harmed by their Putin ties, Europe’s far-right populists could be heading for an electoral bonanza. Hungary’s self-confessedly “illiberal” leader was sufficiently emboldened by his election victory to declare that his brand of “Christian democratic, conservative, patriotic politics … is the future” – and to take a dig not just at “Brussels bureaucrats” but at Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, too. In power since 2010, Orbán has flouted democratic norms, tightening the noose around academics, NGOs and the media and restricting freedoms for migrants and gay people. He also stands accused of diverting millions in EU funds to friends and family. With Orbán safely installed for another term, a victory for his ally Le Pen would transform the right’s impact on the EU. An outlier among Europe’s nationalist-conservative politicians because of his longstanding warnings about Moscow’s true intentions, Poland’s de facto leader has seen his ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party gain a polling boost from the war, which has transformed his country into an EU good guy for its fierce opposition to Russia and gargantuan humanitarian effort over Ukrainian refugees. But the government’s bitter rule-of-law dispute with Brussels over judicial independence, its culture-war attacks on the LGBTQ+ community and abortion rights, and its bridge-building with anti-EU, pro-Putin figures such as Salvini and Le Pen show little sign of abating. Kaczyński, too, would welcome a Le Pen presidency for his ongoing tussle with Brussels, although the two would differ radically over Russia policy. Italy’s former deputy prime minister congratulated Orbán on his win in typically bombastic terms: “Bravo Viktor! Alone against everyone, attacked by the fanatics of uniform thinking, threatened by those wanting to eradicate Europe’s Judeo-Christian roots, slandered by those wanting to eliminate values such as the family, security and freedom, you won again.” But since entering the country’s broad coalition government, the populist Italian leader of the League has been eclipsed in the polls by his far-right nationalist sometime rival, Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers of Italy, with whom he will probably need to cooperate ahead of elections in spring next year. Polling at a steady 19-20% of the vote, the populist Sweden Democrats party and its leader have moved away from a longstanding anti-Nato stance and now no longer rule out joining the alliance “if the security situation worsens even more”. They have also abandoned their former policy of leaving the EU, saying – like many of Europe’s far-right parties – that they now want to reform the bloc from the inside. A hardliner on crime and particularly immigration, Åkesson could potentially join a rightwing coalition headed by the opposition Moderates party after September’s Swedish elections. Spain’s far-right Vox party entered a regional government for the first time last month under a deal with the rightwing Popular party that could offer a blueprint for future power-sharing between the two parties after the next general election, due by the end of 2023. Founded in 2014, Abascal’s party has become the country’s third-largest political force by exploiting culture war issues, railing against political correctness, fomenting discontent with Spain’s two main political parties and capitalising on the fallout from the 2017 Catalan independence crisis.",News/World news,Rise of the far right: will there be an election bonanza for Europe’s populists?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/far-right-europe-rise-elections
4/9/2022,"With a brisk and bracingly cold sea breeze buffeting the red, green and yellow trade union flags in bright sunshine, the protest at P&O’s Scottish ferry port had the air of a labour movement revivalist rally. Union leaders railed against P&O’s bosses and the Conservative government in Westminster, demanding legal action and boycotts, applauded by Labour’s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, who then led the march to the shuttered P&O terminal at Cairnryan on the Irish Sea. That revivalist air suits Sarwar. His party’s fortunes appear to be improving, on the eve of his first electoral test as Scottish Labour leader, the local elections in May. For the first time since 2017, opinion polls this year have consistently shown Labour coming second in Scotland, replacing the Tories as the main challengers to Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish National party. Party leaders are habitually cautious about snapshot polls; they capture mood, not voters’ behaviour or turnout. However, one poll has particularly excited Sarwar. Last week, Survation put Labour on 27% for a Westminster election (excluding undecideds) – the highest it has polled for five years. During the worst months under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Scottish Labour’s support slumped to 13%. With those kind of numbers, Sarwar believes, Labour could regain a host of Scottish seats at the next general election. Every extra point north of 27% means several more Commons gains, he believes, and that boosts Keir Starmer’s chances of becoming prime minister. Sarwar has argued vociferously that Scotland was Labour’s original “red wall”: it was where the party’s support collapsed first, at the 2015 general election, holding only one Westminster seat in a humiliating rout at the hands of the SNP. Survation’s recent poll, commissioned by Ballot Box Scotland, a political blog, also found that for May’s council elections, Labour attracted 23% of the vote, against 18% for the Tories, and 44% for the SNP. “What I’m confident about is that Scottish Labour is back on the pitch, that Scottish Labour is changing, and that that is starting to resonate with people again,” Sarwar told the Observer, as the P&O protests continued behind him. “There’s still a very long way to travel. The latest trends are positive, but I’m not in this to come second. I’m in this to come first.” But, say Labour insiders and the elections expert Sir John Curtice, this modest Labour renaissance is coming from anti-independence swing voters disillusioned with the Tories under Boris Johnson following the partygate scandals at Downing Street. There is no sign the prime minister is enjoying a boost in support because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Labour strategists are cautious about their chances on 5 May, when the party hopes to improve on the 262 seats won in the 2017 Scottish local elections. Scotland uses the single transferrable vote system of proportional representation in council elections, which asks voters to rank candidates in order of preference. SNP supporters have the lowest propensity to vote, but unless nationalist voters stay at home in very large numbers, Labour can only cannibalise votes from other pro-UK parties to succeed. It needs to see floating unionist voters switch to Labour, or for Tory and Liberal Democrat supporters to vote tactically to keep pro-independence SNP and Green candidates at bay. It is very rare for SNP voters to lend Labour their second or third votes; those are most likely to go to the Scottish Green party, which is in coalition with the SNP at Holyrood. Sturgeon is facing significant and challenging questions about her government’s economic competence: there have been disclosures about costly delays to two vitally important new Hebridean ferries, anger over councils being short-changed in the recent Scottish budget and local services being cut. But even that is unlikely to dent the SNP’s vote next month, Curtice believes. Repeated attitudinal polling shows that in Scotland a voter’s preferences are almost entirely defined by where they stand on the constitution. The normal policy and service delivery disputes are “irrelevant” to most voters, he said. Curtice argues that Scotland’s political landscape has strong parallels with the constitutional divisions underlying Northern Irish politics, where no Irish nationalist could ever vote for the Democratic Unionist party. “It’s all now a quasi-referendum,” Curtice said. “That division is even sharper now than the one over Brexit south of the border in 2019.” Standing alongside Sarwar in the sunshine at Cairnryan was Elaine Murray, the outgoing Labour leader of Dumfries and Galloway council, where 10 Labour councillors shared power with 10 SNP councillors to keep the Tories, which were the largest party with 16 seats, out of office. She is retiring in May but sees, she says, consistent evidence of unionist voters switching back to Labour. Despite heavy pressure from Labour’s left, including whispering from some of Starmer’s advisers, to be more accommodating over the case for an independence referendum, Sarwar has taken a hardline stance against independence. Combined with Sarwar’s much greater visibility and name-recognition, as the son of the UK’s first Muslim MP, Mohammed Sarwar, Murray thinks voters are shifting markedly away from the Tories. “On the doorstep, things are improving,” she said. “We’re seeing people who left us in 2016 and 2017 coming back. It is because of Boris.”",News/UK news,Scottish Labour sees chance of revival as polls show voters turn from Tories,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/09/scottish-labour-revival-polls-may-elections
4/9/2022,"As the night train from Moscow pulled into Vilnius central station for its scheduled 10-minute stop, a curious pair of eyes peeked through one of its windows – only to disappear behind a hastily closed curtain. The passengers on the train were heading to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, which can be accessed via rail only by crossing through Lithuania, and on the platform outside they were faced with images of war and destruction. Twenty-four large photographs, graphically depicting bombed-out Ukrainian cities, dead Ukrainian children and bloodied Ukrainian bodies with shrapnel wounds, have been installed here by Lithuania’s rail provider LTG, which also provides the locomotive that pulls the Russian carriages through EU territory. They all carry the same message in Russian, which is repeated through the public address system as the train stops: “Today, Putin is killing civilians in Ukraine. Do you support this?” “People in Russia don’t have much access to unbiased information,” said Mantas Dubauskas, an LTG spokesperson. “Maybe we can change the minds of just a couple of passengers.” The installation at Vilnius central station is symbolic of a Baltic nation that doesn’t so much look cowed by the war in a fellow former Soviet state, as emboldened to tell the world it needs finally to stand up to Russia. In the first few days after Russian troops stepped on to Ukrainian soil on 24 February, anxiety spread around Lithuania, which has been an independent republic since 1990 and a member of Nato since 2004. “It brought up a lot of historic fears in my country,” said Linas Kojala, director of the Eastern Europe Studies Centre thinktank. “I had dozens of messages from friends asking what would happen next. Some asked if they should leave the country, maybe to Spain or Portugal. You just have to look at a map of the region to feel uncomfortable.” The southernmost of the three Baltic EU countries, Lithuania borders Kaliningrad to its west and Belarus to its east – a military corridor between the exclave and the client state would cut the Baltic states off from the rest of Europe. But within days of the start of Russia’s invasion, anxiety in the Baltics had transformed into resolve. In the centre of Vilnius, Ukrainian flags outnumber Lithuanian ones, with the yellow and blue draped around government buildings, sprayed on old city walls or wrapped as scarves around shopfront mannequins. On 1 April Lithuania became the first EU country to announce that it had abandoned Russian gas, instead meeting its energy demands via a floating LNG terminal in the port town of Klaipėda. It was also one of the first EU countries to downgrade its diplomatic ties with the Kremlin after reports of war crimes emerged from Bucha, withdrawing its own top diplomat from Moscow and asking the Russian ambassador to leave the Lithuanian capital. The message was visually underlined by an art performance just a stone’s thrown from the Russian Federation’s diplomatic base in Vilnius: last Wednesday morning, Lithuanian Olympic champion Rūta Meilutytė took a swim in a nearby pond that had been coloured blood-red with natural dye. “We wanted to remind people how important it is to keep looking at what Russian aggression is doing,” said Berta Tilmantaite, a journalist and artist who helped organise the protest. “I can understand why people look away or get tired of the news. “But in Lithuania we know Russia, and we don’t feel scared at this moment,” Tilmantaite told the Observer. “We feel a lot of determination.” Anyone wanting to know what’s driving Lithuania’s prominent stance at this juncture in history needn’t look much further than Vilnius’s Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights. Located in the former KGB headquarters across from Lukiškės Square, the museum tells the story of how the Soviet Union in June 1940 delivered Lithuania with an ultimatum to allow Red Army troops to cross its borders. Tensions between Moscow and Vilnius had been rising after the Soviet foreign minister accused Lithuania of torturing and killing three of its soldiers. With Russian troops massed on its borders already outnumbering its own, the Lithuanian government handed over the country to a puppet regime. Most of the exhibition space at the museum is given to those partisans who continued to fight for independence nonetheless. Migle Kriksciunaite, 25, was visiting the museum into the afternoon sun with her parents. Were there lessons that the rest of Europe could learn from Lithuania’s history? “The lesson our history teaches us is quite simple,” she said. “Fight for your freedom. It’s that straightforward.”",News/World news,‘Putin is killing civilians’: the train station where Russians are greeted with images of war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/slugs-russian-commuters-kaliningrad-vilnius-station-lithuania-war-photographs

My sister bought it for me and I’ve been recommending it to everyone. It won the 2021 Costa first novel award and the fact that it’s his debut is kind of nuts.

4/9/2022,"In a small subterranean office at the Admiralty, a cluster of men and women wait in a state of agonising anticipation. The Allied forces are landing in Sicily, and this small group of intelligence operatives has just bet the invasion – tens of thousands of lives – on a prankish piece of spycraft involving the body of a homeless man dressed as a pilot, carrying false news of an attack on Greece. It’s a second world war legend whose real story is no less strange than the myth that surrounds it – and something about it has clearly caught the zeitgeist. On Tuesday a new British film revisits the story of one of the greatest single deceptions in warfare, with an all-star cast and an Oscar winner at the helm. Directed by John Madden, of Shakespeare in Love fame, Operation Mincemeat stars Colin Firth as Ewen Montagu, the former King’s Counsel who oversaw the extraordinary plan, alongside an ensemble of some of the nation’s best-loved actors, from Penelope Wilton and Simon Russell Beale to Jason Isaacs and Kelly Macdonald. At the end of the month, meanwhile, a very different take will be seen on the banks of the Thames, at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. SpitLip’s Operation Mincemeat may share the same title as the movie, but it certainly doesn’t share the same approach, or a budget that can stretch to submarines packed with extras. In their comedy musical, which began life on the fringe, all the parts are played by the five-strong company, with gender-swapped roles and songs that include a Beyoncé tribute in the MI5 typing pool and a creepy pathologist channelling Cabaret. The real-life plot was anything but simple. In 1943, Britain and its allies were preparing to land an invasion force in Sicily – but it was an obvious target, and Germany were known to be expecting the attack. As part of a campaign to mislead the German high command into diverting troops elsewhere, two naval intelligence officers, Montagu and Charles Cholmondeley, worked up a scheme to send false information back to Hitler. Having sourced a dead body – that of a homeless man who had died eating rat poison – they created a false identity for the corpse, and conveyed it to the coast of Spain in a submarine. Dressed as “Major William Martin”, it was released to wash up on shore carrying sensitive documents that confirmed the invasion was actually to take place in Greece. German spies in neutral Spain were expected to fall for the false intelligence and pass the word back to Berlin. It was a high-stakes plan, and its execution was riddled with fumbles, twists and reversals – but it ultimately succeeded, allowing the Allies to land their troops in Italy with minimal resistance. The sudden re-emergence of interest in this wartime tale is, in one sense, pure serendipity. The productions were conceived entirely independently, and both were put on hold for two years by Covid. But neither would have been possible without the declassification of the secret files that revealed the true circumstances of the operation – or the publication, in 2010, of a book by Ben Macintyre that pulled the various strands together. It was Macintyre who revealed just how close the operation had come to disaster, as well as the identity of Glyndwr Michael – the man whose body was effectively stolen and used as a decoy. The book was used as the basis for the film; Macintyre is delighted that the story – which was made into a postwar propaganda movie, The Man Who Never Was, in 1956 – is being told for a new generation. “One of the reasons it lends itself to being reimagined in lots of different ways is that the whole plot was imagined,” he says. “What appeals to me is that it’s filled with people making it up – they were all frustrated novelists.” That has become a central theme in the new film, which highlights Ian Fleming’s role as the originator of the idea, before following Montagu’s team – which included his partner-in-espionage, Cholmondeley, the head of the secretarial division Hester Leggett and her protege Jean Leslie – as they develop their plan into an increasingly labyrinthine deception. “They got completely obsessed by it, really,” says Macintyre. “They began to make up more and more about William Martin, including a girlfriend, a bank manager and an angry father, forever adding to the plot.” At one stage in the film Cholmondeley – played by Matthew Macfadyen – declaims that he’s surrounded by them. Germans? someone asks. “Writers,” he replies. What makes an 80-year-old event, one that has gained almost folklore status, feel relevant today is our knowledge that this kind of extreme disinformation is once again being manufactured in the context of a European war. “Deception works if it appeals to the person being deceived in some way,” Macintyre points out. “So they created one designed to appeal to a romantic sensibility on the other side. “It has a grim modern resonance. Smoke and mirrors, trying to command the narrative and persuade the other side that something is happening that isn’t, or something isn’t happening that is. That’s central to what’s going on in Ukraine. But it’s an art as old as war.” “All the terrible things we see people doing, the British did it first,” agrees David Cumming, who plays Cholmondeley in the musical version. When his SpitLip collaborator Natasha Hodgson brought the idea to the collective, Cumming initially resisted: “I was like, really? A musical about the war? Who needs to talk about the war any more?” But the more he delved into the details, the more he saw both opportunities and merits in a modern telling. “We didn’t want the kind of jingoism inherent in a story of ‘beating the Boche’, so it was important that our show wasn’t five white men saying ‘Aren’t we great? We won the war’.” Instead, the stage show’s comic power rests in its ability to subvert expectation and provide a revisionist commentary on the establishment figures blessed with both the freedom and the extraordinary self-belief to pull off what still seems a ridiculous plan. Montagu is played by Hodgson herself, which adds a layer of meta-theatrical meaning to his daring swagger. “It’s a quietly queer show,” says Cumming, “in that you read that level of entitlement as something that’s been learned, not something inherent in a man.” Meanwhile the female figures – Leggett, who wrote the love letters that helped convince the enemy that Martin was a real man, and Leslie, with whom Montagu carried on a flirtation – are given their own narratives. It’s also made clear where the barriers begin and their agency ends. The establishment is not, of course, a popular concept either in politics or culture right now. When SpitLip first staged Operation Mincemeat in a tiny venue in north London in 2018, the audience reactions were very different from those it has received since returning post-Covid. “It’s been really interesting doing it while Boris has been prime minister,” says Hodgson. “People react so strongly to those characters. The first time we staged it, the comedy of these posh lads running the country felt more slapstick and silly, whereas now it feels more like satire. It only shows you how stupid politics has become.” You certainly don’t get that kind of commentary in Madden’s somewhat conventional film – after all, you can’t hire an upper lip much stiffer than Firth’s – but it does at least nod at the ethical ambiguity of the government’s requisitioning a man’s body without getting his family’s consent (another thing the stage show is outspoken about). “With lots of the war stories you inherit, there are the goodies and the baddies, and war isn’t really like that,” says Macintyre. “Good people do bad things for the best reasons. This allows us to see it in a more human light, through flawed and complicated individuals. “It’s about asking the question: what would you do? Which of these people would you have been? And that’s an eternal question.” Cumming agrees: “It speaks to the feeling of when something huge and outside of yourself and far away is happening and you feel hopeless and useless and don’t know what to do. We felt it with the pandemic and it’s rushing more scarily towards us with the war and the horrifying stuff going on there.” There’s a number in the stage show which manages to combine zany rap lyrics with the sobering message that fascism hasn’t disappeared since 1945 – that its ideologies are still being sold, with increasing success. No one on either Operation Mincemeat project could have known that their work would be emerging at a time when the fate of Europe once again felt in the balance, but the work of Montagu, Cholmondeley, Leggett and Leslie clearly didn’t just alter the course of military history: its legacy lives on. There’s even a GCHQ training programme entitled Operation Mincemeat, which teaches intelligence operatives how to create a fake identity online – complete with believable backstory, of course.",Arts/Film,Operation Mincemeat: the startling story of deception that fooled Hitler and helped win the war,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/09/operation-mincemeat-war-story-allies-deception-film-play
4/9/2022,"Since I first saw it last year, I can’t stop rewatching that minute in Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary when Paul McCartney, noodling around on his guitar in front of a yawning George and Ringo, locates the chords and words to Get Back. Accounts of McCartney’s facility for melody – waking up with Yesterday in his head – have long been parables of the creative process, but seeing, in Jackson’s film, a song that all the world is about to know take form in real time is to witness something like a casual miracle. Speaking to Newsnight on Friday, Ed Sheeran suggested that such footage may become a legal necessity. Of his courtroom victory against claims of plagiarism in his song Shape of You brought by the grime artist Sami Switch, Sheeran noted how these days in the studio he employs a version of CCTV to ensure no hook or bass line is seen to be stolen. “I just film everything,” he said. “We’ve had claims come through on the songs and we go, ‘Well, here’s the footage… You’ll see there’s nothing there’.” The most famous case of musical borrowing was upheld against George Harrison, whose My Sweet Lord appeared to lift the structure of the 1963 hit He’s So Fine. Sheeran, the most prolific of current melody makers, is desperate, he suggested, not to get to “the George Harrison point where he was scared to touch the piano because he might be touching someone else’s note”. Still, it seems that the kind of big bang euphoria of Get Back appearing out of the ether will be a thing of the past. Songwriters will become like Premier League strikers, waiting for the verdict of VAR before they can celebrate a goal. Over the course of this weekend, the centenary of TS Eliot’s masterpiece The Waste Land is being celebrated in a festival of music and performance at 22 London churches. Scanning the programme, one crucial component seemed to be neglected. There was no aria or ragtime segment in praise of editors. It’s always worth remembering that were it not for the red-pen interventions of Eliot’s friend, Ezra Pound, the opening line of the poem would not have been “April is the cruellest month”, but “First we had a couple of feelers down at Tom’s place”. And the gospel voices this weekend might have been hymning something titled not The Waste Land but He Do the Police in Different Voices. Watching Tiger Woods force himself around the Masters course after his car accident, I remembered commissioning a profile for this paper, exactly 25 years ago, just before he first sauntered out at Augusta. I dug that piece out to reread it, as a kind of before and after. The story quoted Woods’s father, Earl, the retired Green Beret lieutenant colonel: “Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of humanity,” he prophesied. “More than Gandhi?” his interviewer asked. “Yes, because he’s qualified through his ethnicity to accomplish miracles. He’s the bridge between east and west. He’s the chosen one. The world is just getting a taste of his power.” Watching Woods’s face a quarter of a century on, you tend, as with all sporting greats in their last act, to see not the enormous triumphs of his career, but the apparent torments of never quite living up to that impossible billing.

4/9/2022,"Cathy O’Neil is a writer, a mathematician and author of the bestselling Weapons of Math Destruction, which won the Euler book prize. Her latest book is The Shame Machine: Who Profits in the New Age of Humiliation, which looks at the ways shame is manufactured and exploited in a range of industries, including prisons, welfare systems and social media, for coercive and commercial purposes. She argues that a common intention is to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals. This is a very different book to your previous one. What made you decide to write about the subject of shame?I first became really interested in shame while researching Weapons of Math Destruction. I talked to teachers who had been evaluated by a secret scoring system. And they were sometimes getting fired or denied tenure. When I asked if somebody had explained the formula to them, they said they were told it was math and they wouldn’t understand. That silenced them. It was shame as a systematic mechanism. What, by your own understanding, constitutes shame? Is it universal?It’s universal. But shaming always happens with respect to a norm. And those norms aren’t necessarily universal. Shame is a social thing that happens in the context of feeling like you’re unworthy and you’ll be unlovable by your community. There are a few universal norms around shaming; like sex – there’s always some way to get shamed if you do it wrong. So you can try to shame somebody to behave well with respect to a norm. And then the question is, when does that work and when is it appropriate? You talk about shame in terms of its commercial exploitation by “shaming machines”. But is it different to or greater than the exploitation of other emotions, like sexual desire, vanity and insecurity?I think they have a lot to do with shame. Certainly, insecurity is a notion of feeling only contingently acceptable. So it’s sort of the threat of shame. The first third of the book refers to traditional shame machines, like cosmetics for women, because they’re ashamed of looking old. The middle section refers to how big tech is making use of shame to profit from our interactions. I think that is a new development that relies quite directly on the ability to hijack our pre-rational, triggered reactions and the existential threat that shame represents to our psyche. Do algorithms target shame, or just anything that is popular?I think algorithms are optimised to service that which will arouse us the most. That usually means outraging us so we perform shame. In our filter bubble, our in-group, the algorithm serves to us the most outrageous thing that some other filter bubble has managed to arrive at, so we have the opportunity to be righteous and lob shame on to that other group, and to create this shame spiral. Are there such things as good shame and bad shame, shame that is beneficial, and shame that is harmful? If so, who makes that distinction and how?I think the answer is yes. And I put forth suggestions for how to think through that. I’m willing to be corrected, but the basic notions I suggest are that if you’re shaming somebody who cannot conform to the norm, or who has no voice, that’s inappropriate and bullying. That’s punching-down shame. The converse of that statement is that if you’re shaming somebody for something that they’ve chosen to do against the norm you share with that person, and they have the opportunity to defend themselves, then that is appropriate, or at least it’s not bullying. But that doesn’t mean it will work. You acknowledge that you could be accused of punching down by highlighting certain individuals in the book. As you write, “But I’m doing so in the hopes that we can all learn from it.” Isn’t that what everyone believes when they’re shaming people?Right. I did change quite a few names of people in the book, just to prevent a little bit of that extra shame falling on them. I agree with you. I think a lot of people do think of it as setting an example rather than purely punitive. I just don’t think jumping on a shame train of the latest Karen video [film of white women supposedly behaving in an entitled manner] sets an example that we need to see. You cite JK Rowling as an example of someone you think is punching down because she’s powerful, but she’s a woman who’s been threatened and called the most appalling things. Who’s punching down to whom?Yeah, it’s a great example of where it’s a grey area. What I hate about social media is how much attention we give to things that don’t really matter. Just the fact that I know what JK Rowling thinks about this is a waste of my brain. What I want by writing this book is a better conversation about shame. In the section on JK Rowling you segue into the example of George Wallace, the racist governor of Alabama, who was shot and paralysed, and then asked for forgiveness for his previous segregationist views. Does that seem an appropriate context to discuss Rowling, who has received many death threats?First of all, I didn’t know that JK Rowling had death threats. So I certainly didn’t mean to suggest that she would ever get shot, if that’s what you’re asking. No, but I’m not sure how an aggressive racist politician who was shot, and recanted, bears any comparison with Rowling.I don’t see the story that way. I think Wallace saw the error of his ways because Shirley Chisholm [the black Democratic congresswoman] visited him in hospital. And he recognised her humanity. It was a great example of someone who really reckoned with the shame of his past deeds and, not only at a personal level but at a social justice level, apologised in a really honest way. You discuss cancel culture in your book. Many people argue that it doesn’t exist. What’s your opinion?I think it’s real. When you hear people complain about it, they’re probably the people who have the fakest examples because the very fact you’re hearing them complain means they have a voice and a chance to defend themselves. But I do think cancel culture is more common and people fear speaking out and being wrong. I used to do a blog 10 years ago and I really experimented with ideas. It would be harder to do that blog now because back then I felt like my readers were giving me the benefit of the doubt. I think people who are less well known can be squashed more easily. If there was one change that you could make that would affect the shame machine, what would it be?I would want every institution, including social media companies but also in prisons and welfare systems and schools, to analyse the extent to which they have embedded punching-down shame in their policies and practices, and try to remove them.

4/9/2022,"Children who grow up in the lush mountain country of rural Mexico soon learn to spot danger. The dry rattle of a scorpion, the red, black and yellow banding of a venomous coral snake. And then there are the human threats: government helicopters that periodically drench the region in poison – a tactic in the war against drugs – and somehow never seem to target the opium poppy fields themselves, but rather the village and its environs. Ana (played by Ana Cristina Ordóñez González as a child and by Marya Membreño as an adolescent) has been trained by her mother to map out the sounds of the night – the film’s busy soundscape takes in crickets, barking dogs, a cow without an owner – in order to identify the one danger the villagers prefer not to talk about. The locals call them “those people”, as if to name them is to give them power: they are cartel foot soldiers, equipped with jeeps and automatic weapons, who tear through the community, snatching young girls from their families to be trafficked. This is an extraordinary, haunting first fiction feature from Mexican director Tatiana Huezo, best known for her 2016 documentary Tempestad. It captures the wary, precarious nature of a community that relies financially on the same forces – the rampaging drug cartels – that also terrorise it. Huezo taps into the intense vibration between young female friends who treasure each other above all else.

4/9/2022,"As thousands of angry cries and anti-government slogans filled the streets of the Sri Lankan city Colombo on Saturday, Chanda Upul stood quietly nearby, desperately pushing his wares of soft drinks and bottled water on protesters. But in his heart he was chanting along with them. As Sri Lanka has descended into its worst financial crisis since independence, with food, fuel, medicine and electricity becoming increasingly scarce, and calls for the president Gotabaya Rajapaksa – frequently referred to as Gota – to step down, 50-year-old Upul, who lives in a poor northern suburb of the city, is among those who have been pushed to the brink of survival. As petrol became scarce and expensive, Upul was no longer able to afford repayments on his rented rickshaw and lost his only means of income. Now he and his four children survive only on rice and water. Vegetables and milk powder are just too expensive these days. “The only thing we can do now is drink poison, we are finished,” said Upul. “I voted for Gota thinking he was a lion, now I can see that he is worse than a dog. I love my country but don’t know if there will be a country left for my children.” The impacts of Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown have barely left a corner of the country unscathed. There are the power cuts darkening homes and shop fronts for up to eight hours daily and forcing people to cook on scavenged wood while miles-long queues worm outside at petrol stations. School exams and newspapers have had to be cancelled because the government and media houses can’t afford the paper to print them on. Doctors have declared a medical crisis as pharmacies and hospitals are empty of crucial drugs, and warnings have been issued that starvation could be imminent for the country’s 22 million residents as food supplies are dwindling. In Colombo, police stand at road junctions because the traffic lights have been turned off. But nowhere can the seismic shift in the country be felt more than out on the streets. In recent weeks, protests unlike anything seen in Sri Lanka’s history have taken place across the country, driven not by an organised movement but fuelled instead by a collective rage at the politicians they blame for driving their country into the ground, leading to many describing it as “Sri Lanka’s Arab spring”. Swathes of those hitting the streets are Sri Lanka’s younger generation, furious at what they see as their own futures being set alight by the divisions and incompetencies of the older generation. Vasi Samudra Devi, a 26-year-old artist, said she was “incredibly afraid for what might happen”. “It’s everyone’s duty to be protesting, the situation here is so bleak for young people,” said Devi. “These corrupt politicians have stolen our money and destroyed our future. We deserve better than this.” Jehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, described the scale and scope of the protests as “absolutely unprecedented.” “The way people from all communities are coming out onto the streets, I have never seen it before,” he said. “ And it’s happening organically, there’s no mastermind or political party behind all of this. It’s very youth-driven but you’ve got middle-class people, elderly people, wealthy businessmen, families, people who have never protested before.” “The anger and enthusiasm isn’t dying down,” Perera added. “These protests are not going to end any time soon.” The wrath of the protesters across the country has mainly been targeted at Rajapaksa, the country’s strongman president who was elected in 2019 on the back of a fierce nationalist agenda. Part of Sri Lanka’s most powerful family dynasty, and in charge of the military during the final years of the Sri Lankan civil war, in which he stands accused of committing war crimes, he was long the most feared man in Sri Lankan politics. In the past two years, he amended the constitution to strengthen his own executive powers and five of his family members took up senior government posts, including his brother Mahinda, who is prime minister. But his government’s devastating economic decisions since taking power – including scrapping austerity measures when he came into power, cutting taxes to just 8% of GDP, printing vast amounts of money pushing up inflation, refusing to restructure the country’s mounting foreign debt and using up all the foreign reserves – have now made him the most derided man in Sri Lankan politics. The rallying cry of the protests has been “Gota go home”, a reference to his dual US citizenship. His entire cabinet resigned this week and more than 40 politicians defected from his ruling coalition to become independent, with one warning that “if we don’t act now, there will be a river of blood in the country”. But Rajapaksa has insisted he has no intention of resigning. “It’s quite evident he can’t run a government,” said Thiyagaraja Waradas, 35, a senior lecturer at university of Colombo attending a rally organised by the LGBT community. “The president must go: it’s the only way.” Waradas gestured out at the crowds, where national flags mingled with rainbow LGBT banners and trade union placards, to demonstrate the diversity and non-partisan nature of the demonstrations, highly unusual in a country still divided heavily down ethnic lines. Nearby, members of the Buddhist clergy stood in their orange robes solemnly calling for political accountability, and down the road, hundreds of workers from the IT sector could be heard shouting “error 404: democracy not found”. Later that day, the LGBT protest would merge with a Muslim-led rally where rainbow flags flew as Muslim families broke their Ramadan fast and handed out samosas. “The nature of this crisis is that nobody is left unaffected,” said Waradas. “Most of my friends struggle to pay rent, they have lost jobs, they don’t have food or medicines. They have almost left our people to die.” Charu, a 24-year-old student, also voiced his anger at the Rajapaksa dynasty, who have ruled Sri Lanka on and off since 2002. “This is all the fault of the Rajapaksas, with their poisonous nationalism and bad governance,” he said. “People are starving, we are in terrible debt because of him and we can’t even turn the lights on. But he is not taking responsibility.” Like many around him, Charu shook his head woefully when speaking of the future. “I have no hope,” he said. Many fear Sri Lanka is facing political deadlock as, under its system, Rajapaksa cannot be voted out by parliament. However, the main opposition party is preparing a no-confidence motion against his party in parliament. The opposition’s aim is that with the president in a weakened position, he will either step down or accept legislation that will reduce his powers, enabling them to form a new government out of his grasp. “Gotabaya has lost the confidence and legitimacy of the people, it’s impossible for him to continue,” said Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, of the Tamil National Alliance party which forms part of the opposition. On Saturday, thousands turned out at one of the biggest protests in Colombo so far, lining the pavements along the boardwalk where many of luxury developments, now considered unaffordable monuments to hubris, have been built over the past few years. Friends Nelum Leanage, 69, and Manel Rajakaruna, 72, stood among the crowds wrapped in Sri Lanka flags. “We want the president to return all the money he has robbed from us, then resign from politics and get out of this country,” said Leanage. “He doesn’t belong here yet he has stolen billions from us, he has a luxury life while we have nothing. Unlike him, with his US passport, we don’t have another country to go to.” Rajakaruna nodded her head vigorously in agreement. “Even during 26 years of war things never got this bad,” she said. “This is the worst I have ever seen the country.”",News/World news,‘We’re finished’: Sri Lankans pushed to the brink by financial crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/sri-lanka-financial-crisis-protesters-call-for-gotabaya-rajapaksa-resignation-please
