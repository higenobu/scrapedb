4/27/2022,"Whatever the origin or purpose of the vile, defamatory claims aimed at Angela Rayner, whether simply poisonous hate or repulsive distraction, it is hard to believe that these remarks emerged from a vacuum (Angela Rayner hits out at ‘sexism and misogyny’ in politics, 25 April). It is highly unlikely that Tory MPs, however rabid in their ignoble enthusiasms, would risk so much damage if they were not already accustomed to experiencing a favourable, if marginal, reception for their views. The confidently asserted whispers reported by the Mail on Sunday may have been horrendously misjudged but, as contemptible as they are, it is far more likely that they were miscalculated in their deployment, rather than wholly at odds with what is now an increasingly ugly strain in the Tory party. Thus, however much Boris Johnson and his acolytes may “deplore the misogyny” directed at Rayner, it is a monster that has risen from the noxious swamp that they are responsible for creating.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex  Aside from the misogyny, the notorious article in the Mail on Sunday criticising Angela Rayner also has a clear message for those of us not educated in the ways of Oxbridge debating conventions: stay in your place and leave government to the men from the right background who know best. The MoS article quoted a Conservative MP saying: “She knows she can’t compete with Boris’s Oxford Union debating training, but she has other skills which he lacks. She has admitted as much when enjoying drinks with us on the [Commons] terrace.” As if insulting Rayner and people who didn’t go to Oxford or Cambridge is not enough for the MoS, the article also insults Boris Johnson himself. The sources evidently believe that Johnson is so craven, the sight of a woman sitting down, wearing clothes, is likely to break his chain of thought. Presumably, the writer and his sources believe generally that the problem of boorish and sexist behaviour by men is in fact the fault of women, and its solution therefore lies with women’s behaviour – it simply beggars belief. Heaven forbid that talented and capable women like Rayner should be valued for their contribution to the workplace. The hateful nature of this article reveals a great deal about the Conservatives in Westminster under this prime minister, their pals in the rightwing press and of their relationship with a public that they hold in contempt.Nick SinclairAldeburgh, Suffolk  Isabel Hardman (So few can afford to stand for parliament, it’s no wonder we get the wrong MPs, 24 April) mentions Chris Bryant’s warning, saying that “the reputation of parliament itself is being tarnished by the behaviour of some of its occupants”. How apt, on the very day we hear that anonymous Tory MPs are getting hot under the collar about the supposedly provocative leg-crossing of Angela Rayner.

4/27/2022,"You cited a recent report byJack Watling and Nick Reynolds, my Royal United Services Institute colleagues (Johnson vows to stop UK exports to India ending up in Russia, 22 April), who rightly cautioned the need to vet British defence exports, specifically to seven countries, including India. That this is timely, lest dual-use components make their way to Vladimir Putin, merits no reiteration. But I must point out, in a year marking the 75th anniversary of the largest developing democracy, that institutionalised Indian oversight of its domestic armaments suppliers across public and private sectors, and a rules-bound administrative and judicial structure that robustly regulates civilian-military relations, has not only pre-empted individual or corporate drives and ambitions, but revealed an absence of rogue scientists, politicised soldiers and surreptitious sales to date. Iranians and Libyans got nowhere seeking fissile knowhow from India, which is widely known for abstaining from condemning Moscow at the UN, but not for cancelling a recent Russian order of MiG-29 jets or airlifting 90 tons of medical and humanitarian aid, via Slovakia and Poland, to Ukraine.Burzine WaghmarInaugural visiting India fellow, Royal United Services Institute  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/27/2022,"Even while hammering out the final details of his £35bn ($44bn) purchase of Twitter, Elon Musk took some time out this weekend to tweet. He likes tweeting, does the world’s richest man, usually from what he calls his “porcelain throne” (that detail disclosed on Twitter, naturally enough). This one was a photo of Bill Gates, zeroing in on the 66-year-old’s modest paunch and placing it next to a cartoon of a pregnant man. To that ensemble, Musk added this sentence of supreme wit: “in case u need to lose a boner fast”. You’ll read many titbits about Twitter’s new owner over the next few days. That he is worth some $265bn. That at his electric car company, Tesla, he is not titled chief executive or any other such mustiness, but “technoking”. That his youngest son is called X Æ A-Xii, which is obviously pronounced “X”, while his baby girl is nicknamed “Y”. But the most important thing to know about Musk is that he is a troll. Like all trolls, he sets out to offend and to upset, purely to get the world’s attention. Except Musk is not only better at trolling than anyone else, it is a vital part of both his business model and how he treats the world. And it is what makes his purchase of Twitter so dangerous. Trolls lurk below videos on YouTube, underneath articles on websites and on your social media feeds. They don’t wait on your invitation to respond, they couldn’t care less about your feelings, and they certainly won’t clear up the mess they create. And a good day at the office is one where they leave a mountain of mess. Musk’s post about Bill Gates, for instance, was retweeted more than 130,000 times. When Bernie Sanders tweeted, “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share,” Musk shot back, “I keep forgetting you’re still alive.” He dubbed a British cave explorer who helped to save 12 Thai schoolboys trapped inside a cave “pedo guy”, then shrugged it off as a bad joke. That wasn’t how Vernon Unsworth saw it. “I feel humiliated,” said the 64-year-old hero. “Ashamed. Dirtied.” There are no good defences of such vile bullying – and Musk has no good defence. Instead, he paints himself as a “free speech absolutist”, and claims it’s why he is shelling out so much for a website. This moral crusade he defines as “if someone you don’t like says something you don’t like, that is free speech”, which is an offering so flimsy a primary-school child might flinch from making it. How does such a rule sit alongside hate speech, libel, downright lies? But then the king of trolls has never had to consider such arguments – until this week, that is, when he bought himself the kingdom. Now Musk has all the free speech that money can buy, he will find these are not just abstract debates but are absolutely critical to the future of his most high-profile business venture. For a glimpse of the problem, consider the Massachusetts Institute of Technology study showing that false stories on Twitter are 70% more likely to be retweeted than the truth. What Musk today pitches as “the digital town square”, an agora for the era of globalisation, is often a machine to amplify lies. Droning on about the first amendment won’t solve that problem and it’s one that he will find induces much misery. The classic mistake made by analysts of Musk is to treat his trolling as a regrettable diversion from his real business of electric cars, space missions and all the rest. But the two seem to be essential to each other. Constant tweeting to more than 85 million followers is what allows the Tesla boss to spend next to nothing on advertising, while Toyota spends well over $1bn a year in advertising in the US alone. Making a noise and creating a stink also helps to keep Tesla stock so popular with small investors, who ensure it remains massively overvalued. The cliche goes that we all live in an attention economy, yet few ask who is raking in the dividends. It turns out that one of the biggest profiteers is Musk. Just as trolls love to trash digital commons they abhor institutions, those roomy places with rules and norms and a variety of people with their own interests and traditions. We live in an age of troll politics, with a Westminster troupe that hates our most renowned institutions. Boris Johnson can’t abide the BBC, pretends he loves the NHS and is about to sell Channel 4. Musk fits right into this era. He constantly attacks government, carps at stimulus spending and derided some of the public-health measures taken by Washington to limit the damage from Covid. And he has sometimes paid less as a proportion of his income to the US government than the typical teacher or factory worker. In 2018, the world’s richest man paid nothing in income tax at all, according to ProPublica. At the same time, his companies have taken all the government subsidies they can get – to open new factories, to explore space and to help its payroll. Don’t feed the trolls, one is sometimes advised. Well, one troll has been fed many billions of American taxpayer dollars. Yet Tesla has been accused of running factories more dangerous than a sawmill or a slaughterhouse. It responded in 2017 by saying: “We may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to become a car company, but what matters is the future.” Allegations about its treatment of African-American workers has put it on the receiving end of the biggest racial-discrimination lawsuit ever launched by California state government (accusations it vigorously denies). All of this is in the public domain and has been reported, yet publications from Time magazine to the FT keep making him man of the year. Of all the tech billionaires, Musk is the guy who has been least scrutinised and most lionised. Perhaps now that may change. The interesting parallel is with Jeff Bezos, who nearly a decade ago paid $250m for the Washington Post – a fraction of what Musk has just handed over for Twitter. The first man – for whom I do not have much love – bought an institution and invested in it. Few would dispute that the newspaper has flourished under his ownership. What is the most obvious thing Musk will probably do with his new toy? Reinstate Donald Trump’s account just in time for the US midterm elections. A troll president for the troll king. And who exactly is being trolled? If you have to ask that, take a look in the mirror.

4/27/2022,"The bandleader, songwriter, singer, saxophonist and keyboard player Orlando Julius, who has died aged 78, helped to transform the Nigerian music scene in the 1960s with highly commercial, ground-breaking fusions that influenced Fela Kuti’s Afrobeat. He began playing professionally as a teenager, working with leading musicians in Ibadan, a major Nigerian cultural centre, before starting his own band, the Modern Aces, in 1964. The group developed a strong local following thanks to Orlando’s experiments in mixing highlife and other African styles with American influences – and the young Fela took note. He regularly attended the band’s concerts at the University of Ibadan or the Independence hotel, and Orlando allowed him to join them on stage. Although Fela and Orlando had very different personalities – Orlando was easy-going, not interested in writing political songs and had a more conventional lifestyle – they were both adventurous musicians with eclectic tastes, and when Fela was ready to form his early band, Koola Lobitos, Orlando gave him some of his musicians to get him started. Later, in the mid-70s, Orlando moved to the US, where he recorded and toured with the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. Towards the end of his career he also won a cult following in the UK and continental Europe, recording and touring with the Heliocentrics, a London-based band. Born in Ikole Ekiti during the British colonial era, Orlando was the son of Adeojo Ekemode, a trader and shopkeeper, and his second wife, Tinuola Dorcas, who farmed and made handwoven cloth. As a child he sang with his mother and played drums “while she worked on the yarn … and I knew that music was the way for me”. He played the drums and flute at St Peter’s Anglican school in Ikole, but left when he was 14, after the death of his father. Making his way to Ibadan, he worked at a bakery as he tried to get experience with local bands, initially playing drums in the Action Group, run by Jazz Romero, and studying at the Ibadan music school. He went on to work with other leading musicians, including Eddy Okonta and IK Dairo. They played highlife and juju styles, but Orlando had other ideas. “I was listening to John Coltrane, Otis Redding and Smokey Robinson, and wanted to make my own soul music,” he said. He was only 22 when he and the Modern Aces became household names in Nigeria with their single Jagua Nana, in which a woman is compared to a Jaguar car. It became a massive hit across the country thanks to its infectious, catchy riff and tight rhythm section, matched against sturdy horn playing and vocals. The song reappeared on Orlando’s first solo album, Super Afro Soul (1966), along with other hits including Topless and the James Brown-influenced Ijo Soul, plus a highlife treatment of Robinson and Ronald White’s My Girl. He went on to record further albums in Nigeria, responding to popular taste by introducing more funk, rock or Afrobeat influences into his songs and notching up more hit singles. When he relocated to the US in 1974 he based himself first in New York and then Washington, forming a new band, Umoja, that performed alongside stars such as Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield. Masekela, who was passing through Washington, heard Umoja playing at a rehearsal and joined in on flugelhorn when they played Ashiko, a rousing Orlando composition. Orlando was subsequently invited to join Masekela’s new African band, Ojah, and Masekela’s 1975 album The Boy’s Doin’ It (for which Orlando co-wrote the title track) included a glorious, lengthy treatment of Ashiko. He toured with Ojah for two years, also appearing on the 1976 album Colonial Man. In 1977 Masekela’s producer, Stewart Levine, was asked to produce an “African-American” album by the Motown singer and songwriter Lamont Dozier, and decided that his song Going Back to My Roots “should have an African chant on it”. He called Orlando, who turned up at the studio in double-quick time with half a dozen singers, and the recording was made in two hours. The song became a classic of the soul-disco era, and a cover version became a big international hit in 1981 for the New York group Odyssey. Orlando remained in the US until 1998, although in 1984 he had returned briefly to Nigeria to record the Dance Afro-Beat album (1985). Needing a dancer and backing singer at the time, he hired Latoya Gill. They got married in 2002, by which time Orlando had set up a recording studio in Nigeria and Latoya had begun to act as his manager. Although Orlando was largely ignored by western record companies during the “world music” era of the 80s and 90s, growing interest in African music led to “crate diggers” searching out his early recordings. In 2000 the British label Strut re-released Super Afro Soul, and further re-releases on other labels followed. Strut then invited him to team up with the Heliocentrics, with whom he released the popular and much-praised album Jaiyede Afro in 2014, supported with tours in Europe and Latin America. He greatly enjoyed his association with the band, who played their last gig with him in Mexico in January 2020. Almost everyone who encountered Orlando spoke of his openness and sense of humour, as well as his laid-back temperament. Malcolm Catto, the Heliocentrics’ drummer, said he had “never met anyone with so little ego”, while their bass-player, Jake Ferguson, described him as “a gentle giant, unique, a joy to be around”. He is survived by Latoya, a son, Kayode, from an earlier marriage, three children, Tunde, Juliet and Ajamu, from other relationships, Latoya’s children, Dettrick, Ibrm and Emaun, and two brothers, Kehinde and Olugbenda.

4/27/2022,"The German government has announced that it is to send a fleet of around 50 anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, as it attempts to offset criticism that it has been too slow to provide military equipment to the war-torn country. Christine Lambrecht, the defence minister, pledged about the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, in a speech to the representatives of 40 countries at high-level defence talks hosted by the US air force at its Europe headquarters in Ramstein, south-west Germany. In her speech, which was leaked to German media and reported widely on Tuesday morning, Lambrecht also announced a range of other measures, including participation in training Ukrainian soldiers in the use of the armoured Howitzer 2000, a long-range weapon, which the Netherlands has said it will deliver to Ukraine. In what is being referred to in German media as an “about-turn”, Germany is seeking to defend itself from harsh criticism from the US and Europe, especially from Ukraine’s government, that it has been far too hesitant to deliver heavy weapons, based, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said, on its fears of widening the conflict. On Friday, Scholz said he was wary of sparking world war three, and of provoking Russia into using nuclear weapons if Germany made the wrong choices. On Tuesday, the leader of the opposition conservative alliance, Friedrich Merz, accused Scholz of being “irresponsible”, arguing that not delivering the weapons would render Germany’s deterrence policies null and void, particularly in the Baltic region. In an interview at the weekend, Merz said: “Criticism abroad is growing and Germany is increasingly isolated”. In February, Scholz announced a €100bn (£84bn) package of measures to boost the German military in what he referred to as a Zeitenwende or new era in German foreign policy. However, a growing number of critics have accused him of failing to deliver on his promise and have argued that only when Germany plays a more active role in arming Ukraine will it be taken seriously and not viewed as being too timid towards Russia. Other aspects of Germany’s involvement in the conflict, such as the fact it has so far officially received just under 400,000 Ukrainian refugees over the past two months, according to German police, have not been widely acknowledged. The unofficial figure is thought to be considerably higher as the newcomers are not obliged to register immediately. At the meeting, Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, is expected to be joined by almost all his counterparts in the EU and the UK, as well as the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, and the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg. Beforehand, the US government made plain its expectation that European countries would provide more weaponry. Washington has already pledged $3.2bn-worth of equipment. The delivery of the Gepard systems has been under discussion for weeks in Germany. The Munich-based armoured vehicle manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) announced its readiness weeks ago to revamp the Gepards. They were previously in the possession of the German army for whom KMW designed them in the 1970s. They would, after a short period for overhaul, be ready to be delivered to Ukraine. The systems had been destined for Brazil and Qatar, where they were to be used as part of security measures for the Summer Olympics and the Football World Cup respectively, according to the magazine Spiegel. The government decision appears to have also been an attempt to pre-empt a motion expected to be put to the parliament this week, backed by the conservative opposition, together with the Greens and the pro-business FDP both of whom are in a three-way coalition with Scholz’s Social Democrats, (SPD), which would call on the government to finally deliver heavy weaponry, including both combat and armoured personnel carriers, as well as artillery, directly to Ukraine. On Friday, responding to criticism, he had been too hesitant and vague in his decision-making over Ukraine, including over plans to switch from supplies of Russian gas, Scholz said in an interview. He added he was not driven by fear, but by “political responsibility”, arguing he was “doing everything in order to avoid an escalation which could lead to a third world war”. The SPD’s federal chairwoman, Saskia Esken, had said on Monday there were no plans for Germany to deliver heavy weaponry to Ukraine, but that the government wanted to participate in a so-called Ringtausch, or multilateral exchange, instead. The three coalition partners have requested a parliamentary motion which would give the green light to Germany to provide heavy weapons via an exchange between countries, primarily involving eastern European states. The Gepards can be deployed on ground and air targets, including aeroplanes, helicopters, rockets and drones from a distance of 3.7 miles (6km). Meanwhile other manufacturers in the armaments industry have already applied for export permits for a variety of German-made heavy weapons systems in anticipation of an increase in the German government’s willingness to act which has been influenced by a nation’s deep angst over its murderous Nazi past. Rheinmetall, a Dusseldorf-based arms manufacturer, has applied to the German security council, under the chairmanship of Scholz, for the permission to export 100 decommissioned Marder Panzer, an infantry fighting vehicle which has been central to the mechanised infantry of the German army over the past five decades. These are expected to be renovated over the coming months, with the first ready for dispatch within the next two months. Training of soldiers to operate the armoured vehicles is also expected to take several weeks.  This article, including the headline, was amended on 26 April 2022.

4/27/2022,"Life for Child AU, the toddler at the centre of the UK’s latest child protection scandal, was almost unbearably bleak: she was unloved, isolated, underfed, understimulated, ignored and left shivering in her cot for hours wearing filthy nappies. “It can be surmised that Child AU learned that there was little if any point in crying,” the Northamptonshire safeguarding practice review noted grimly. “Health professionals noted that she presented as sad, watchful and frozen.” Her mother would refuse to pick her up, or cuddle her, and was witnessed asking the father not to talk to his daughter. There was no social interaction with other children. Her family’s pet dog had toys, the review said, but there was no sign of any for Child AU. When she was eventually taken into care, after hospital X-rays identified a broken arm and five previous fractures to her legs, the evidently traumatised girl would not smile or talk or cry. Her foster mother noted she had “learned to shed silent tears”. Much of this awful story was documented by health visitors, and later by social workers. A central question posed by the case is why these months of witnessed neglect never led to an escalation in protection for Child AU. Why was she allowed to stay at home? The review is clear on the shortcomings of the professionals involved: poor judgment; lack of professional curiosity when faced with hostile parents; lack of awareness of the risk of harm and the dangers of neglect. All this seems eminently justified criticism. The report is, however, strangely incurious itself about the wider context in which all this happened. Why did Child AU have four health visitors in 17 months? Why did three different social workers pass through her life in as many months? The health visitors told review investigators they did not press for child protection intervention because they assumed from past experience the request would be knocked back; the threshold for social care intervention, they implied, was set far too high. These snippets hint at structural and financial problems in the local children’s services but are not explored. Why such high staff turnover? What was behind the timid case management? Was decisionmaking around at-risk children possibly undermined by cost concerns or worries about unmanageable demand? Because the Child AU case happened in 2018-19 we know staffing, management and chronic finance issues did indeed form the broad backdrop. Northamptonshire Children’s Services (since replaced by a children’s trust) was, as Ofsted reported at the time, overspent, overwhelmed, and in utter chaos. The Child AU review is rightly rigorous in highlighting poor frontline practice. But it tiptoes around what other reviews have called the “bigger systems context” of cuts and council defunding. Of course, safeguarding professionals should learn lessons from these reports – but so should policymakers and politicians.",News/Society,Northamptonshire child neglect case: why was toddler allowed to stay at home?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/northamptonshire-child-neglect-case-why-was-toddler-allowed-to-stay-at-home
4/27/2022,"Boris Johnson has threatened to “privatise the arse” off the Passport Office if it cannot clear its backlog and deliver better value for money, a senior government source has told reporters. The prime minister also put the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and other “arm’s length” bodies on notice in comments to cabinet ministers, according to the source who attended Tuesday’s meeting. There had been an unprecedented surge in demand after the lifting of coronavirus restrictions because 5 million people had delayed renewing their passports during the pandemic. Under post-Brexit EU travel rules, UK citizens must have at least three months’ validity remaining, which threatens to put more strain on the system. It comes amid fears of summer of travel chaos with Brexit queues at Dover and concern about the routine cancellation of flights. Johnson is understood to be “horrified” at the backlog in dealing with passport applications and will summon the agency’s leadership for urgent talks at No 10 next week. He is said to be concerned that families wanting to go on summer holidays are under pressure to pay up to £100 extra per passport for fast-track applications because of delays. The source cautioned that privatisation would not be the starting point, but warned that Downing Street could look to businesses to take over if passport bosses could not meet the 10-week target for standard applications costing £75.50. Johnson was also said to have criticised “post-Covid mañana culture” at some of the bodies for not adapting after the easing of coronavirus restrictions. As well as the Passport Office, MPs have been raising concerns over significant delays in turning round applications for licences at the DVLA. Heathrow Airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it was “vital” that people could go on holiday this summer in case the UK reintroduced coronavirus travel restrictions. “Normally the Passport Office is very slick in processing passports. It’s really disappointing to hear [about delays]. “If it’s not resolved, it is going to mean that people can’t get away. “After two years of lockdown, we need to make sure people can have a good holiday because many of them have vouchers that they’ve been saving up, they’ve got trips of a lifetime that they’ve put on hold, and we don’t know when things might get closed down again. “Making the most of the summer is vital,” he said. On Monday, the Commons heard about one woman who had waited more than five months to receive her daughter’s new passport, and services were branded “either really very good or an absolute shambles”. The SNP home affairs spokesperson, Stuart McDonald, said: “All our constituents are having to cancel holidays, miss funerals, rearrange visits, with even a new 10-week target routinely being failed. “What will be done to avoid this predictable mess getting worse? And can we be assured that the 10-week target will not be lengthened further as we approach the summer?” Home office minister Kevin Foster said: “We don’t have any intention to further extend that standard. “We are at the moment processing most passports well within it, but we would advise people this is a very, virtually unprecedented surge in demand, and if people are planning to travel this summer we would advise them to get their application in as soon as possible.” He said the Passport Office dealt with a million applications last month, compared with 7m a year before the pandemic. Conservative MP Simon Hoare described the backlog as “unprecedented, true, but foreseeable, absolutely”. The PCS union, which represents Passport Office and DVLA staff, said there is a backlog of applications owing to lack of staff, poor management and failures with private contractors. HMPO planned to recruit 1,700 staff, with 450 in situ by the end of 2021. Only 300 were in place by the end of the year, and they were agency staff, the PCS union said. The union’s general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “It is clear to our members that a crucial service like the Passport Office needs to be properly resourced. It is absurd for Boris Johnson to threaten to privatise HMPO, when it is clear that the current problems are mainly down to increased casualisation of the workforce. “Many people are desperate to now start travelling again, and so I would call on the Home Office to fulfil their duties to the UK public and adequately fund the service, bringing the whole process back in house.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Privatising these services would force people to pay a premium for private profit, [adding to the cost of their passports and driving licenses]. That’s the last thing working people need in a cost of living crisis. Boris Johnson and his ministers are responsible for running these services. Instead of making bad policy on the hoof, he should call in his ministers to get to the bottom of why they are doing such a bad job.”",News/Politics,Johnson threatens to privatise Passport Office over backlog,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/boris-johnson-threatens-to-privatise-passport-office-dvla-applications-backlog
