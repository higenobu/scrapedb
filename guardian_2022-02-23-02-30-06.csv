2/23/2022,"While enthusiasm for lockdown pursuits such as baking and Peleton riding may be waning, a rise in bookings for Easter getaways confirms the country’s newfound passion for caravanning remains undimmed. The easing of travel restrictions means many Britons are planning foreign trips, but new figures from the Camping and Caravanning Club show holidays in the UK are in rude health, with bookings for its 100 sites up 33% on Easter 2019.  The four-day weekend usually heralds the start of the camping season but Covid rules either closed or limited Easter access to campsites in 2020 and 2021. This means it will be the first time in three years people are free to spend the break sleeping in their caravan or motorhome or under canvas. Simon McGrath, the Camping and Caravanning Club’s head of communications and external relations, said that with the exception of Wales (where campsites were open for Welsh residents last year), the curbs meant it had “missed out on the previous two Easters”. “Easter is a really popular time for camping that signals the start of the season,” he said. “This year looks certain to make up for lost time with strong bookings and a significant increase in the number of campers heading to our sites.” Popular destinations for its more than 700,000 members include – in what is the Queen’s platinum jubilee year – its Sandringham site in the grounds of the royal estate, as well as remote spots in Pembrokeshire in south-west Wales, and in the Scottish Highlands. The majority of its members are caravan or motorhome owners. The pandemic has made many Britons see domestic breaks, and caravanning in particular, in a new light. Last year dealerships struggled to get their hands on enough vans as a growing number of under-40s, including new pet owners, bought homes-on-wheels. Demand for other holiday vehicles, including motorhomes and converted vans, was also high. McGrath said the organisation enjoyed record membership levels in 2021 as new people took up the pastime or returned to it after a break. A big focus for its site teams this year would, he said, be “ensuring that all newcomers have a fantastic experience”. But after the hiatus caused by Covid the domestic holiday industry will once again be facing stiff competition from abroad this year with the leading tour operators reporting an increase in bookings for this summer, including a rise in long-haul trips to places such as the Caribbean. Tui says that its UK summer bookings are up nearly 20% on summer 2019 with demand for the period expected to be close to pre-pandemic levels. However, the worsening cost of living crisis is also a factor for Britons planning holidays this year. Inflation is at close to a 30-year high with economists predicting it will reach almost 8% in April when household energy bills are to soar by hundreds of pounds.",Lifestyle/Life and style,UK caravan site bookings rise for Easter as campers make up for lost time,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/22/uk-caravan-site-bookings-rise-for-easter-as-campers-make-up-for-lost-time
2/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s lengthy speech justifying the dismemberment of Ukraine said much about him but also contains chilling warnings for the rest of Europe. And European states must heed those warnings if they do not wish to be the next victims of the Russian president’s imperial ambition. It’s long been known that Putin hankers for a lost age of Russian dominance over its neighbours. Calling the collapse of the USSR the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century” is one of his most-quoted (and most misunderstood) historical judgments.  In his speech, Putin reached back far further than the cold war to find his grievances. He stated clearly that the processes that led to Russia losing territory a century ago must be reversed. He pointed out what he said were catastrophic mistakes by the Bolsheviks in recognising Ukraine as a republic, and ceding land to end the war with Germany in 1918. He lamented the loss not of the Soviet Union, but of the “territory of the former Russian empire”. The speech highlighted how unconstrained power, and perhaps the absence of anybody brave enough to disagree with him, has led Putin further into his own version of reality – and he has drawn Russia’s decision-making apparatus with him. The bizarre circus of his security council meeting broadcast earlier the same day, where Russia’s foreign intelligence chief seemed to freeze in fear while Putin openly mocked him, was a terrifying demonstration of how Moscow’s actions are driven by ideas and processes that have nothing in common with the west – and put it on an inevitable collision course with Europe. Putin’s warped description of the way countries achieved their independence from Russian rule is aimed at Ukraine, but there is little in it that could not also be applied to Poland, Finland and the Baltic states. Putin’s interpretation of history may be unrecognisable to the west, but it forms the framework for Russia’s current decisions and so cannot be ignored. This isn’t, of course, the first time Putin has said these things. But he has now removed all doubt that he is also intent on acting on them. There is also little doubt that the west has failed utterly in deterring Russia. Moscow’s newfound confidence has been clearly on display recently in instances such as the open blackmail of Europe over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, or testing its capability to destroy western satellites. It is barely going through the motions of justifying its latest act of aggression. A less self-assured Russia would make some attempt to make the pretext for military action convincing. This disregard for reputation, credibility and the reactions of the international community is another chilling indication that Russia will not be constrained by the norms and standards of behaviour that the rest of Europe takes for granted. All in all, there are few grounds to assume that Putin will stop at Ukraine. It’s easy to forget that Russia’s “draft treaties” from December demand rolling back western protection not only from the territories of the former Soviet Union, but all the countries of the former Warsaw Pact too. This does not mean Russia cannot be stopped. In countless studies analysing its ambition and how it planned to set about realising it, I and other Russia-watchers have pointed out that real and credible military force – and the demonstrated will to use it – is the western countermeasure that genuinely causes Russia to think twice and step back from aggression. That countermeasure was not offered to Ukraine, and now Russia is moving in. Threats that the west will help Ukrainian resistance in the event of occupation may ring hollow in Moscow, given Russia’s 100% success rate in suppressing resistance movements of this kind. Promising to extend Ukraine’s agony after it has been invaded is no substitute for real and tangible support to prevent it happening in the first place. And promises that Russia will face “another Chechnya” are particularly unhelpful if used unwisely. After all, in Chechnya, Russia won – and won so convincingly that the approach it eventually took was used as a template for operations in Syria. Russia prosecutes counterinsurgency campaigns and suppresses resistance with medieval viciousness because it knows this is effective. There is no reason to think the terrorising of civilian populations seen in Chechnya and Syria would not also be visited on the people of Ukraine. In his speech, Putin said that he had the names of supposed anti-Russian elements in Odessa, who would be found and punished. This was chillingly close to a recent US disclosure that Russia had drawn up a list of individuals in Ukraine to be rounded up or eliminated. This too is precisely in line with Moscow’s past practice in Poland, the Baltic states and all the other European territories it occupied in the last century. This also means western countries are right to urge their citizens to leave Ukraine, as tragic as it may be for those with deep roots there. By staying, they make themselves targets. It may be too late to save Ukraine. But it is not too late to bolster the next line of defence against Putin’s imperial ambitions. Other frontline states urgently need help from their western allies, partners and friends. This help should come not only in the form of closing specific military vulnerabilities and capability gaps, but also in the simple presence of allied forces – building on the successful example of Nato’s multinational battalions in the Baltic states and Poland. This means the UK too must urgently review its approach to defence. The move to partnering with and enabling other armies must not come at the expense of the long overdue reconstruction of the UK’s own land power. The sad fact is that whatever the UK’s vision of future conflict may be, the enemy also gets a vote – and a force that cannot be deployed, and is built on the assumption it will not suffer losses or attrition, presents no deterrent to Russia.

2/23/2022,"My grandmother, Audrey Pratt, who has died aged 100, was a talented illustrator and made a great contribution to the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force during the second world war. As a specially trained tracker of missing aircraft, her skills were called upon throughout the night of 6 June 1944, D-day, to plot the course of Royal Navy boats during the Normandy landings.  Audrey was born in Liverpool to James Upton-Prowse, an architect and keen watercolourist, and his wife, Phoebe (nee Mackrell). She was the eldest of three children. By 1927 the family had moved to Leeds, where Audrey attended Chapel Allerton girls’ school. Her love of art developed on holidays to Whitby, where she would join her father sketching on the cliffs. In 1938 she won a scholarship to Leeds Art College, but at the same time was offered a position at the local library, which she decided to take up. She fell in love with a fellow library assistant, Gordon Rogers, but he joined up in 1939 and the following year was killed during the evacuation of Dunkirk, aged 20. In 1942 Audrey received a visit from an army officer, Gordon Pratt, who had served alongside Rogers and had written to her at the time of his death. As it was Audrey’s half-day, they spent a few hours together. Audrey described much laughter on that afternoon, and although they did not meet again for almost four years, they wrote to each other often. By the time they were reunited in 1945, they had been engaged to be married for a year. In August 1942 Audrey began training at RAF Innsworth for the WAAF, and from there went to Leighton Buzzard as a special duties clerk. She developed a flair for “dead reckoning”, where she was able to interpret the whereabouts of aircraft using the controller’s instructions to the pilot together with the Craig computer, which made allowances for wind speed and direction. This plotting was vital for the radar stations if the planes they were monitoring disappeared due to interference. Because of her skills in this area, Audrey was transferred to the radar station at RAF Kingswear, where she worked through the night on D-day. In 1945, Audrey was sent to a base in Patrington, near Hull. There she won a competition to design and decorate the officer’s canteen and was then commissioned to paint other murals, including the bar of the officers’ mess at RAF Church Fenton, near Tadcaster. After the war, in 1946 Audrey and Gordon married and moved to Merseyside. They had three children. In 1966 Audrey began work for the Liverpool regional hospital board, as a research assistant on a patient survey. Her flair for visual art was again put to good use providing graphs and illustrations to analyse the data. Audrey and Gordon both retired in 1979 and began travelling abroad. In 1986 Gordon was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease; he died in 1991. Audrey constantly sought out new challenges, doing U3A courses, attending WAAF reunions, taking part in quizzes and volunteering at her local amateur dramatic society. She is survived by her three children, Stephen, Paula and Richard, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",News/World news,Audrey Pratt obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/audrey-pratt-obituary
2/23/2022,"Thank you for drawing attention to the ongoing neglect of the “other half” of 16- to 18-year-olds, those not on A-level courses in school sixth forms (Editorial, 20 February). I have been watching with dismay successive examples of this in my local area. Our young people used to be served by a tertiary college that offered both A-level and vocational courses. Then the local authority spent many millions from its reserves to create sixth forms in all the local secondary schools. All chose to be selective. When the authority scrutinised the effect of the changes in 2018, it only reported on how the sixth forms were doing. Nothing was said about the college. This was of course not under the control of the council, but neither were the schools, all academies by then.  In 2020, officers prepared a report for committee on “post-16 provision and outcomes”, but the only outcomes mentioned were A-levels. In 2021, financial problems at the college caused it to propose a merger with two others some distance away. Despite the potential significance of this for the “other half” of local 16- to 18-year-olds, officers responded to the required consultation without troubling the relevant committee. The creation of the sixth forms might or might not have been a good use of council money, but the consequences in terms of political attention paid to the “other half” have been profound.Geoffrey StantonLondon  Your editorial states that “the mixed-ability principle was never extended to higher education, which continues to be highly stratified”. The answer to any inequality-reducing strategy does not simply rely on creaming off students at 16-plus on the basis of academic achievement. You rightly point to the hugely significant role that could be played by local further education and tertiary colleges in improving access to both higher education and vocational education and training. The case for increased funding and support for colleges is a strong one. I continue to be surprised that little or no attention in this debate has been given to the truly comprehensive model of tertiary colleges. They provided a natural progression for the primary-secondary-tertiary model for comprehensive state education.Graham PhillipsHenley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire  The government’s notion of elite sixth forms is indeed a gimmick, but your editorial is mistaken in suggesting that in England there is a straightforward division between a hierarchical system of higher education and an egalitarian system of schooling. Leaving aside that most children of the rich and powerful do not attend state schools, the truth is that the state education system is nowhere near egalitarian. Not only does it continue to maintain a formal system of selective secondary schooling whose malign effects reach further than the number of such schools might suggest, but the doctrine of “parental choice” ensures that all schools exist in a market-driven hierarchy in which the least “desirable” children are concentrated in the least “desirable” schools and vice versa. The Augar review does not address the deeper need for all forms of post-16 education to have equal status. Our inability to shake off our obsession with hierarchy means we are stuck with an educational model designed for the 1930s, which does not augur well for our future.Michael PykeLichfield, Staffordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/23/2022,"There was excess demand for psychological support before Covid hit, and your article (Millions in England face ‘second pandemic’ of mental health issues, 21 February) highlights the impact the pandemic is having on the nation’s mental health. We need investment now to expand the mental health workforce in the NHS, schools, charities and voluntary services to support the millions who are experiencing mental health problems. It’s not simply a shortage of workers or delays in training them that’s preventing people accessing services, but a lack of political will and funds to bring existing skilled and experienced professionals into the workforce in greater numbers.  We represent 45,000 counsellors and psychotherapists who are ready to enter the workforce now to support the country’s mental health. We know that counselling can have a transformative effect, and the public know that too. Our public perceptions survey with YouGov found that 85% of people in the UK think that it’s a good idea to seek counselling or psychotherapy for a problem before it gets out of hand. Ultimately, early help is key and too few people are able to access services quickly. Investing in life-changing mental health services is critical to our recovery from the pandemic, and will deliver extensive cost-saving benefits to government budgets as well as tackling the deep-rooted inequalities that hold so many of our fellow citizens back.

2/23/2022,"We are sorry to cast doubt on the story of the U-boat captain who spared the Dunera and its cargo of internees from being sunk in July 1940 (Letters, 18 February), but it goes against the known facts. In the first place, the logbook of the U-56 was not “released in 1980”; along with numerous other U-boat logbooks, it has been held in the Naval Historical Branch of the Ministry of Defence since the second world war and was available to researchers such as ourselves during the 1970s. In his log, the U-56’s captain, Oberleutnant Harms, does describe firing two torpedoes at the Dunera, one missing, the other failing to explode. But he wrote nothing about sending out divers to retrieve jettisoned luggage or giving the Dunera safe passage. This fanciful story was related by Benzion Patkin in his book, The Dunera Internees (1979), who named the U-boat captain as one SC Clerque. Searches of the archives failed to find a U-boat captain of this name. We told all this in our own book about the wartime internment of refugees, Collar the Lot! (1980), which contains a full account of the Dunera’s voyage. We interviewed four of the deportees, two of whom had survived the sinking of the Arandora Star. Although internees’ luggage was looted, none said it had been thrown overboard, nor was this recorded in a statement compiled by the internees when they reached Australia.

2/23/2022,"After all the tough talk of the past month, the sanctions imposed on Russia by the west are unlikely to lose Vladimir Putin much sleep. The response to Boris Johnson’s announcement that five of the less important Russian banks and three individuals would be targeted was: is that it? The most dramatic news was Germany’s decision to halt approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to western Europe. That will have an impact, but may end up affecting Germany more than it does Russia.  The message from western capitals was that it was the plan all along to start small and then ratchet things up if Putin refuses to back down. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said there were several options to choose from. The west’s problem is that sanctions against Russia come at a cost, and that cost goes up as the regime is tightened. One suggestion, for example, has been to remove Russia from the Swift network, a messaging system linking banks that facilitates international trade. Such a move would certainly hurt the Russian economy because it would affect its ability to export its oil and gas. William Jackson of the Capital Economics consultancy notes Iran’s economy shrank by 7% when similar measures were imposed on Tehran. While Russia’s financial position is stronger than Iran’s, Jackson says the impact of tough sanctions might be to knock 4%-5% off Russia’s gross domestic product, push inflation above 10% and force the central bank to drive up interest rates to 14%. But cutting Russia out of Swift would hurt the west too. For a start, it would raise the obvious question of how to pay for Russian gas. What’s more, the global cost of energy would be certain to rise – perhaps sharply. So it looks likely that the west will adopt a step-by-step approach, leaving the toughest sanctions as a last resort. The most obvious way to ratchet things up a notch would be to extend the sanctions to a wider group of individuals in the hope that the oligarchs will put pressure on the Kremlin to back down if their assets are frozen. The three names announced by Johnson today were blacklisted by the US some years ago, which limits the impact of a UK designation. Targeting the Russian financial sector would be the next most obvious step. The UK could target the systemically important Russian banks – such as Sberbank and VTB – and could follow through on its threat to prevent Russia from selling its sovereign bonds on the London market. Calibrating the response is not going to be easy, in part because Putin might respond to sanctions by strengthening Russia’s ties with China and in part because the countries imposing the sanctions are already grappling with the highest inflation in decades. As Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, pointed out to the Guardian, the crisis in Ukraine is happening at a time when the world economy is only just emerging from the pandemic. “It adds to uncertainty when there is already plenty of it.”",News/World news,Ukraine crisis: sanctions against Russia come at a cost to the west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/ukraine-crisis-sanctions-against-russia-come-at-a-cost-to-the-west
2/23/2022,"On Monday evening, Stephen Colbert caught up on a weekend’s worth of potential third world war developments: Russia continues to amass troops on its border with Ukraine, and US intelligence reports point to a planned invasion of the country.  On Saturday, Russian separatists in the eastern region of the country started shelling Ukrainian army positions, which US officials warned “could be the prelude to direct Russian military action”. “Now, call me old-fashioned, but once you’re shelling, that’s pretty much direct military action,” the Late Show host said. “Hey, hey, slow down you two! I’m worried this getting completely naked and bumping junk might lead to direct sexual action.” Outside observers said the shelling came exclusively from the separatists, but the Russian separatists claim there was shelling from both sides. “It’s a real he-shelled, she-shelled by the seashore [situation],” Colbert quipped. Russia has continued to downplay the situation; ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov appeared on Face the Nation this weekend and said, “there is no invasion and there is no such plans…Russian troops are on sovereign Russian territory. We don’t threaten anyone.” “Yes, Russia’s not threatening anyone! That’s just how they show affection over there,” Colbert joked. “In Russia, if a boy surrounds your house with tanks, that is a prom-posal.” Vladimir Putin has already recognized the separatists as informal republics; in a recent speech, he declared the independence of Moscow-backed regions in eastern Ukraine and referred to them as “ancient Russian lands”. “So they’re independent, but they also belong to Russia,” said Colbert. “Putin’s just living the spirit of the old saying, ‘if you love something, let it go. If it doesn’t come back, surround it with 190,000 troops, then ask it again.’” On Late Night, Seth Meyers dug into the botched unveiling of Donald Trump’s new alternative to Twitter, an app called “Truth Social”. The app launched over the weekend, with issues: select users who tried to create Truth Social accounts were repeatedly met with a red error warning which said “something went wrong, please try again”. “Though by the time you find yourself signing up for a Donald Trump social media site, something already went wrong,” said Meyers. “But I’m guessing they’ll try again – if you were first in line to sign up for truth social, you’ve probably got some free time on your hands,” he added, mocking a Truth Social user: “Well, I’m just sitting here, waiting for JFK Jr to reappear at the Meadowlands with Elvis and the Loch Ness monster to prove the election was stolen – I guess I’ll try logging in again!” “I really enjoy how vague the error message is: ‘something went wrong,’” he continued. “Like, even they don’t know what the problem is? Usually you get an error code or something, but Trump’s site just gives you a shrug emoji that says ‘what were you expecting, this thing is a clusterfuck!’” The snafu makes sense, Meyers continued, because the site is run by former GOP congressman Devin Nunes, who told Fox News last week that the site would be “fully operational” by the end of March. “By the end of March? This is the digital age!” Meyers laughed. “Everything is measured in nano-seconds and you’re moving at the speed of civil car letters home.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon touched on an unfortunate headline from the Winter Olympics in Beijing: the Finnish cross country skier whose competition left him with a frozen penis. “He used it to his advantage though – for two of the turns, he didn’t even use a ski pole,” Fallon joked. “People could tell something was wrong when he was doing a handstand under the hand dryers in the men’s room.” “I feel for the guy, though,” he added. “He’s trained for years and now that’s what comes up when you Google him.” Fallon also discussed the crisis in Ukraine, where it appears all but certain that Russia will invade. “As we speak, Putin is flipping a coin like ‘heads I invade, tails I invade shirtless,’” Fallon said. “Putin’s about as undecided as when a server asks if you want a side salad or fries.”",Arts/Culture,"Stephen Colbert on Ukraine crisis: ‘Once you’re shelling, that’s pretty much direct military action’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/22/stephen-colbert-russia-ukraine-crisis
2/23/2022,"The director of the Whitworth Art Gallery is being asked to leave his post by the University of Manchester, after a row when a statement of solidarity with Palestine’s “liberation struggle” was removed from an exhibition of works by a human rights investigations agency. Alistair Hudson, who heads the Whitworth and Manchester Art Gallery, has been asked to leave by the university, the Guardian understands, after a series of complaints by UK Lawyers For Israel (UKLFI).  The university explicitly cited his response to the fallout from an exhibition that denounced Israel’s military operations in Gaza and its “ethnic cleansing” of Palestinians, sources say, a move that, in turn, was criticised as “stifling open debate and taming political art”. UKLFI, which advocates for Israeli causes, told the Guardian it had “suggested that the university should take appropriate disciplinary action” against Hudson in the months after the exhibition closed. The controversy dates from August, when a statement of solidarity with Palestine that formed part of an exhibition by Forensic Architecture, a Turner prize-nominated investigative agency, was removed after a complaint by UKLFI. The group suggested the university could have breached its public sector equality duties by not considering the “impact of the inflammatory language and representations” in the Whitworth’s “Cloud Studies” exhibition on Jewish people in Manchester. The exhibition explored how pollution, chemical attacks and the aftermath of explosions affect marginalised people in Syria, Beirut, Louisiana and Indonesia, as well as Palestine. Forensic Architecture, whose digital models of crime scenes have been cited as evidence at the international criminal court, then demanded the immediate closure of its exhibit. Its founder, Eyal Weizman, a British-Israeli professor at Goldsmiths, expressed concerns about academic and artistic freedoms and stated the importance that the equality duty included Palestinians. The university, which runs the gallery, reversed its decision, reopening the exhibition and agreeing to display “different perspectives on the issues raised by the exhibition and help contextualise them”. Commenting on Hudson’s departure, Weizman said: “Alastair turned the Whitworth into an art space where the important questions of our time could be asked. His sacking is the last in series of bullying actions by the University of Manchester, which initially aimed at silencing our solidarity with Palestinians, then at stifling open debate and taming political art more generally. This move will shrink the space for art and artists.” Jonathan Turner, chief executive of UKLFI, said the group had “pointed out to the university that the director of the Whitworth Art Gallery had falsely assured the vice-chancellor that they had established the accuracy and legalities of the work presented in the Forensic Architecture exhibition”. “We suggested that the university should take appropriate disciplinary action,” Turner added. The group said the exhibition included inaccuracies, and claimed a freedom of information request “showed no attempt had been made to check its accuracy”. Forensic Architecture strongly refutes the suggestion of any inaccuracies in the exhibition. The agency has presented evidence in international and national courts and truth commissions. Their Turner-nominated piece investigated the fatal shooting of a Bedouin Palestinian, Yaakub Abu al-Qiyan, by Israeli police officers in 2017, questioning the official narrative of events. The former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2020 apologised for the killing. At the time of the nomination, UKLFI wrote to the Turner prize judges and the Tate director, arguing that the work lacked objectivity. Hudson, who replaced Maria Balshaw when she was appointed director of Tate in 2017, joined from the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art in 2018. He is also co-director of the Asociación de Arte Útil, which promotes the idea of “useful art” alongside the Cuban artist and activist Tania Bruguera. The Whitworth is currently exhibiting a solo show by Suzanne Lacy, a California artist whose previous exhibition at Manchester Art Gallery instigated an increase in cleaners’ wages at the institution. When Hudson was appointed, the university spoke of his “wealth of experience at the forefront of the culture sector”. Prof James Thompson, the vice-president for social responsibility at the time, praised Hudson’s dedication “to the idea of cultural institutions as a force for promoting social change”, which, he said, “fits precisely with the mission of the Whitworth”. A University of Manchester spokesperson said: “We absolutely uphold academic freedom. Staffing matters are strictly internal to the university and we never comment on questions of this nature.”",Arts/Art and design,Whitworth gallery director Alistair Hudson forced out over Palestinian statement,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/22/whitworth-gallery-director-alistair-hudson-forced-out-over-palestinian-statement
2/23/2022,"For the vast majority of travelers, stepping foot on an airplane entails a tremendous act of near-blind faith. We control our own cars, trains operate on set tracks at ground level, but flying requires us to put total trust in the expertise of a complete stranger to operate a machine too complex for us to understand. Every time these gargantuan hunks of metal don’t plummet screaming from the sky towards a certain fiery doom, it feels like a miracle, even if that’s how the majority of flights play out. Rory Kennedy’s damning new documentary Downfall: The Case Against Boeing takes a close look at two incidents included within the small number of flights when things go wrong, and shows us the tragedy that strikes when that sacred compact between passenger and airline is violated.  “I fly a good deal, and the truth is I’ve got a bit of a fear of flying,” Kennedy tells the Guardian from behind the wheel of her car, talking transit in transit. “I like to think that when I walk down that jetway, the manufacturer of that plane is invested in keeping it up in the air, that the regulatory agencies focused on safety are doing in their job, and that at least in our country, the government is making sure the regulatory agencies enforce those safety measures. In this case, it seems that all of those agencies failed us.” The case she’s referring to is the horrifying account of two crashes related in their shared cause of a faulty part on the Boeing 737 Max model. On 29 October 2018, Indonesia’s Lion Air Flight 610 dove into the Java Sea and left behind 189 casualties; the following year, on 10 March, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 met a similar fate in a similar fashion, with a death toll of 157. After the first catastrophe, one might have expected Boeing to ground their Maxes until they could pinpoint the source of the malfunction. Instead, they shifted culpability to human error on the part of Lion Air, painted by the corporation’s spokespeople as an incompetent third-world operation. Americans certainly had nothing to worry about, they insisted, right up until the Ethiopian Airlines system failure further tarnished their reputation and got people asking whether the Max was really so rock-solid. Boeing halted use of the jets, by which point they were already far past too late. “I followed the story of the two Max crashes, the brand-new 737s that crashed within five months of each other,” Kennedy says. “As one of our characters explains, that just doesn’t happen in modern aviation. It drew a lot of attention, including mine. I was surprised, given how similar the flight patterns were, and how the planes were both the exact same model. There was no weather incident, which caught my eye, as did Boeing’s response. I expected them to be deeply apologetic, to ground the planes immediately and commit to figuring out what’s wrong with them. They took 346 lives. But instead, it seemed like Boeing was focused on blaming the pilots for what happened. I felt like there was a lot more to the story, and wanted to know what happened, with the intention to prevent something like this from happening again.” The trenchant film (now streaming on Netflix following a well-received debut through Sundance back in January) details her muckraking, which forms the picture of a business willing to gamble with lives for the sake of profit. We learn that Boeing executives knew full well about the risks inherent to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, a small wind gauge that can make the plane’s auto-stabilizers go haywire if damaged. Kennedy delves deep into the mechanical nitty-gritty at play, rendering intricate technical processes palatable for those of us lacking a background in advanced engineering. “I’m not an airplane pilot,” she says. “These terms and concepts were foreign to me, too. I wanted to make them accessible to somebody like me. We worked really hard to fully understand them, and then turn them into information that I hope is digestible to laypeople. At the same time, there’s also an element of determining how much audiences needed to know, because we could’ve gone deeper, but you don’t want to overload your viewer.” She sticks to the major bullet points of Boeing’s malfeasance, chief among them the company’s inkling of how wrong things could go. “The thing that was most shocking to me was the report that came out after the first crash, where the FAA and Boeing were aware that this aircraft had a likelihood of crashing 15 times over the course of its life, a catastrophe on average every two years,” Kennedy says. “They knew that and kept the planes in the air, banking on the hope that they’d create a fix before another plane crashed. Who makes that choice?!” Her rhetorical question has a non-rhetorical answer: Boeing knowingly set themselves up for an expensive, image-destroying scandal because they were already developing a fix for the MCAS, and had banked that nothing would happen before they could implement it. The staggering callousness and hubris behind this decision go hand in hand with greed, an imperative to keep profit margins sky-high at the cost of everything else. Kennedy’s film conveys that Boeing was once the gold standard of American industry, bringing international travel to the world and getting Nasa to the moon by upholding a rigorous degree of excellence on the factory floor. But the ascendance of competitor Airbus (which now holds a dominant market share) put the fear of god in Boeing’s shareholders and CEO, who issued the dual mandate of “cheaper” and “faster”. “It’s the profit-driven running of companies into the ground,” Kennedy says. “You can look at the energy industry, fossil fuels, the destruction of the environment, all for the sake of profit. You can see it in healthcare, media. Part of my interest in making this film was the hope that it could rise to something bigger. We need to be skeptical of all these industries. There were many decades when Boeing did extraordinary things by focusing on excellence and safety and ingenuity. Those three virtues were seen as the key to profit. It could work, and beautifully. And then they were taken over by a group that decided Wall Street was the end-all, be-all. There needs to be a balance in play, so you have to elect representatives that hold the companies responsible for the public interest, rather than just lining their own pocketbooks.” Kennedy and the air-safety activists passing through her film – investigative journalist Andy Pasztor, Congressman Peter DeFazio of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, grieving father Michael Stumo – request only that the regulators and manufacturers do their jobs. Likewise, the uppermost decision-makers need to recognize that maximizing quarter-to-quarter cashflow might look good on a stock report, but isn’t the key to longevity. Until then, we have no choice but to advocate for ourselves before depositing our helpless bodies in an aluminum canister on a wing and a prayer. “I researched airplane safety, and to get on a commercial airplane in most countries is such a safe form of travel,” she says. “I think it’s been 10 years where there have been no commercial airplane crashes, prior to the two, at least just in the United States. The thing to do is research what sort of plane you’ll be taking. I like JetBlue and Delta these days because they fly the A320. There are aircraft that I prefer to fly now. I’m not getting on a 737 Max based on the research I’ve done and the pilots I’ve spoken to, who have ongoing concerns about the safety of that plane.” Downfall: The Case Against Boeing is available on Netflix now",Arts/Film,‘All those agencies failed us’: inside the terrifying downfall of Boeing ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/22/downfall-the-case-against-boeing-netflix-documentary-737-max
2/23/2022,"The largest expanse of Roman mosaic found in London for more than half a century has been unearthed at a site believed to have been a venue for high-ranking officials to lounge in while being served food and drink. Dating from the late second century to the early third century, the mosaic’s flowers and geometric patterns were a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime find, said Antonietta Lerz, of the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola).  It was discovered about a month ago at a construction site near London Bridge. The mosaic, which is eight metres long, will be lifted later this year for preservation and conservation work, with the eventual hope of it being publicly displayed. Its main panel features large, colourful flowers surrounded by bands incorporating a twisted-rope design, set within a red tessellated floor. There are also geometric elements and lotus flowers in the main mosaic and a smaller nearby panel. David Neal, an expert in Roman mosaic, has attributed the design of the larger panel to a team of mosaicists known as the Acanthus group, who developed a unique style. The smaller panel is a close parallel to one unearthed in Trier, Germany, suggesting that London artisans travelled abroad. The archaeologists from Mola, who have worked at the site since last June, believe the room housing the mosaic was a triclinium, containing dining couches on which people would recline to eat and drink while admiring the decorative flooring. The walls were also richly decorated. The triclinium may have been part of a Roman mansio, effectively an upmarket motel offering accommodation, dining and stabling to state officials and couriers travelling to and from Londinium across the river. The footprint of the building is still being uncovered, but it appears to have been a large complex around a central courtyard. Another large Roman building was also found at the site, which archaeologists say was likely to have been the private residence of a wealthy individual or family. Traces of lavishly painted walls, terrazzo and mosaic floors, coins and jewellery have been found. Among the items recovered are a decorated bronze brooch, a bone hairpin and a sewing needle. “These finds are associated with high-status women who were following the latest fashions and the latest hairstyles,” said Lerz. It was “the heyday of Roman London”, she added. “The buildings on this site were of very high status. The people living here were living the good life.” The site is being redeveloped as The Liberty of Southwark, a complex of offices, homes and shops that is a joint-venture by U+I and Transport for London (TfL).",News/UK news,Lavish Roman mosaic is biggest found in London for 50 years,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/lavish-roman-mosaic-is-biggest-found-in-london-for-50-years
2/23/2022,"Australian voters are more inclined now than a year ago to believe the primary purpose of government is boosting the wellbeing of the population, and less inclined to worry about law and order, according to new research. Polling undertaken for the Centre for Policy Development records a five-point year-on-year rise in support for the idea that the primary purpose of government is to improve overall wellbeing and a seven-point drop in the number of respondents saying government should prioritise public safety and the rule of law.  When asked earlier in February what they thought was the primary purpose of government, 32% of respondents said improving wellbeing (up from 27% in 2021) and 11% (down from 18%) said maintaining safety and the rule of law. More survey participants in 2022 also nominated the delivery and funding of social services as a primary purpose of government (31% said this was important, up from 28% last year). The Centre for Policy Development has been researching voter attitudes to the role of government since 2017. The centre’s chief executive, Travers McLeod, said it had been clear for a long time that a majority of Australians supported the maintenance of public sector capability to deliver critical services. But he said the coronavirus pandemic prompted a noticeable community shift. “Since Covid has revealed the critical weaknesses in our service systems people have become even more forthright in their views, not just about the purpose of government, but about the need for government to maintain and deliver the social infrastructure at the heart of our nation,” McLeod said. The research comes ahead of a May federal election. Scott Morrison has declared it is time for governments to step back after a period of interventionism during the pandemic while the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, is campaigning on the idea that government is transformative for people. The poll of 1,069 respondents undertaken by Essential suggests 58% of respondents believe it’s very important that government delivers social services directly, compared with 53% in 2021 and 57% in 2020. Older voters are more likely to hold that view than younger cohorts, and there has been a significant increase in Victorian voters holding that view (57% this year compared to 48% last year). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Voters on higher incomes, younger voters and voters in full-time work were less likely to say government delivery of services was very important. The poll shows nine in 10 respondents felt it was either very or somewhat important for governments to maintain capacity to deliver services directly rather than outsourcing provision to third parties. McLeod said responses to this question since 2017 had consistently shown support above 75%, with a “sharp and sustained increase” to about 90% from 2020, which was the first wave of the pandemic. Labor voters were more inclined to agree with this proposition than Coalition voters, although super majorities apply in both cases – 90% of Liberal and National party voters thought maintaining capacity for direct service delivery was important, compared with 95% of Labor voters. Attitudes were more or less consistent between voters in the inner city, outer suburban and regional cohorts. Voters are also conscious of the role of state governments in service provision, consistent with their lived experience during the pandemic, with 43% of respondents saying their state government directly benefits them the most (compared to 47% last October), and 48% say the states are most responsible for delivering services to the community (50% last year). But the polling shows more people acknowledged direct benefits provided by the federal government. Last year, 31% of respondents said the federal government directly benefited them the most. In 2022, this was up to 37%. Travers said the research tracking a growing desire “for all governments to protect and preserve wellbeing, to deliver critical services and to strengthen social infrastructure shows a way forward for proponents of Australian democracy which can help Australia unify and flourish as we recover from the pandemic”. The trends, he said, suggested “Australians want government as an active participant in service delivery, either a direct service provider or a partner that knows what it takes to make services work most effectively at the local level”.",News/Australia news,"More Australian voters say government should prioritise population’s wellbeing over law and order, poll suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/more-australian-voters-say-government-should-prioritise-populations-wellbeing-over-law-and-order-poll-suggests
2/23/2022,"The New South Wales police have confirmed they are investigating a complaint of alleged intimidation of Liberal MP Fiona Martin after she was confronted by a pro-Russia anti-vaccine mandate activist. Simeon Boikov, who styles himself as an independent journalist known as the Aussie Cossack, arrived with a camera in tow at the MP’s pop-up campaign stall at Cabarita Park on Monday, later posting several videos of the incident to YouTube.  The videos depict Boikov attempting to question Martin as she gets into her car to leave the park, before a staffer for the marginal seat MP calls the NSW police. In the video, Boikov labels Martin a “coward”, a “rat [running] from a sinking ship”, saying she “ran like a criminal” away from him and suggesting it is a “crime” or “unAustralian” behaviour to waste police time. Katja Theodorakis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Guardian Australia that, while she didn’t suggest Boikov was an extremist, the “divisive” language used to “troll” Martin is consistent with language used by extremists seeking to create division in Australia and other liberal democracies. Boikov featured in a 2021 ABC Four Corners investigation as the leader of the Australian Cossacks, a group that promotes pro-Russian government sentiment. In 2018 Boikov reportedly told a Russian media outlet that “we have a unique opportunity to support Russia from within an enemy state”, in reference to Australia, although he later told the ABC he loves Australia and wants to improve Australian-Russian relations. Boikov was a prominent figure in the recent anti-vaccine mandate convoy to Canberra, part of a contingent of live-streamers and YouTube personalities who broadcast for hours from protests and demonstrations. Boikov was invited into United Australia Party MP Craig Kelly’s office during the recent parliamentary sitting fortnight, to accompany a “delegation” of protesters as a so-called “independent press” representative. Martin claims that on Monday Boikov and his associates twice blocked her car as she attempted to leave Cabarita Park. The video depicts one incident in which Martin waves Boikov away while he stands near her driver-side window and continues to attempt to ask her questions. Martin said the incident prevented her talking to other constituents, as Boikov encouraged protesters to attend the park. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I’ll talk to anybody if they’re reasonable and calm and not intrusive and offensive,” she said. “But this bloke was quite full-on. “And at a time when we need more bloody women in parliament, and ones with guts. “The [starter’s] gun [for the election] hasn’t even gone off.” In the video, Boikov repeatedly cites Martin’s campaign event invitation to “come and ask me a question” as justification for bringing a camera crew. The video depicts at least three police cars and six officers attending, including one who claims they have responded to a report of property allegedly being damaged. After police arrived, Boikov told them “for your safety it’s better we have the mic rolling”, clarifying that “for public safety” it would be better “to get the right story”. “What’s the damaged property?” Boikov asked the police. “Everything that happened today is on camera... there’s no damage to property, that’s a false allegation.” “This is what you call a politician using police to intimidate political opponents,” he said, prompting the policeman to reply “I don’t think you’re intimidated at all by us”. Boikov and his companions were not detained or charged by police. Asked about the incident number quoted by Boikov in the video description, the NSW police replied: “Police from Burwood Police Area Command have commenced an investigation following a complaint of alleged intimidation towards a 43-year-old woman at Cabarita Park about 9.15am on Monday 21 February 2021.” Although not endorsed by the United Australia Party, Kelly helped launch Boikov’s campaign for the NSW state seat of Strathfield in January. In a video posted by the Aussie Cossack account, Kelly addressed a demonstration three weeks before the byelection claiming the “fightback” would start with Boikov’s candidacy, urging supporters of all parties to back him. “Let’s send a rocket and send a message to [Scott] Morrison and [Anthony] Albanese that these forced mandates must end,” Kelly said. Boikov, who has more than 152,000 subscribers on YouTube, and 24,000 followers on Telegram, has launched a campaign website claiming he will seek election for Martin’s seat of Reid at the federal election. The endorsed UAP candidate for Reid, Jamal Daoud, said he was “against the party supporting or associating” with Boikov, and had received confirmation from party officials that “we are distancing ourselves now from him – totally”. “As [he is] an independent candidate, we are not involved with him.” Theodorakis said that Boikov’s participation in the Canberra convoy and other anti-vaccine mandate protests fits into “a wider trend of anti-government activism that’s quite populist in nature”, and “it’s very easy to jump on this cause and make yourself part of this ‘freedom’ agenda where you can dress yourself up as a defender of democracy”. “The language in that video he posted where he trolled Fiona [Martin] is quite concerning in terms of its divisive, incendiary potential – he employs the kinds of ‘enemy constructs’ that also underpin extremism … [although] I’m not saying he is an extremist. “It deliberately polarises, based on distinctions like ‘our freedom v their tyranny, our truth v their lies’. “It’s ‘the people’ and independent media – who he says he represents – versus the mainstream.

2/23/2022,"The United Australia party’s warning it will outspend its 2019 campaign in the looming election has prompted calls for urgent reforms to limit party expenditure. Integrity experts have claimed this would stop money distorting the electoral process.  The Centre for Public Integrity released a reform blueprint on Wednesday aimed at removing the influence of money in federal politics and fixing what it described as the “weakest donation laws in the country”. The paper recommended lowering the donation disclosure threshold to $1,000, implementing donations caps, and beefing up the Australian Electoral Commission, giving it a new dedicated enforcement division to better police donation laws. The UAP’s recent suggestion it will outspend its $80m election campaign in 2019 also prompted the Centre for Public Integrity to call for urgent expenditure caps. Even well before the campaign proper begins, the UAP’s social media spending alone is vast. A Guardian analysis of YouTube ads shows the party has spent an average of $472,625 each week for the past six weeks, totalling $2.83m on the platform alone in 2022. Its spend on ads across other mediums – including print, radio and digital – has been estimated at more than $31m since August. Expenditure caps exist at a state level in the Australian Capital Territory, where a spending limit of $42,750 is in place per candidate, and New South Wales, where spending is capped at $132,600 per electorate. Caps also exist in Queensland and South Australia, where spending is limited to $95,964 and $83,635 per seat respectively. The Centre for Public Integrity chair, Anthony Whealy, a former NSW supreme court judge, said the lack of spending caps was, in a sense, the “root of all evil” in electoral financing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Huge campaign spends forced parties to seek large donations from private hands, he said, giving donors greater influence over politics. “I think there is every reason to believe it does distort the outcome of an election and the sheer bulk of the funds is the main factor in that,” he said. “We would never accept someone buying an election. This doesn’t buy them directly, but it does buy them indirectly, and therefore it is a savage blow.” The UAP has traditionally sourced the majority of its donations directly from Palmer, rather than from external donors. In 2019-20, for example, all of its $5.9m donations came from Palmer’s Mineralogy Pty Ltd.

The report also warns that “millionaire donors” were becoming the dominant source of funding for parties. It said in the two decades between 1998-99 and 2020-21, 22.48% of Coalition fundraising and 21.83% of Labor fundraising came from donations of more than $1m. “The small number of people who have the financial capacity to make large donations have a disproportionate ability to gain political access and influence,” the report said. The report proposes donations caps of $5,000 per donor per party. The amount is based on state caps, which exist in NSW, Queensland and Victoria. The Centre for Public Integrity executive director, Han Aulby, said that, without reform, the commonwealth’s donations system would remain the weakest in the country. The commonwealth’s donation disclosure threshold is now $14,500, compared to about $1,000 for many of the states, and donations are only reported on publicly once a year, with no requirement for more regular transparency during election periods. “The public will have no idea who is funding our parties before the next federal election,” Aulby said. “We urgently need to lower the disclosure threshold to $1,000, and cap political donations and election spending.” The UAP was approached for comment.",News/Australia news,United Australia party’s $80m-plus war chest sparks call to limit election spending,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/united-australia-partys-80m-plus-war-chest-sparks-call-to-limit-election-spending
2/23/2022,"Sea ice around Antarctica has dropped to its lowest level in more than 40 years, according to preliminary data from satellites. Climate scientists say the record drop can’t yet be linked to global heating but urgent research is needed to work out why the region’s sea ice had broken a record last set only five years ago.  Data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) showed the Southern Ocean sea ice coverage had fallen below 2 million sq km for the first time since satellite measurement began more than 40 years ago. Dr Walt Meier, a senior research scientist with the NSIDC, said it coincided with strong winds over part of the Ross Sea that had pulled ice to the north, where it melted in warmer waters or was broken up by waves. This pushed the sea ice extent – the area of the ocean covered by at least 15% floating ice – to below the previous record low set in 2017. But scientists expressed caution about attributing the retreat to the increase in global temperatures linked to greenhouse gas emissions. Since satellites started measuring sea ice from 1979, the two poles have been behaving differently. Sea ice has been disappearing rapidly in the Arctic but satellites have been showing a slight rise in the Antarctic, contradicting expectations from some climate models. The southern cover reached a record high in 2014 before crashing to record lows twice in the past eight years. Meier said the changes in Antarctic sea ice were “still really a muddled signal at this stage”. “Whether this is the start of [a decline] it’s still too early to say, but it’s definitely worth watching” Meier said. Dr Will Hobbs, who studies Antarctic sea ice with the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership, said the latest record was significant. There had been an expectation that after the record low of 2017 the ice would recover, he said. “But now we have these two events in five years that are off the records,” he said. “You can’t say this is climate change, but we do now have to consider whether or not the system is starting to change.” Researchers first got a hint something unusual was happening last August, when the ice stopped growing and started showing signs of retreat about a month earlier than usual. Antarctic sea ice is challenging to study because of the huge changes that occur. About 15 million sq km of sea ice – an area double the size of Australia – grows and substantially melts each year. The ice can be influenced by the strength and direction of winds as well as heat in the atmosphere and ocean. Hobbs, based at the University of Tasmania, said the record drop was a “watch and act” for scientists and should prompt a clammer for more research. The sea ice was fundamental to ecosystems and may play a role in protecting the Antarctic ice sheet from the effects of ocean heat, he said. When the ice sheet melts it adds to global sea levels. Prof Julie Arblaster, a climate scientist and Antarctic researcher at Monash University, said a lot of work was being done to pin down what was happening to the continent’s floating ice and how it might change in the future as the planet warms. She said while most climate models suggested sea ice would drop around Antarctica in the future, there was still “low confidence” in the results. “But it’s a critical issue because the ice has a lot of impacts on the global climate and on the marine life down there,” she said.",News/World news,Antarctic sea ice falls to lowest level since measurements began in 1979,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/antarctic-sea-ice-falls-to-lowest-level-since-measurements-began-in-1979
2/23/2022,"We are only one round into Super Rugby Pacific and already it appears a wildcard and a dark horse may yet upset the status quo in the Australian section of the competition. For the past few years the race for supremacy has played out almost solely between the Brumbies and the Queensland Reds, with the NSW Waratahs, Western Force and Melbourne Rebels merely making up the numbers.  The Waratahs, however, have somewhat shaken up the status quo with their 40-10 win against the Fijian Drua in Parramatta last Friday night, raising hopes the men in sky blue have turned the corner under new coach Darren Coleman. What exactly that five-tries-to-one performance means for the rest of the season is near-impossible to predict. It was a good start against underperforming opposition; to read much more into it would be foolish. Fortunately, Coleman has put the win into perspective and there seems little danger of the Waratahs repeating the familiar mistake of getting carried away. Regardless, it was heartening to see a playing group belting out their team song in the dressing room for the first time in 538 days, a rendition which showed just how much it meant. At the very least, there was evidence of genuine cultural change at the Waratahs, which will provide a solid foundation on which to build. Three days later, the Waratahs received another boost when it was officially announced Wallabies star Kurtley Beale was returning to Australia – and to NSW – although he will not be available for the Waratahs until next year. Meanwhile, Queensland coach Brad Thorn was, like Coleman, realistic about the Reds’ 23-5 win against the Rebels in Brisbane on Saturday. Acutely aware of the high standards in New Zealand, Thorn seemed at pains to try to say something positive about his side’s display but was brutally honest in his assessment that it was not satisfactory – a good sign if Queensland wants to continue to improve. There was plenty of room for improvement in the Reds’ game, starting with their lineout, but it was the first game of the season, played in atrocious conditions. Thorn did find something positive to say about gangling Reds fullback Jock Campbell whom he compared to former Brisbane Bronco Darren Lockyer and ex-All Black Ben Smith. High praise indeed, but well-deserving nonetheless. The Rebels would be disappointed not just with the result, which seemed to have an inevitability about it, but also their inability to stay in the contest. Under new coach Kevin Foote, they have appeared to go to great lengths to distance themselves from their more conservative approach of previous seasons. In recent years the Rebels attempted to accumulate points by kicking penalty goals, but on Saturday turned down several first-half opportunities t to go for seven points instead. With heavy rain forecast to bucket down the second half they knew they had to score points in the first. Down 13-5 at half-time it was difficult to play catch-up in wet conditions. In the absence of star winger Marika Koroibete, who is playing in Japan, the Rebels may struggle to make the necessary improvements to take their game forward this year. In their favour, it is early days. While the Reds’ win was fairly predictable, the Brumbies staved off a massive upset against the Western Force in Canberra. With Wallabies second-rower Izack Rodda leading the charge, the Force forwards took it up to the much-vaunted Brumbies tight-five until the ACT men re-grouped. The Force led with two minutes to go but the Brumbies showed their championship qualities at the end with Tom Wright putting Lachie Lonergan over to rescue the match 29-23. One could argue the Force did not know how to win, especially when they kicked the ball back to the Brumbies to give the ACT side one last chance to salvage the match. But it is tough to win in Canberra, particularly for another Australian side. The Brumbies did look somewhat lethargic at times, but for the Force to come so close to causing a boilover will give them confidence they can do something in this competition. Super Rugby in Australia desperately needs the Waratahs, Force and Rebels to step up to challenge the Brumbies and Reds to make the competition more engaging and marketable. While the Crusaders have been the most dominant team in New Zealand historically, the Chiefs, Highlanders and Hurricanes have all won the title in the last decade. Supporters of all five Australian teams must go into each and every season believing this could be their year, at least in the local derbies. Hopefully, the opening-round performances of the Waratahs and the Force were a true sign that Australian Super Rugby will not be a two-team competition for much longer. A clearer picture will emerge when the Waratahs host the Old Foe Queensland at Leichhardt Oval on Friday night, while the Force get another chance to prove they have progressed when they meet the Rebels in Melbourne on Saturday night. The more the Waratahs, Force and Rebels upset the apple cart the better it will be for Super Rugby in Australia.",Sport/Sport,"Could Waratahs, Western Force upset Australian Super Rugby apple cart?",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/could-waratahs-western-force-upset-australian-super-rugby-apple-cart
2/23/2022,"“My life has just been a little bit crazy lately,” Maggie Beer laughs softly as we get on the phone. That feels like something of an understatement. As well as her year-round duties helming a range of gourmet foods plus a shop and restaurant in the Barossa Valley, Australia’s most endearing celebrity cook is in a particularly busy period. Beer is back in the judging seat for another season of reality competition The Great Australian Bake Off. She’s also gearing up for this year’s Tasting Australia festival, which returns to South Australia in April to showcase the state’s best food and drink. Among other duties, Beer will be headlining the festival’s Town Square Kitchen Legends Dinner on 29 April.  On a more personal note, Beer and her husband, Colin, have also launched the Saskia Beer Churchill Fellowship, an initiative that will provide a passionate food lover with the opportunity to pursue sustainable, community-focused approaches to food production through travel and study. The fellowship honours the memory of Beer’s daughter, Saskia, who died in early 2020. Last year Beer hung a painting that reminds her of Saskia in the kitchen, the heart of their family home. She tells us why that painting reminds her of the happy times, as well as the story of some other important personal belongings. We have a painting by Davida Allen of a farmer, a young girl and some chooks. It is so important as, to me, it tells such a story of Saskia working with Colin and the birds when she was seven or eight years old. I’m the most sentimental so-and-so and I’m a hoarder of all sorts of emotional things. The painting is full of colour and exuberance and makes it feel like Saskia is there with us. And it’s hanging in my happiest place, the kitchen. Every family celebration we ever had was always there. Everything starts in the kitchen. The memories this painting evokes makes me smile and is a reminder of our family times together – the chaos that always surrounded us, with my girls bossing me around and competing as to who could make the best mayonnaise or who should be doing what. It’s like having our Saskia in the kitchen always. Now, this is hard. I have so many “useful” old-fashioned tools in my kitchen I could write about, yet on reflection I’ve decided that the most useful object has to be in the plural – archive boxes! I have a large office at the bottom of the garden full of so many boxes. Inside these boxes are piles of spiral notebooks of every shape and size in which I have recorded all the great food experiences that I’ve had over 40 years, both here in Australia and abroad. They’re records of every great meal that we’ve ever had. This is my gold. One day, if I ever take time to write a memoir, even if it’s just for the family, I’ll need these notebooks. They are my memories of dishes, of people, of restaurants, of different cultures. Just opening them up, either randomly or chronologically, I learn from them again and they continually inspire me to use an ingredient or an idea I’d forgotten about. Sometimes just glancing at the notes of a dish at a certain time and place brings back memories of far more than the food. It’s a history that I really want to take the time to transcribe – and, just perhaps, eventually create a memoir with. I’m very haphazard and frenetic. I always have thousands and thousands of emails that I don’t put into folders because I just never have time. But at least in today’s world with computers and the wonderful cloud I can always retrieve things I’ve mislaid. However it wasn’t always so when I used to write columns, menus and stories on typewriters with carbon paper copies and put them away … somewhere. One of my great regrets is losing my file from 1995. That year I was part of an amazing happening with the Barossa music festival, as their “official festival food designer”. I oversaw all the food served at each musical performance all over the Barossa. With the help of a great friend, Clare Bogan, we put so many hours into making each venue the perfect combination of music and local food. Now all that work – all of the excitement, the ideas that we put together and the record of that extraordinary time – is missing. One night the festival was staging a baroque opera in the Octavia Cellar in Yalumba, so it required a menu of 17th-century food for 120 people. I had such fun researching and cooking the banquet, the star of which was my hare pies with lard pastry. But on the night, the pastry collapsed! I was mortified. Even though there was still plenty of great eating I felt I wanted to explain to the assembled throng what had happened. I told the story of the chef who suicided in France at the court of Louis XIV when the fish didn’t arrive, saying I felt pretty bad about it, but not as desperate as that. The files that I’ve lost had the records of all the meals I’d planned over those 16 days. Of them all, I most regret losing the detail and photographs of this night as it was one of the most special nights of my food life. There’s so much about it I remember being amazing, I just need to fill in the gaps with my file, but it’s totally gone.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Maggie Beer: ‘It was one of the most special nights of my food life’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/23/three-things-with-maggie-beer-it-was-one-of-the-most-special-nights-of-my-food-life
2/23/2022,"Michael* has called Australia home for nearly a decade. He has a partner and a child here, friends and a community, a career he wants to pursue. But he has consistently faced a perverse choice: tolerate exploitation for job security, or risk losing his protections and right to stay. “My first employer used to bully me, all the time. I was forced to work long hours for no overtime, sometimes more than 60 hours without any more pay,” he tells Guardian Australia. “At first I accepted to work like that, because I cannot do anything: I am relying on the visa.”  “I have a son who is three-and-a-half years old. I sacrifice everything to give him a better life in Australia. I never give up hope because of my son’s future. But the government’s policies have taken all my efforts.” The government’s proposed migration amendment (protecting migrant workers) bill has been promoted as addressing migrant worker exploitation by establishing new criminal offences for “coercing … migrant workers to accept exploitative work arrangements”. It would also introduce broader ministerial powers to ban companies that break the law from sponsoring migrant workers. But critics argue the bill is fundamentally flawed because it carries no whistleblower protections for workers who expose their own exploitation. A Senate inquiry will hear evidence on the bill Wednesday morning. Michael arrived in Australia from a south-east Asian country in 2013. Guardian Australia is choosing not to publish his real name nor his home country out of fear it could jeopardise his visa and right to remain in Australia. He arrived in Australia to study cookery and after graduating took up a job as a chef on a 457 visa. But he says because his visa was tied to his employer he was vulnerable to exploitation. His second employer made him work “11-12 hours a day for six days a week, but only paid for 38 hours”. A third employer was bought out and restructured, leaving him again looking for a new job. Michael said each time he moved to a new employer he had to “start again” on his progression towards applying for permanent residency. “We live with uncertainty all the time,” he says. “We work hard, we do everything right, but we keep getting punished.” Michael’s fourth employer was a large hospitality company running several venues. He felt the security of a large firm would militate against the kind of exploitation he’d known in Australia. But he was shocked to learn, shortly after starting, that the company was being investigated for systemic underpayment of migrant workers. Workers were invited to present evidence of their own exploitation, “but nobody did, because we could lose our visa, we might be deported”. When the company later lost its rights to sponsor migrant workers as a result of adverse findings against it, Michael, and all of his colleagues on visas, were once more forced to start again. “To look for an appropriate sponsor is not easy. I am so scared and depressed the same problems will happen again.” Michael says the precariousness of his situation, and that of thousands of others of migrant workers, impacts not only the workers but their partners and families. He said there is a disincentive for migrant workers to report an employer that is exploiting them. As their visa is tied to that employment, they suffer if the employer is found to have acted improperly: their visa is cancelled. This forces them to find another employer, often on a timeframe as short as 60 days, and can imperil their right to stay in the country. Matt Kunkel, the chief executive of the Migrant Workers Centre, told the Guardian the bill would “make a real problem even worse”. He said wage theft and other workplace exploitations were “incredibly common” for those in Australia on temporary visas: more than two-thirds of migrant workers surveyed by the Migrant Workers Centre reported being paid less than the minimum standards, and a quarter reported other forms of workplace exploitation like forced or unpaid overtime. Kunkel said it was essential temporary visas workers could report abuse without any fear of an adverse outcome. “Our current migration system has created opportunities for unscrupulous bosses to take advantage of the precarious residency status of migrants,” Kunkel said. “If they report abuse or lose their job, they may also lose their ability to stay in the country. This means many are forced to make a difficult choice between reporting wage theft or maintaining their employment relationship.” Kunkel said many of the “so-called temporary migrants” have spent several years or even beyond a decade in Australia, “and are important members of our community”. A Senate inquiry into the government’s proposed bill previously heard consistent evidence the legislation lacked protections for migrant workers who were already suffering exploitation. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the bill “seriously underestimates the scale of the problem” and that wage theft and other exploitations of migrant workers are “endemic and widespread”. It said the proposed law, currently before the House of Representatives, was “fundamentally flawed” and failed to address the systemic factors that led to migrant worker exploitation. “It relies on vulnerable migrant workers coming forward to report exploitation and cooperate in an investigation, without providing them with any incentive or protection to do so. This could expose migrant workers to adverse immigration consequences, including the cancellation of their visa”. The Migrant Justice Institute’s submission cited a 2019 survey of over 5000 international students that found 38% did not seek help for a problem at work because they did not want “problems that might affect my visa”. When introducing the bill to parliament, the immigration minister Alex Hawke said it “will help to level the playing field” for migrant workers. The proposed new offences for companies – against coercing migrant workers to accept exploitative arrangements – were recommendations of the 2019 migrant workers’ taskforce report. Hawke said they were “designed to penalise the misuse of our migration program, and migrant workers, and create a safer environment for temporary migrant workers looking for employment”. Michael said his experience has undermined his faith in Australia, and his chance of a future here. “We always think Australia is a wonderful country, but what is happening to us makes us so disappointed, so depressed, so stressed all the time. “We worry all the time – maybe we made a mistake.” Michael’s name has been changed to protect his identity",News/Australia news,"Suffer in silence, or risk speaking up?

2/23/2022,"AGL Energy says a premium of at least 30% on its share price will be needed for an extraordinary takeover bid by the tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian investment firm Brookfield to potentially succeed. Markus Brokhof, AGL’s chief operating officer, has also dismissed Cannon-Brookes’ proposal to shut the company’s coal-fired power plants by 2030, saying that was unrealistic.  Responding to the consortium’s offer of a 4.7% premium on the Friday share price, Brokhof said any investment banker would advise a full company takeover required the suitors “to offer a premium of 30-40%”. He said AGL would additionally need guarantees about job security for staff and support for communities affected by coal plant closures. The comments suggest AGL could be open to selling to the consortium which on Saturday made an offer that valued the company, including debt, at nearly $8bn. Brookfield’s Asia-Pacific regional head, Stewart Upson, said he believed the initial bid – under which the consortium would also spend up to $20bn on new renewable energy and other infrastructure to replace the coal-fired power plants – was unprecedented. “I don’t think this has happened anywhere in the world ever before, by us or anyone else – buying a business like AGL with this much thermal [coal] generation with a plan over years, a decade-plus, to retire that and turn it into new generation,” he told Guardian Australia. “Australians should be excited by it and proud of it because this is going to make a major change in Australia’s emissions profile in a very responsible and managed way.” Upson said the proposed deal would draw on Brookfield’s $15bn global transition fund, set up to invest in and transform companies with high emissions. He said the consortium was not in a rush and had made no decisions since the offer was formally rejected on Monday. It argues the offer is an effective 18% premium on the average share price over a three-month period. “Obviously we feel like we put a very compelling offer on the table,” Upson said. “We think the value should be compelling to shareholders relative to the alternative they have in front of them, which is the demerger, where we feel value is probably only going to go down. We’re looking forward to hearing feedback from other shareholders and seeing what people think and then we can assess next steps.” The consortium bid was lodged in part to prevent a demerger planned to take effect from 30 June, under which AGL would be split in two, creating a new entity Accel Energy that would include the coal-fired power station assets. The suitors vowed to make AGL a net zero polluter by 2035. In response, AGL defended its own plans to reduced emissions as striking a balance between meeting current and future energy needs while “responsibly” decarbonising. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Brokhof said AGL had yet to receive a response from the bid consortium but a higher bid would be the “natural” next step. “If you would like to get the board’s attention, for sure you need to engage once more, or two times more, or whatever,” he told Guardian Australia. He said AGL did not believe its coal power plants – including Bayswater in New South Wales and Loy Yang in Victoria – could be closed by 2030. The company proposes to shut the plants no later than 2033 and 2045, respectively. Brokhof said the company had already invested $4.8bn in renewable energy in recent years and “money was not the problem”. “We know exactly how to find projects, to develop projects, to get all the permits and approvals and then take your financial investment decision, and then go into the construction,” he said. “And then building also the transmission line will take a lot of time.” The bid is being closely watched in Canberra. While Liberal moderates have welcomed the proposal, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appeared lukewarm, arguing the government wanted to see coal generators run for the duration of their scheduled operating life. Given the initial pushback by AGL, the government does not expect to be making regulatory decisions this side of the federal election.

The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, revealed on Tuesday that Cannon-Brookes had spoken to him about the proposal over the weekend. Albanese said the government seemed to be often out of the loop when it came to significant developments in the energy market, citing the energy minister, Angus Taylor, not learning about Origin Energy bringing forward the closure of the Eraring coal-fired power plant until the night before the announcement. “This federal government is so out of touch and so isolated that the NSW Perrottet Liberal government had known about this for six months and they didn’t bother to pick up the phone to Angus Taylor or Scott Morrison,” Albanese said. He said Australia needed “reliable, secure power, and we need it to be the cheapest possible” and that there needed to be “appropriate plans that look after people”. Investors in the transition needed certainty about the rules and regulatory structures for the energy market, Albanese said. Emma Herd, a climate change and sustainability partner for EY, said investors globally were hunting for opportunities to profit by accelerating the pace at which fossil fuels exited the market. She said it was consistent with Morrison’s appeal to rely on “can-do capitalism”. “Capitalism will do and is doing,” Herd said. “It’s just a question of whether we get it done fast enough when it comes from a climate perspective.” AGL’s share price eased by 0.8% on Tuesday to $7.85 after rising more than 10% on Monday.",News/Business,AGL open to higher takeover bid but says Cannon-Brookes plan to close coal by 2030 is unrealistic,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/agl-open-to-higher-takeover-bid-but-says-cannon-brookes-plan-to-close-coal-by-2030-is-unrealistic
2/23/2022,"When Penelope Spheeris was making the first part of her landmark documentary The Decline of Western Civilization in 1979 and 1980, none of the people she was chronicling were known outside of Los Angeles’s dank punk scene. They played furious music in clubs that looked and smelled like bathrooms, and lived in squats that looked and smelled like squats. (Or, like bathrooms.) But The Decline of Western Civilization is the first and best film of what would become a loosely linked trilogy exploring different LA subcultures over three decades.  Featuring rough-ready footage shot at gigs and candid interviews with future punk icons, this film is a slim time capsule of a nascent music scene not yet exploited through commerce or destroyed by day jobs. Spheeris enters a world filled with runaways, drug addicts and squatters, where audience members spit on bands to signal some form of vile, violent appreciation, where Nazi regalia is worn and confused as a symbol of anarchy. One memorable moment sees a young girl flippantly telling a story about a house painter who died in her backyard; before they called the cops, she and her friends posed for photos with the corpse.We meet Pat Smear, some 15 years before he joined Nirvana as their second guitarist. We visit Black Flag at home, still a few months off meeting Henry Rollins; the band’s singer is sleeping in an overhead closet fit to store spare blankets. A young Exene Cervenka is charming and excitable, on the cusp of ascending with future LA punk legends X, and aware of the importance of what she is trying to achieve. Everyone seems tragic and hopeful. The Germs’ charismatic young frontman, Darby Crash, is the film’s most magnetic force – and the most tragic too, the type of sympathetic character you want to both slap and hug. Crash was the victim of a chaotic family situation which spat him into the caverns of LA: translucent, addicted to drugs and riddled with insecurities about his sexuality, looks and abilities. At gigs, he gets so high that he forgets to sing into the microphone. He is scared of the violence that comes with his band’s shows, even though he is the drunken instigator of most of it. In the film, Crash cooks eggs in a rundown kitchen and candidly explains how he needs to be bombed before performing, how he started hurting himself on stage due to boredom. A few months after these interviews, he scribbled a one-line note and killed himself with an intentional heroin overdose. It was too late to change the movie poster: a shot of Crash lying with his eyes closed, almost lifeless, on a stage floor.The second and third films in this series are great too, but for different, lesser reasons. Part II: The Metal Years skews closer to a Spinal Tap experience, capturing what has since become known as “hair metal” or “cock rock”: tight leather, teased mullets, fingerless gloves, Jack Daniels chased with cocaine. Hair metal was rife in the late 1980s on LA’s Sunset Strip, and Spheeris was there to capture it all. This film came in 1988, seven years after the first, and by then Spheeris could attract the already famous – including Ozzy Osbourne, Steven Tyler, Alice Cooper, Kiss and Lemmy – to give lengthy interviews. Thankfully, she was savvy enough to balance these with the “almost famous”, like Randy O, frontman of a band whose major exposure would begin and end with this film. While being interviewed, O was convinced he would be a millionaire and his band “bigger than Zeppelin”. This film teeters between musicians who enjoy ridiculous wealth and success, and others who assume they will too, any day now. Each comes off as tragic and hilarious as the other.The third installation came in 1998, with neither a subtitle or any easy laughs. Spheeris intended to catalogue the same type of LA punk scene she encountered in 1979, but found the kids were no longer alright. She discovered clusters of teenage runaways, dubbed “gutter punks” – partly due to an anti-establishment stance and a shared aesthetic, but mainly because they often lived in the street. The resultant film was so bleak it was passed over for general release in the late 1990s. Rewatching it now, it’s not hard to see why this was a hard sell in the popcorn era of American Pie. But you’d be remiss to skip over this final, necessary document; as with Spheeris’ first two films, you’ll find tragedy and hope in even doses.",Arts/Film,The Decline of Western Civilization: one of the great music documentaries,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/the-decline-of-western-civilization-one-of-the-great-music-documentaries
2/23/2022,"On the morning of my daughter’s birthday, I am seeing patients. Today, they happen to be all women and, as the day unfolds, I realise that it is an unplanned window into the mother-daughter relationship. My first patient, at 90, is gleeful that she feels nowhere as bad as her scans dictate. A dancer, she insists on exercise as being the secret of her longevity. That, and her tight relationship with her daughter who is her “walking and talking partner”. When she tells me that this daughter increases her enjoyment of an already contented life, I melt.  My elderly Italian patient apologises for her English before relieving all my concerns with one sentence: “My two daughters – one for the medicine, one for the paperwork.” The next patient is a young professional confronting a new cancer diagnosis. My throat catches when she says “I miss my mum” because my eyes have just fallen on the part of the history that says her mother died at the same age of the same diagnosis. To sidestep this potent sentiment would be unacceptable, so I let her reminisce. Another young patient is grateful for her “rock star” mother who cared for the grandchildren. Her mother was a beloved school principal who didn’t think twice about an early retirement if it meant relieving her daughter’s stress. The mother tells me that her daughter’s prolonged good health is the only return she seeks. In a break between patients, I write a letter to Immigration. A young woman is nearing the end of life and would like to see her mother who lives abroad. This is the reassurance she needs that her son will be OK, and I suspect she is hanging on as a result. The mother is similarly desperate, and we all acknowledge that the pandemic has intensified the obstacles to travel. Still, it is worth a try, and I use every synonym for urgent to reunite daughter and mother. Primed with a morning of touching relationships and no doubt subconsciously reflecting on my own, the next encounter shocks me. I suggest to an elderly patient that, as her health deteriorates, I would like to keep her daughter abreast of developments. The usually genial woman stiffens and her eyes spit fire at me. “My daughter doesn’t exist!” My first instinct is to take this literally. “I am sorry, she is still listed as your contact.” “She might as well be dead to me.” I can’t help but wonder what caused a 50-year relationship to break down so irretrievably. As if to rub it in that mother-daughter relationships are not all they are cracked up to be, the next patient, apropos of nothing, releases a string of invective against her mother, accusing her of being a “toxin” and attributing her cancer diagnosis to the stress of their interactions. Our consultation freezes amid this unexpected outburst but, as I relay the good news about her prognosis, she calms down. “I bet your daughter is nice,” she says self-consciously. When my daughter was born, I joked that now there was someone to take me to my appointments in old age. I let her down early when I failed to suspect a serious milk allergy which led to a fussy baby who grew into an irritable toddler. Before I knew it, sandwiched between two carefree brothers, I had a perpetually annoyed little girl of whom few smiling photos exist. As much as I loved her, I appreciated her hours in childcare, which launched me into pools of maternal guilt. But those years passed, thanks in no small part to two supportive grandmothers. And now, before my very eyes, that squally baby is a teenager, and my patient is asking if she is nice. Well, the teenage catastrophes are real. The “massive” pimple that no one else can see. The sheer unfairness of having to make the salad again this week. The wry neck that could be easily avoided with less screen time. All unrivalled by the tragedy of the uncharged phone on the way to school. With a deep breath and a grain of salt, we get by! I think how my own teenage years spent in the pre-internet era were a world apart. They were studious and sheltered. Having attended public schools on different continents, I cannot remember a classmate who had a learning difficulty, physical disability, or mental illness. Of course, those children were among us but were rendered invisible. Now I wonder what happened to the children who failed to thrive and how I might have helped. Today, I watch my daughter employ the full extent of her empathy and humanity in a way I didn’t. When I recently berated her for watching dog videos late at night, she was actually helping a friend in crisis. Sometimes, I worry that she assumes challenges she is not fully equipped to handle but it is a joy to watch her grow in the process. The teacher says she has many bright students, but the real joy comes from the reliably helpful ones. Thankfully, her loud baby lungs have made way for an articulate voice that defends principles. When the school librarian told her to put down a prize-winning fiction book “meant for older readers”, she shrugged and picked up my copy instead. Intuitive love is a wonderful thing. On a long day, she will pluck me a flower from the garden and have a heated meal waiting. Bursting to ask me about a party invitation, she will first inquire about my day. I talk to my mother every day and assume she knows I cherish her. But lately, I realise that of all my daughter’s gestures, the one that makes my heart brim is when, without expectation or invitation, she tells me that I am a good mother. This reward transcends all achievements and all incentives. Watching the steadfast mother-daughter relationships of my patients through health and sickness gives me hope for mine. Meanwhile, my patient expects a reply, so I think of something diplomatic that is not saccharine. “We all have our moments, but yes, my daughter is alright.”",Opinion/Opinion,Watching mother-daughter relationships through health and sickness gives me hope for mine | Ranjana Srivastava,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/22/watching-mother-daughter-relationships-through-health-and-sickness-gives-me-hope-for-mine
