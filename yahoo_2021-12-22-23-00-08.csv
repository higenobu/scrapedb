12/22/2021,"MOSCOW—After months of bubbling tensions and threats of all-out war, Ukraine has made the shock decision to grant one of President Vladimir Putin’s greatest wishes. As far as overtures go, this was a grand gesture indeed. Ukraine has charged former President Petro Poroshenko—who is described as “Washington’s puppet” in Moscow—with state treason and financing terrorism. The longtime enemy of Putin faces as much as 15 years in prison if convicted. Even more delicious for Moscow, Poroshenko was charged over the same scandal that has already ensnared Putin’s ally Victor Medvechuk, which involved funneling public money to the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine through illegal coal purchases. Pro-Kremlin politicians have repeatedly insisted that it was Washington who gave President Vladimir Zelensky orders to arrest Putin’s ally Medvechuk in May. “Washington wants to see Russians and Ukrainians kill each other. The pro-Moscow politician Medvechuk is under house arrest in Kyiv, just as Washington told Zelensky to do,” Sergei Markov, co-chairman of the National Strategic Council of Russia, said in an interview for The Daily Beast. “Now Zelensky goes after the West’s beloved Poroshenko to show Washington he can make his own decisions.” Russian Citizens Are Now Being Prepped for Nuclear War It was Poroshenko who brought American paratroopers to Ukraine in 2015 to train local soldiers, which included former Soviet officers. To Moscow, it sounded like the ultimate betrayal. Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said at the time: “It provokes future escalation.” Moscow sees the move against Poroshenko by Ukraine’s current leadership as a beneficial move. Markov was one of those pro-Kremlin experts who was pleased to hear about the investigation into Poroshenko, who he described as the “leader of the junta.” Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman as well as a politician, was not at home when prosecutors showed up on his doorstep on Monday afternoon to formally charge him. The post-revolutionary leader was more than 600 miles away, taking part in an international conference in Warsaw. The speculation about his fate in pro-Kremlin circles is intense, as people ask where the ex-president will land when the dust settles. Will Poroshenko return to Ukraine? Will he end up in jail? In response, Poroshenko posted a video addressing Ukrainians on Facebook, promising to return home in January. That would mean he is going to miss his first appearance on the treason case, which is scheduled for Dec. 23. “It makes the Kremlin happy to see any failures of democracy in Ukraine, especially political repressions or unjust persecutions of an ex-president,” said Stanislav Belkovsky, a Moscow-based expert on Ukraine affairs. “This scandal adds to Moscow's argument: Look, things fall apart in Ukraine. Let’s annex territories in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions now.” The idea of Russia moving on to recognize the independence or even annex the breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine is gaining traction in both Kyiv and Moscow—as a solution to the military escalation on the border between the neighboring countries. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin on Tuesday that U.S. mercenaries had intended to poison water in the Donetsk region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, there are 120 American military contractors serving in Ukraine. “Moscow uses this serious accusation to prepare the ground for moving on and recognizing sovereignty or annexing the self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine,“ Belkovsky told The Daily Beast. “This is a story in the fashion of Stalin’s repression of Jewish doctors who the KGB [falsely] claimed were poisoning patients.” Ever since the pro-Moscow President Victor Yanukovych was ousted from Ukraine, Moscow’s politicians, experts and propagandists have been constantly telling Russian television viewers about Ukraine’s fragile economy and political scandals. Poroshenko is described as the leader of “the party of war.” His party is popular among nationalistic patriots, but many experts in Ukraine remember his rule as utterly corrupt. “Poroshenko is a real crook, this is clear to everybody—he was making money on his chocolate factories in Russia and Crimea, while Ukrainian soldiers were dying on the frontlines,” said Yevgeny Kiselev, one of Russia’s most prominent broadcasters who moved to Ukraine after the Kremlin’s crackdown on independent journalism. Throughout the seven-year military conflict between Kyiv and Moscow-backed militias in eastern Ukraine—which has cost around 13,000 lives—Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs and politicians have continued to make money from shadowy business deals. Ukrainian authorities now accuse Poroshenko of being involved in one of these illegal schemes. They say he used public funds to buy coal from Russian-backed separatists despite a ban on any such transactions that would effectively fund the separatists. He is also accused of doing business with Russian public officials. “Poroshenko claimed there was a shortage of coal and organized supplies from occupied territories, which would help the self-proclaimed republics earn money,” Yulia Mendel, ex-press secretary of the current Ukrainian president, told The Daily Beast. “The payment was done in cash, which was brought to the occupied territories by the security services of Ukraine.” Russians Have Suddenly Stopped Buying Putin’s Anti-American Propaganda Ukraine had already charged Medvechuk, another oligarch, who is known for his close ties to Putin. Medvechuk was placed under home arrest in May on charges of high treason, aiding terrorist organizations and trading coal with “occupied territories” controlled by Moscow-backed rebels. Now prosecutors charge Poroshenko with the same crimes, accusing him of giving Medvechuk authority and therefore “financing terrorists.” Poroshenko’s defense lawyer Ilya Novikov insists the case is “purely political,” that his client is innocent and will surely return to Ukraine. “When Zelensky was coming to power, he promised he would go after Poroshenko, his main political opponent. Since then Ukraine opened more than 100 criminal cases against Poroshenko but failed to prove his guilt in any of them,” Novikov told The Daily Beast in an interview Tuesday. The threat of a destructive war is still hanging over Russia and Ukraine as tens of thousands of troops continue to mass on both sides of the border. Last week, Putin demanded NATO “accept the obligation to exclude further expansion of NATO to Ukraine” and to withdraw all NATO military bases and infrastructure from Eastern Europe built after 1997. Markov suggested the noisy complaints are all part of Putin’s plan to seize more land in Ukraine. “It’s possible that Putin will increase the tensions until the West will feel relieved to hear we recognize the sovereignty of Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics or make them a part of Russia, like we did with Crimea,” he said. After the charges were leveled at Poroshenko, Olexandr Martynenko, director general of Interfax Ukraine, said Kyiv was trying to keep its options open. “There is not much hope left of a peace deal with Russia, but Kyiv is not burning bridges with Moscow either.” Martynenko said there was a real chance that Putin would annex sections of Ukraine in 2022. “It is quite possible that Russia will annex the separatist territories in Donbas and Luhansk next year in the same way they had done it with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, that is a natural solution for Russia in the current situation,” he said. “Ukraine will definitely protest against the annexation but both countries will eventually live on with the new political watershed. Once it happens, Russia will most probably bring in its peacekeepers, so all the fighting is going to stop. At least 50 percent of Ukrainians would feel relieved about the idea of no more war, relieved to see the end of at least this phase of tensions.” Ukrainian officials fear that, ultimately, the West won’t do enough to stop Russian aggression. “Putin knows there is weaknesses in the unity in Europe and in the United States—we already hear cynical voices on the West calling to give Putin what he wants,” Svitlana Zalishchuk, foreign affairs adviser for Ukraine’s state energy firm Naftogaz, told The Daily Beast. Ukraine knows it may have to look after itself, whoever that means sacrificing. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/22/2021,"Cases of the omicron variant of COVID-19 have been rising, now accounting for 73% of new infections last week, federal health officials said Monday. Numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown nearly a six-fold increase in omicron’s share of infections in only one week. While the CDC says it's still unknown how rapidly omicron spreads as compared to the delta variant of the virus, it will likely spread more rapidly than the original strain of COVID-19. It's possible to get the omicron variant even if you're vaccinated, but you are less likely to experience severe illness, hospitalization and death, however, breakthrough infections are still likely to occur, according to the CDC. To help fight omicron, the CDC recommends everyone ages 5 and older be vaccinated, and everyone 18 and older to get a booster shot. Mask wearing indoors or in areas of high community transmission are also recommended. COVID-19: Omicron variant sweeping across nation, now accounts for 73% of new cases; Moderna 3rd dose effective vs. omicron: COVID-19 updates More: Yes, omicron has overtaken delta. No, it's not March 2020 Omicron, the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet, can be pronounced in a few ways, which are both correct. Merriam-Webster says you can either say ""AH-muh-krahn"" or ""OH-muh-krahn."" The World Health Organization, which chose omicron as the next variant name, picked it over 13th and 14th Greek alphabet letters nu and xi, because nu sounds like ""new"" and xi sounds like a common surname. There's still not a lot of information on the difference between symptoms of the omicron variant and other COVID-19 variants, if there are any, but the CDC recently released a briefing with the most commonly reported symptoms. They include: Cough. Fatigue. Congestion. Runny nose. Kids and vaccines: Holiday school break opens a window to get kids vaccinated Rapid tests: Biden to announce free rapid COVID-19 tests and help for overwhelmed hospitals amid omicron threat Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. Fever or chills. Cough. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Fatigue. Muscle or body aches. Headache. New loss of taste or smell. Sore throat. Congestion or runny nose. Nausea or vomiting. Diarrhea. Are the symptoms between delta and previous variants any different? In short, it's not completely clear. COVID-19: The omicron variant is in the Cincinnati region. Now what? Like COVID-19, the symptoms are often: Coughing. Sneezing. Runny or stuffy nose. Sore throat. Tiredness. Sometimes a fever. Symptoms usually appear one to three days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Unlike COVID-19, a cold is usually harmless and cold-sufferers generally recover in three to 10 days. The flu is different from a cold, and it can often come on suddenly, according to the CDC. Symptoms can include: Fever, or feeling feverish and chills. It is important to not that not everyone with the flu will have a fever. Cough. Sore throat. Runny or stuffy nose. Muscle or body aches. Headaches. Fatigue. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, although its more common in children than adults. There are some key differences in symptoms. Currently, The Weather Channel's allergy tracker for Cincinnati is listed as ""none,"" with no grass, tree and ragweed pollen counts. Common allergy symptoms include: Runny nose. Sneezing. Red, swollen eyes. Itchy eyes. Itchy nose. Tickle in the throat. Rarely a fever.

12/22/2021,"Ali Alexandre predicted that Trump will be subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee. The committee has already subpoenaed dozens of Trump officials and allies in recent months. Trump failed to block the committee from accessing White House records using executive privilege. A top organizer of the January 6 ""Stop the Steal"" rally predicted that former President Donald Trump would be subpoenaed by the House committee investigating the Capitol riot. Ali Alexander, who on December 9 took part in an eight-hour-long, closed-door deposition before the committee, told InfoWars on Tuesday that he believes Trump would be summoned following efforts to connect him to the activities of rally organizers. ""They want a nexis — is what my lawyers call it — between the people who were violent, unjustified violent, or vandalism and then you and me and the activists,"" Alexander told the InfoWars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. ""So that they can connect it to a Trump staffer and then Trump. Folks, Trump will be subpoenaed by this committee. Breaking news. Trump will entirely be subpoenaed by this committee."" The ""Stop the Steal"" rally partly organized by Alexander had immediately preceded the Capitol riot, which left five people dead. Trump had told a crowd assembled at that rally that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and encouraged them to march to the Capitol and ""fight like hell."" The committee has in recent months subpoenaed more than 100 people including dozens of Trump officials and allies. They include the former Trump White House officials Stephen Miller and Kayleigh McEnany, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Trump's longtime confidante Roger Stone. Alex Jones himself was also subpoenaed. Trump sought to invoke executive privilege to block the committee from securing White House records, but that attempt was rejected by a federal appeals court. A set of six subpoenas issued earlier in December included the Ohio congressional candidate Max Miller, a former Trump White House and campaign aide. They appeared to indicate efforts by the committee to draw direct connections between the rally organizers and Trump's inner circle. Miller helped organize the rally and met with Trump in the West Wing to discuss who would be speaking, Insider's Eliza Relman and Sonam Sheth reported. ""Some of the witnesses we subpoenaed today apparently worked to stage the rallies on January 5th and 6th, and some appeared to have had direct communication with the former President regarding the rally at the Ellipse directly preceding the attack on the US Capitol,"" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, said in a December 10 statement.

12/22/2021,"Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, on Tuesday called on Fox News to fire host Jesse Watters for targeting him with violent rhetoric at a conservative conference earlier this week. “That’s awful that he said that. And he’s going to go, very likely, unaccountable,” Fauci told CNN of Watters’ remarks. “I mean, whatever network he’s on is not going to do anything for him. I mean, that’s crazy. The guy should be fired on the spot.” Speaking on Monday at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest conference, Watters encouraged attendees to rhetorically “ambush” Fauci with dubious questions about the National Institutes of Health allegedly funding “gain-of-function” research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “Now you go in for the kill shot. The kill shot? With an ambush? Deadly. Because he doesn’t see it coming,” Watters said. Fauci — who is President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser and has served for 37 years as director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — on Tuesday described Watters’ remarks as “horrible.” “The only thing that I have ever done throughout these two years is to encourage people to practice good public health practices: to get vaccinated, to be careful in public settings, to wear a mask,” Fauci said. “And for that, you have some guy out there saying that people should be giving me a kill shot to ambush me? I mean, what kind of craziness is there in society these days?” Fox News defended Watters in a statement, saying: “Based on watching the full clip and reading the entire transcript, it’s more than clear that Jesse Watters was using a metaphor for asking hard-hitting questions to Dr. Fauci about gain-of-function research and his words have been twisted completely out of context.” Watters is a co-host of the Fox News weekday show “The Five” and the host of his own weekend show, “Watters’ World.” Fox News hosts, as well as Republican congressional lawmakers, have repeatedly targeted Fauci throughout the coronavirus pandemic with inflammatory and personal rhetoric. He began receiving armed security protection last April amid online attacks by supporters of former President Donald Trump, and he has spoken publicly about threats to his family. Earlier this month, Lara Logan, a Fox News personality and host on its streaming service, compared Fauci to the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele — prompting Fauci to rebuke the network for not taking disciplinary action against Logan. “What I find striking … is how she gets no discipline whatsoever from the Fox network — how they can let her say that with no comment and no disciplinary action,” Fauci told MSNBC. “I’m astounded by that.”",Politics/Politico,‘The guy should be fired on the spot’: Fauci rebukes Fox News host over violent rhetoric,https://news.yahoo.com/guy-fired-spot-fauci-rebukes-143213409.html
