3/5/2022,"Jasper Llewellyn and Mike O’Malley fell for folk music fast, growing up in the Sussex countryside in the late 00s during the nu-folk era. They learned guitar, banjo and mandolin, could harmonise thanks to singing in school choirs, and busked their way through their teens, playing traditional American folk at weddings. After Jasper met Casper Hughes at uni, the trio got a band together in 2016, although back then caroline (Mike misheard “cowlung”) was a private obsession, a long way from making an album as strange and beautiful as their self-titled debut. Endlessly discussing and designing their spectral, unpredictable songs saw them signed to Rough Trade despite just one brilliant single (Dark Blue) and four gigs in four years. Tempting five more players into the studio filled out their sound – bass, violin, trumpet, woodwind, sax – but quiet is always a weapon in caroline’s hands. “The more people you have waiting for a cue on stage, the more intensifying it becomes,” explains Llewellyn. “We normally play on the floor in the round, with everyone putting energy into the middle of the room.” Some might find caroline an entirely private experience, but their shapeshifting music seeps out of any box you might try to keep it in, slippery as mango flesh on an ice rink. “We don’t want you to get lost in it, we want you to feel invigorated and present. It’s physical, intense, sweaty.” caroline is out now on Rough Trade.

3/5/2022,"My name is Allan. I am an addict. A seedaholic, to tell the truth. From here on in, for the next few months, I’ll lie awake wondering where my next hit is coming from. No stash is ever enough. There is no seed sobriety. I have dealers everywhere. From local stores. From far away. All over the internet. From midsummer on, I’ll carry paper bags or envelopes in case I spot a perfect flower or plant on a wall, on a roadside. I’ll wait until the dried head forms. I stalk seed that isn’t mine. I have drawers and tins, bowls, bags and boxes of the stuff. And I can’t stop buying more. I have been like this for much of my life. Since I first copped from my foster father. He gave my brother and I each a square-metre piece of land and a packet of seed. Nasturtiums for me and marigolds for Christopher. Child-proof, fool-proof, flower kiddie crack. I grow them still. Everywhere. Bright, prolific, forgiving, pretty much guaranteed to grow. Start with these two. Choose your colours, find a supplier. I go for purest orange, single-petal calendula (pot marigold), though I am also drawn to the modern “flashback” style. Calendula seeds look like tiny sea fossils. The flowers are like the kind that children draw. Nasturtiums come in many colours and survive on near-neglect. I buy many varieties but, for starters, I’d go for climbing nasturtiums from Ben at Higgledy Garden, my favourite flower-seed dealer. My daughter Kala lives just a few doors from us and we always sow Ben’s half-hardy annual seed collection (over-generously topped up with more) on or around her birthday in May. Ben is good on Instagram, too. My other favoured seed supplier, though maybe more for herbs and vegetables than flowers, is Paolo at Franchi: Seeds of Italy. His colourful racks of packs are often to be seen in Italian delicatessens and in many good garden centres. The amounts are generous, the prices modest, the germination super-reliable. Check through the various sections online (there is an Eden Project collection, a chef selection, and I plunder the Golden Line for wild and semi-wild flowers). Much as I need a regular hit of packet seed, a plea here, too, for saving your own. It’s the most satisfying fix of all. And honestly easy. For peas and beans, say, leave a few of the fattest, happiest pods to dry on the vine. Pop the seed into a paper envelope or bag, store in a cool, dry place. Done. For leaf vegetables, say, beetroot or chicory, amaranth, choose a handsome healthy plant or three and simply leave them to live a longer life, wait for flower, for them to go to seed. Shake, as before, into a paper bag or envelope, store, sort and leave to dry fully. For flowers, the same: mark your selection of perfect blooms, watch them fade and dry, sort and keep in a cool place. Start simply at first; stick to annuals, such as calendula, nasturtiums, poppies, nigella. If in doubt, there are many specialist sites and films on the internet. It won’t stop you buying pretty packets. It might even deepen an addiction. But, for me, growing flowers or food from seed I’ve saved is as good as gardening gets. If it all sounds too much fuss (and, honestly, I understand), then pop into your local garden centre, shop online, start with a few flowers or veg you like the look of. Most young kids love growing sunflowers and picking beans and peas. You can fill a small garden or lots of plant pots for around £20. You don’t have to be Monty Don.

3/5/2022,"One of the biggest stealth success stories of recent years has been Big Thief, a US four-piece who have blossomed from scratchy beginnings to become one of the most prolific and adored leftfield guitar bands of recent times. On record, it’s not always clear why. It is often hard to hear the forest for the trees in Big Thief’s music. Immediacy is no guarantor of good art, but Big Thief’s bangers are rare orchids indeed: there’s Paul, from their debut album, 2016’s Masterpiece, which they don’t play tonight. (Admittedly, that’s a boss move.) Not, from Two Hands, one of their twin 2019 albums, was nominated for two Grammys and praised by Barack Obama. It eventually proves pivotal on this first night of a sold out four-night residency in London. Much of Big Thief’s sprawling recorded output has long seemed pleasant, if a little worthy and unfocused – folk-rock, or thereabouts, that pairs singer and guitarist Adrianne Lenker’s oblique lyrics with intelligent, interlocking contributions from the rest of the band that can often take a few listens to bed in. And so it proves tonight, for a few songs. They are a band you absolutely want to love – female-fronted, searching and sensitive, organically grown, tackling themes like the infinite as well as confessionals about love and loss. In Lenker, they have an heroic frontperson who, tonight, sports a number two buzzcut, whose childhood experiences in a religious cult and fluid sexuality have informed her band’s work. There are parallels here with other singular voices, like Sufjan Stevens, or Hurray for the Riff Raff’s Alynda Segarra. And in guitarist Buck Meek, Big Thief also have a musician so admired he skipped several grades of dues-paying and landed the plum spot in Bob Dylan’s acclaimed Shadow Kingdom live stream band of last year. As a unit, Big Thief have also overcome a vast existential threat – not Covid, but the divorce of their founding partnership, Lenker and Meek, a conscious uncoupling that has seen both parties survive, meet other people and break up with some of them, with band members releasing several solo albums and yet remaining committed to their “magical” joint project. Group therapy has been key. But for all this, Big Thief can sometimes present as overearnest, hippy-ish North Americans with little quality control. Take Max Oleartchik, whose tasselled bass, moustache and pigtails ensemble tonight hint at time spent near drumming circles. When Big Thief attempt something lighthearted, they end up with a strange song about potatoes – Spud Infinity, which unsuccessfully rhymes “knish” with “finish”. Tonight, though, it swiftly becomes apparent that Big Thief are extraordinary, albeit in bursts. What was shruggy on record comes to vivid, pulsating life. On Change, mercurial guitarist Meek doesn’t so much play a solo as sprinkle beatific notes around with a series of birdlike twitches. He spends most of the evening on the balls of his feet, using the space, making everything sing as though by osmosis. Oleartchik often plays on one knee; throughout the gig, he will wander away from his amp and sit or crouch on the stage in, against all odds, an unaffected manner. When Big Thief truly power up, it’s a privilege to be proved so wrong about them. The encore is Sparrow, from Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You, a double album released last month, in which the biblical Eve takes centre stage. “She has the poison inside her! She talks to snakes and they guide her!” seethes Lenker in character as Adam, a figure whose distress is probably accusation, but could be concern. Great on record, hair-raising live, Not is a revelation, worth the price of admission alone. It’s a song about absence, in which Lenker tries to define something by what it is not. More audacious than that, half the song is given over to Lenker’s electric guitar solo – a sceptic-converting firework display derived from the spacious Neil Young school, but wound far more tightly, full of frustration and suffering, angry and ecstatic at the same time. Lenker solos on electric a few more times, an approach that raises the question why Big Thief bother with so much mellifluous Americana filler when they could routinely blow the roof off every venue with Lenker’s gnarly power and Meek’s revolutionary un-playing. The answer is: because Big Thief are an awkward bunch who love roots music, healthily represented on their recent double album. As though they didn’t have enough new songs to play, the band essay a handful of even newer, unrecorded tracks – one of them, as yet untitled, finished on the ferry over from Ireland, Lenker tells us. Happily, Forgiver, also new, is another electric stunner, again indebted to Neil Young, about forbidden love. “Your daddy wants you to love a man,” Lenker sings, “and if you keep your arms around me it could ruin the plan.” She delivers some of it with her face in her hands, then embraces her guitar as though it were the lover from the lyrics.",Arts/Music,Big Thief review – a revelatory set from the adored US folk-rockers,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/05/big-thief-shepherds-bush-empire-london-live-review-adrianne-lenker
3/5/2022,"Since it’s almost International Women’s Day, shall we play a quick themed quiz? Question number one: does gender inequality exist? Tough question, really. On the one hand women in many countries are still paid and promoted less than men; expected to carry the burden of unpaid caregiving; subjected to a “pink tax”, which means they may more for common household items; under-represented in government and the executive suite; receive far less funding for startups; have their reproductive rights curtailed; are at greater risk for sexual harassment and domestic violence; are more likely to live in poverty; and are also more likely to be illiterate adults thanks to gendered disparities in access to education. On the other hand, some men reckon women have it pretty good these days. So, like I said, tough question. The research firm Ipsos, along with the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership at King’s College London, asked this and several other questions to over 20,000 people in 30 countries ahead of IWD. The answers show that while much progress has been made in terms of attitudes towards women’s rights, there is still a long way to go. Let’s start with the existence of gender inequality, shall we? The good-ish news is that a majority of people around the world believe that it exists. (Hooray for recognizing the obvious!) Nevertheless, it’s still a little depressing that a not-significant 18% believe it does not. Surprise, surprise, men are more likely to think that gender inequality is a fiction (21% v 14%). Saudi Arabia, where women were only recently allowed to travel without a male guardian’s approval, is top of the charts when it comes to men saying that gender inequality doesn’t exist. Thirty-seven per cent of men in Saudi Arabia believe that compared to 30% of men in Australia, 22% of men in the US, 19% of men in Great Britain and 7% of men in Japan. More goodish news is that, despite the rantings and ravings of conservatives like Josh Hawley and Tucker Carlson, most men don’t see gender equality as a threat. A third of men in the countries surveyed think feminism does more harm than good (32%) and that traditional masculinity is under threat (33%); a fifth of men (23%) believe feminism has resulted in men losing out in terms of economic or political power or socially. While those numbers are uncomfortable large, it’s still worth taking solace in the fact that the majority of men don’t feel this way. Where in the world has the men with the most fragile feelings? Russia leads the charts. Fifty-eight per cent of Russian men believe that traditional masculinity is under threat–although it’s worth noting that 58% of Russian women agreed. Fifty-six per cent of Russian men believe feminism does more harm than good. There are lots of interesting insights in the Ipsos research, and the report is well worth a dig through. What stood out the most for me, however, was the worrying suggestion that the internet has normalized abusive behaviour among younger generations. The survey found that while the vast majority of people considered harmful and abusive online behaviour to be unacceptable, younger generations were more likely to find it acceptable; perhaps because they have grown up in a digital world, and more frequent internet usage was associated with viewing online harm as acceptable. Similarly, while 78% of people think women should not have to put up with online abuse, agreement is lower among men and younger generations. Alarmingly, the report also found that while victim-blaming attitudes toward violence against women are held by a minority, they are more common among men and younger generations. In today’s connected world, the lines between digital life and “real” life are increasingly blurred. When tech companies shrug their shoulders at abuse online, they help to normalize abuse offline. When you normalize harassment on the internet, you normalize it everywhere. Tech bros are constantly telling us how their products are propelling us into the future, but it seems increasingly clear that, when it comes to gender relations, they’re pulling us into the past. Two e-commerce bros (who had previously made a killing in producing colouring books for adults) bought the domain name knitting.com with big plans to get rich quick. How exactly? Well you can read all about it for yourself in this gripping yarn from Input Mag, but their strategy seemed to be 20% racism, 20% sexism, and 60% condescension. The knitting community has risen against the two men and they are now yelling about “bullying” and insisting they can’t be racist because they’re both married to Chinese women. “Feminism is one of the few opposition movements in contemporary Russia that has not been destroyed by the waves of persecution launched by Vladimir Putin’s government,” write Russian feminists in Jacobin. (Why? Because Putin didn’t take them seriously as a dangerous political movement). “Feminism as a political force cannot be on the side of a war of aggression and military occupation,” they state. It’s a point that I don’t think can be stressed enough in a world where feminism is often cynically leveraged to justify war. Republican Danny Bentley said: “Did you know that a Jewish woman has less cancer of the cervix than any other race … And why is that? Because the Jewish women only have one sex partner … They don’t have multiple sex partners.” As well as providing his unhinged and unsolicited opinions on the sexual habits of Jewish women he also made a number of false and antisemitic comments about the origins of abortion pills. Can’t have people using taxpayer money to spread dangerous ideas like “women and men are equal”, eh? Why? It’s not entirely clear. But a new study demonstrates that there’s been a substantial shift in discourse in the US media. Writing in the Guardian, the study’s authors note their data suggests “that it is changes in media coverage that seem to predict shifts in public perceptions around race and gender discrimination – not the other way around”. An LA mega-mansion boasting 21 bedrooms, 49 bathrooms, a cigar lounge, and a “philanthropy pavilion” has sold for a fraction of its original $500mn asking price. The hideous home, nicknamed “The One”, was originally promoted as the “biggest and most expensive modern home in America.” However its final sale price of $141m means it’s actually only the third-most expensive home ever sold in LA. Time, methinks, to tax the rich.",Opinion/Opinion,"One in three men thinks feminism does more harm than good.

3/5/2022,"In a giant food depot in Poland, a few miles from the border with Belarus, thousands of people, many of them women and children wrapped in woollen blankets, are crammed together in corridors and hallways. As Polish locals and volunteers frantically work alongside soldiers to try to distribute food and water to those most in need, buses pull up outside carrying more shellshocked and exhausted people needing help. There is no attempt to register the new arrivals. There is no time. Just over a week since Russia invaded Ukraine, those working here know that this crisis has just begun. Since the violence began, more than 650,000 people have crossed into Poland, leaving their lives behind and becoming refugees. Poland’s government, which rose to power in 2015 on an anti-refugee platform, has promised to welcome all those fleeing the war. Yet years of nationalist rhetoric have left the country with a skeletal immigration system and lacking the capacity to cope with what the UN warned could be the “greatest refugee crisis of the century”. Thousands of volunteers, mainly students, are working day and night to distribute food, water, blankets, tents, toys and medicines to up to 80,000 people crossing the 300-mile border between Ukraine and Poland every day. In Warsaw alone, more than 4,000 locals have volunteered to take refugees into their homes. “I have been alive for some years now, and I have never seen anything like this, such public mobilisation,” said 57-year-old Roman Pogorzelski from Warsaw. “Everyone is united; the only thing we’re asking is what more can we do – what other sanctions can we put on Russia, what aid can we send.” Everyone he knows, he says, is engaged in helping somehow, hosting refugees in their home or raising donations. On LinkedIn, he has seen colleagues organising trucks to carry medical aid into Ukraine. When Pogorzelski’s daughter called last weekend to ask if he would take into his home four young women – international students from Kenya, fleeing Ukraine – he and his wife did not hesitate. “In a situation like this, there is only one thing you can do,” he said. “We Poles understand the meaning of war.” The willingness of ordinary citizens like Pogorzelski and his wife to volunteer their time, money and homes to help their eastern neighbours has been a great relief to the Polish government. So far, close to all of the refugees arriving in Poland from Ukraine have found accommodation provided by citizens, private businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). But experts worry what will happen in the long term, when the refugees will need their own homes, jobs and school places and the underfunded NGOs have run out of money. “The first wave of enthusiasm will be over soon and without the system there will be a serious humanitarian crisis going on,” said Anna Alboth from the NGO Grupa Granica. “The state, instead of investing in the migration system – refugee shelters, lawyers or psychologists – has spent thousands of euros in building the wall on the Belarusianborder.” Just over a week since the invasion, and with violence escalating inside Ukraine, the refugee reception points offering food and medical assistance organised by the government are imploding. Although a spokesperson for the ministry has said that work on a new bill that will outline a long-term strategy for refugees is under way, NGOs that have been dealing with the bulk of the relief effort are yet to be offered any financial support from the authorities. In a room inside the Centre for the Meeting of Cultures, in the eastern Polish city of Lublin, dozens of young men and women working for the small refugee charity Homo Faber are answering calls from thousands of Ukrainians in need of assistance. The Polish government, unable to cope with the huge flood of requests, published the phone number for Homo Faber on its official website and now the charity is overwhelmed. ‘‘We are angry,’’ says Karolina Wierzbińska, one of the founders of Homo Faber. ‘‘So far we have received 2,600 phone calls from Ukrainians in need of assistance. And we need to pay our employees, who are working 24 hours a day. If this crisis lasts for months, many NGOs risk going bankrupt. And I don’t really know how it will turn out. We believe authorities in Poland do not have a plan on how to manage this crisis in the long run. Quite simply, they are not ready.” Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Homo Faber had been focused on another humanitarian crisis: trying to help refugees on Poland’s other border being pushed back by border guards into Belarus. “Last week we received a visit from a group of border guard officers here at our headquarters,” says Anna Dąbrowska, president of Homo Faber. ‘‘They came to us asking us to cooperate, to help the Ukrainians. We couldn’t believe it. Those were the border guards, the same border guards, who made our job difficult while we were trying to help Middle Eastern asylum seekers entering Poland from Belarus.’’ Support for Ukrainian refugees, and opposition to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the country, have united – at least momentarily – the notoriously polarised Polish public and parliament. Over 90% of respondents in a recent survey said that they were in favour of admitting Ukrainian refugees, while the opposition leader, Donald Tusk, pledged his support for the government. Yet the cracks have already begun to show in the system. “Humanitarian aid is not cheap. We are already seeing disagreements between local authorities about where the funding for integration of refugees is going to come from,” said Aleks Szczerbiak, politics professor from Sussex University, pointing to the mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, who has been complaining of lack of support from central government as thousands of refugees arrive ino the capital every day. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens like Pogorzelski remain determined to do their bit during the crisis. “We are going to help for as long as it is necessary,” he said. “Now nothing is certain. The last two weeks changed everything. We know we could be next.”",News/Global development,‘We understand what war means’: Poles rush to aid Ukraine’s refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/05/poland-rush-to-aid-ukraine-refugees-russia-war
