3/25/2022,"Intercepted radio transmissions reveal Russians ordering troops to target residential areas. In one clip, a Russian is telling a soldier to ""cover the residential area with artillery,"" according to the New York Times. He was also ordered to first remove ""property"" from the area — likely referring to Russian personnel or equipment. Intercepted radio transmissions reveal Russians ordered troops in Ukraine to target residential areas, the New York Times reported. Audio from the unsecured radio networks obtained by The Times show Russian troops discussing targets while advancing on the Ukrainian town of Makariv on February 27. In one bit of radio chatter, a Russian is heard ordering a military member to ""cover"" residential areas ""with artillery"" once the ""property"" is removed, according to The Times' translation. New York Times journalist Christiaan Triebert reported that ""property"" was likely code for ""Russian personnel or equipment."" A Russian who identifies himself in the recording as ""Yug-95"" told soldier ""Buran-30"" that a ""decision has been made to remove the first 'property' from the residential area,"" according to a translation by the New York Times. He then instructed the soldier to ""cover the residential area with artillery,"" The Times reported. He repeated the orders twice, The Times reported. Another clip reveals Russian soldiers appearing to yell at each other after they came under fire in Makariv. ""My situation is very tense, tanks are approaching,"" Buran-30 said in an intercepted radio conversation, according to The Times' translation. ""I don't know whose tanks they are, cannot identify them. There is a drone over the area and the area is under fire from all directions."" He said he was under fire and that he was stuck, according to The Times, and was told to request air support, but it never happened. According to The Times translations, Yug-95 then responded by saying ""You fucking forgot about the fucking air support! You forgot! Over!"" The Times' audio-visual investigators teamed up with ham radio operators and open source groups to obtain the radio transmissions, the paper said. The paper said the recordings ""reveal an army struggling with logistical problems and communication failures."" It's unclear why Russian troops were using unsecured radio networks to communicate, but The Verge reported that it has become normal during Russia's invasion into Ukraine.

3/25/2022,"Ukrainian intelligence officials have claimed the Kremlin is preparing to seal off Crimea in order to block the exit of any ""panicked"" Russians trying to flee. In 2014, Russia seized Ukraine's southern peninsula of Crimea, an area of significant strategic importance in an invasion which marked what one Western intelligence official described as the ""creeping militarisation"" of the Black Sea. While Nato and the international community deemed the annexation illegal, they failed to stop it and Moscow has since established two federal ""subjects"" in the area - the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol. Eight years on and Putin mounted a full scale invasion of Ukraine, in an apparent attempt to annex more land in the east of the country, specifically the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. However, Western officials believe the invasion is not going to plan, with Moscow frustrated by the lack of progress. The war has sparked numerous protests across Russia. On Wednesday, the intelligence department of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence claimed in a Facebook post that the Kremlin plans to block bridges, ferries and air connections from the mainland to Crimea in order to prevented panicking Russians from fleeing the region. The post said Russia is now holding 600,000 Russian citizens ""hostage"" who are ""illegally on the peninsula"". The statement said: ""Putin's authorities are trying to react to panic moods among Russian citizens who illegally moved to Ukrainian Crimea after February 2014.

It added that families of Russian officers and officials in Sevastopol have ""urgently"" sold real estate and are removing assets from the peninsula. These claims have not been verified, however it is clear that there is some anger aimed at Putin's invasion in the Russian homeland. On 4 March, Moscow enacted two laws that criminalised independent war reporting and protesting the war, with penalties of up to 15 years in prison. Three days after those laws came into force police reportedly detained more than 4,300 protesters in 56 different cities, according to the OVD-Info independent protest monitoring group. Some Russian state-controlled media carried short reports about the protests but they did not feature high in news bulletins. Russia's RIA news agency said the Manezhnaya Square in Moscow, adjoining the Kremlin, had been ""liberated"" by police, who had arrested some participants of an unsanctioned protest against the military operation in Ukraine. The last Russian protests with a similar number of arrests were in January 2021, when thousands demanded the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny after he was arrested on returning from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning. In recent days, there has been mounting speculation as to the scale of Russian troop losses, with one Nato source estimating that up to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the past month. The anonymous officer said that battlefield casualties suffered by Russia are thought to total between 30,000 and 40,000 since Putin launched his invasion on February 24. On Thursday, British military intelligence said that ""Russian forces have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine."" In an effort to bolster their troops, Russia is likely looking at bringing reservists and conscription, further intelligence has suggested. An update added: ""Russia is likely now looking to mobilise its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses.""

3/25/2022,"STORY: ""We are concerned partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, the United States and NATO allies of preparing to use chemical and biological weapons,"" he told reporters after a NATO summit in Brussels, adding any use of chemical weapons would have widespread consequences. Stoltenberg said leaders decided to provide support to Ukraine against chemical and biological weapons, install four new battlegroups in its eastern border and enhance air and maritime capabilities in the region. Russia's invasion of Ukraine a month ago triggered Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War Two and led Western nations to fundamentally rethink their defence policies. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine.
