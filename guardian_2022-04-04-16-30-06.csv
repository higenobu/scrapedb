4/4/2022,"Three Indigenous spears taken by James Cook will be returned to Sydney for the first time in 250 years. The spears, described as “exceptionally significant”, have been loaned by the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge for display at the University of Sydney’s Chau Chak Wing Museum for three months from Friday. Cook first landed in Australia in 1770, upon Kamay land. There, his Endeavour crew was resisted by Gweagal men from the clan of Dharawal nation, traditional owners of the southern area of what is now called Botany Bay. The Gweagal men were shot at, withdrew, and 40 of their spears were stolen, as recounted in the journals of Cook’s Endeavour voyagers. “We … thought it no improper measure to take away with us all the lances [spears] which we could find about the houses, amounting in number to forty or fifty,” Joseph Banks wrote on 29 April 1770. Now, three of the four remaining Kamay spears will join 37 contemporary spears symbolising those stolen on display at the University of Sydney’s Chau Chak Wing Museum. “The spears taken away by Cook and other members of the Endeavour’s crew are exceptionally significant,” Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA) director Prof Nicholas Thomas said. “They are the first artefacts collected by any European from any part of Australia, that remain extant and documented,” Thomas said. “They reflect the beginnings of a history of misunderstanding and conflict.” “These items are an important part of the cultural identity of the peoples they came from and of the knowledge they hold,” Prof Lisa Jackson Pulver, the university’s deputy vice-chancellor (Indigenous strategy and services), said. She said their display will ensure “ongoing cultural connection and practice”. Dr Paul Donnelly, acting director of the Chau Chak Wing Museum, said in a statement that “the university was taking a leading role in enabling conversations while providing a culturally safe space for the spears’ display”. In an effort to facilitate closer collaboration between museums and Indigenous communities, the temporary display will be the focus of education programs developed with the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council for the local Aboriginal and wider community.

4/4/2022,"The Post Office’s instructions for “finger gymnastics” contain 12 thorough steps, starting from “shaking every joint of the limp hand”, through to elaborate explanations of how to bend, stretch and shake every finger. These exercises were designed to prepare the digits of a 1950s “postal coder” starting their shift. Workout complete, coders would punch in the postcodes of more than 2,000 letters an hour – until the system became fully automated around the mid-90s. Many of us use our postcode every day, from entering it on a satnav to shopping online, without giving those letters and numbers much thought. A new exhibition at the Postal Museum seeks to change that. Sorting Britain: The Power of Postcodes takes in the beginnings of our area codes in ingenious Victorian London, to the 1930s and the marvellous red brick Post Office Research Station which started to develop automation, to the 1960s strikes as workers dealt with the incoming mechanisation and low wages, to the 1980s advertising campaigns and, now, the way we’re profiled by our postcode.Like a stamp on a letter, this exhibition is small but efficient and covers a lot of ground. “In the mid 1950s, the Post Office developed the first successful British sorting machine, known as Elsie,” says Chris Taft, head of collections. “All of the Post Office machines were given human names.” Indeed, as well as Elsie (Electronic Letter Sorting Indicator Equipment), there was Ernie (the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment, built to choose the winning numbers of premium bonds) – both given recognisable names so as not to spook the public with all this newfangled automation. Elsie had been born at the research station at Dollis Hill, north-west London, which opened in 1933. A poster paying tribute to “the men of Dollis Hill” – it was mostly men with the exception of a few women such as Dame Stephanie Shirley, who worked at the research station at the beginning of her engineering career – and their “modern miracles”, shows them testing everything from the lifespan of a rubber stamp to the effects of lightning on telegraph poles. These mid-century mavericks, depicted as clean-shaven if slightly dishevelled scientists, were developing a sorting machine and system that could code and process the increasing load of mail. Some of the technology for it had been used earlier for Colossus, the world’s first programmable electronic computer, which was designed at Dollis Hill by the Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers, and helped the Bletchley Park codebreakers during the second world war. There is an Elsie in the centre of the exhibition, a charming machine in that beautiful 50s mint green, with curves and cogs. Slots marked with the original black tape labels show newly coded addresses such as “Min of Soc Security”. A single operator could use it, but they would have to know their geography (if the sender hadn’t written the county on the envelope), as well as remember more than 140 codes that would sort the post, ensuring it got to the right part of the country. “The PostOffice realised that if they asked the public to write these codes on to the letters, that would aid the sorting process,” says Taft. “Then all the operators have to do is key in the code without having to memorise anything. That’s essentially where the postcode came from.” A new longer code, that we recognise today, was developed and trialled in Norwich in 1959 – despite some people saying they had no intention of using their new postcode when the price of postage was already too high (“HAVE NOT WRITTEN LETTERS SINCE POSTAGE WENT UP TO 3d” reads one feedback card in indignant capitals), the trial was successful and the postcode was rolled out to the rest of the country. By 1974 every address had one. Over the next decade, the Post Office ran advertising campaigns to encourage people to use theirs, until it was deemed that we had all got the message. Now, postcodes have become an integral part of life, but brought some negative effects the Post Office didn’t foresee. “People talk about the postcode lottery, how you might not be entitled to certain healthcare facilities based on your postcode,” says Taft. A postcode can affect property prices, and things such as car insurance. “You might live in a really quiet, safe road, but your car insurance might be inflated because you happen to be in a postcode area where crime is considered high.” You can probably remember your childhood postcode, and there can be an emotional attachment, or an importance placed on them, even though they’re simply “a tool for the Post Office”, says Taft. “Occasionally places and businesses do request postcode changes, or to be in a different postcode. The famous example is Wimbledon football club.” When AFC Wimbledon moved back to Plough Lane in 2020, their new stadium was less than 200 metres from the original, but it had slipped into a different postcode – many at the club, attached to the previous SW19 postcode, wanted it changed from SW17. “But it doesn’t really work like that,” adds Taft. “If you change your postcode, your post would end up in the wrong place. That’s all it is – a means of the Post Office knowing where to send your letter.” A postcode doesn’t respect political constituencies and often not even counties, it is just an everyday cipher that imposes a little bit of order on our lives.

4/4/2022,"While this week marks the six‑month anniversary of the Newcastle United takeover by a Saudi-led consortium fronted by the minority shareholders Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi, it seems an awful lot longer since images of home fans celebrating with unfettered Geordie abandon outside St James’ Park were first beamed around the world. Signed, sealed and controversially waved through by the Premier League during an international break bookended by defeats for the club against Wolves and Tottenham Hotspur, the change of ownership took place with Newcastle second from bottom of the table, ahead of only Norwich City and with just three points from seven games to their name. It would take another seven matches for them to chalk up their first win of this campaign but, while results may not have immediately improved under the new regime, the mood around Tyneside certainly did. Following more than a decade of what was, at the best of times, plodding, ambition-free mediocrity under Mike Ashley, Newcastle fans finally had grounds for what they saw as long overdue optimism even if – for some – it came at a moral price. Some, but by no means all, as the preponderance of Saudi flags hoisted alongside the social media avatars of many Newcastle supporters would soon testify. While a legal distinction was made between the majority shareholders, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia (chairman: Sheikh Mohammed Bin Salman), and the country which runs it (crown prince: Sheikh Mohammed Bin Salman), it was widely accepted the two entities were pretty much one and the same. Newcastle had joined Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain in becoming a state-owned club bought for image-laundering purposes, in the process swapping one billionaire with an almost heroic disregard for what anyone thinks of him, for another far more wealthy and apparently generous one who, it seems, just wants to be loved. Cue much finger-pointing, whatabouting and often vicious squabbling as many Newcastle fans, who had always been quick to point out the myriad shortcomings of their former proprietor, suddenly began taking grave exception to even the mildest criticism of his replacement. Questions regarding the suitability of Bin Salman as an owner owing to the claims of US intelligence that he approved the slaying of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi – a claim denied by the Saudi foreign ministry – plus his country’s sustained campaign of bombing in Yemen and the litany of human rights abuses visited upon many of his subjects have been fielded – and often dismissed – in a variety of ways veering from the reasoned to the downright deranged. In a sit-down interview with the Athletic shortly after the takeover was confirmed, Staveley, who along with her husband, Ghodoussi, is the public face and mouthpiece of the Newcastle ownership, paid lip service to these issues but only fleetingly, utterly unconvincingly and up to a point. “Human rights we take very seriously but our partner is PIF, not the Saudi state,” she said. “The separation issue has been resolved. It’s not sportswashing, it’s investment.” Less than a week later, the Athletic published another article. It explained quite clearly how, despite the best attempts of Staveley to create a clear distinction between the Saudi sovereign wealth fund from the state, the two are, as everyone knows, inextricably intertwined. “If Newcastle is owned by PIF, it is de facto controlled by the government of Saudi Arabia,” said Bradley Hope, the journalist and co-author of Blood and Oil: Mohammed bin Salman’s Ruthless Quest for Global Power. Meanwhile, in the wild west of the internet, all hell was breaking loose, with critics of the new ownership group accused of high-handed hypocrisy because they had once supported multiple Saudi‑supported businesses by checking their Facebook account in the back of an Uber on their way home to watch a movie on Disney+. Levels of whataboutery went off the scale, with football writers discovering that, unless they openly criticise everything that is wrong in sport, they are apparently precluded from criticising anything that is wrong. What about the Saudi Grand Prix? What about the Joshua fight in Riyadh? What about Saudi investment in Manchester United? What about Chelsea? What about Manchester City? What about what about what about? The more reasoned arguments came from Newcastle supporters who felt under attack and on the back foot despite having no say whatsoever in who owns their club. Unlike the army of useful idiots PIF seem to have acquired as part of their purchase agreement, these fans made the entirely reasonable point that it ought to be acceptable for them to cheer on a team they have followed all their lives without feeling compelled to wave pom‑poms on behalf of the regime that owns it. Installed as the replacement for Steve Bruce, Eddie Howe has pointedly refused to answer any awkward questions about his new employers, peddling his “I am but a humble football coach” line whenever they are posed. While nobody expects him to thrash those who pay his wages, as the sole club spokesman who is, fairly or unfairly, shoved weekly in front of a hail of interrogatory projectiles, he could perhaps learn a thing or two from his Chelsea counterpart, Thomas Tuchel, who seems far more accomplished at answering such queries. Then again, as a former PSG manager, the German has had more practice. On the field, Howe has had an easier time of it after a shaky start. Through a combination of lavish January spending and his skill at revitalising players who had been hideously underperforming under his predecessor, he has put distance between his side and the relegation mire. Even after three consecutive defeats, the most recent a hiding by Tottenham, they still look safe. For all their incandescent rage at their club’s detractors, Newcastle fans have never seemed happier as they dance and sing along to the tune Howe is getting from his side.",Sport/Football,"Six months in, Newcastle takeover still offers little cause for celebration | Barry Glendenning",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/04/six-months-in-newcastle-takeover-still-offers-little-cause-for-celebration
4/4/2022,"With students now back at school and many workplaces moving to at least a hybrid model of working from the office and at home, it’s not surprising that more of us are getting Covid, or hearing of people in our social circles who have it. But why is it that in some cases, one member of a household tests positive for Covid, while other people living with them return negative tests, even though they also develop some symptoms? Guardian Australia spoke to the director of public health pathology at New South Wales Health Pathology, Prof Dominic Dwyer, about why so many people are reporting living with a Covid-positive person and developing symptoms, but testing negative for Covid. Dwyer says just because somebody in your home has Covid, “it doesn’t mean that everyone else is going to get it by any means”. For the Omicron variant which is dominant in Australia, about 40% of household members will pick up the virus if there is a Covid case in the home, he said. “Obviously household studies need to be interpreted carefully, because in some homes everyone has their own bedroom and there is a large back yard and open space, whereas in other households a number of people live in a smaller apartment. But in general terms Omicron is more contagious within a household than other variants, but that doesn’t mean you will definitely get it.” Rapid antigen tests are generally most accurate when performed within the first seven days from when symptoms first appear. Most people now use rapid antigen tests because they are more accessible and convenient for many people. But Dwyer said they “miss at least 30% of cases”. “The PCR test is much more accurate, but even that will still miss some cases, depending on how long people have had symptoms,” he said. PCR tests are best at detecting the virus within the first 10 days of developing symptoms, with earlier testing increasing the likelihood of detection. PCR test accuracy is upwards of 90%, however, the efficacy of Covid-19 tests is still being reviewed and can depend on factors such as whether the test was administered correctly, and in the case of PCR tests, how soon after the swab was taken the sample was analysed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It also appears that in people with low viral loads – that is, the virus has not replicated as dramatically in their body so they have fewer virus particles – PCR tests can give a false negative result. People who are vaccinated are much more likely to produce low viral loads and milder symptoms if infected. “Sometimes, a confirmed Covid case in a household prompts everyone to get tested, and those other people may have cleared the virus from their system already even if they have some mild symptoms,” Dwyer said. “So testing can be complicated. Overall, RAT tests are good, the PCR tests are better, but we’ll miss a small percentage of cases even with PCR tests.” We are entering the colder months and already, pathologists and hospitals are seeing more of other respiratory viruses circulating including influenza, Dwyer says, especially with international borders open again. It is plausible that someone in a household may have Covid, while the symptoms experienced by someone else in the same household is caused by a different pathogen, such as rhinoviruses. Either way, close contacts of a Covid case need to isolate for seven days from the first household contact testing positive. You do not need to repeat self-isolation if another person in your household tests positive during your seven days self-isolation, or in the 14 days after your isolation period ends. Rules around what is considered a close contact changes between the states and territories, as do isolation guidelines, so it is best to check your state or territory health department website for the latest advice. Dwyer said while sick people may be concerned about ensuring their diagnosis is accurate if they are living or working with vulnerable people, such as the immunocompromised or elderly, it is a good idea to isolate and stay home from work and away from others no matter what the cause of the cold or virus is. “An accurate diagnosis can be important, especially for someone with severe influenza where there might be specific treatments like antivirals that can be given,” Dwyer said. “But people with concerning symptoms would likely go to their doctor and receive a test for that and further treatment anyway.”",News/Australia news,"Everyone around you has Covid, and you have symptoms – so why are you testing negative?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/everyone-around-you-has-covid-so-why-are-you-testing-negative-when-you-have-symptoms
4/4/2022,"The Morrison government has launched a third attempt to change the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) to allow it to fund a broader range of technologies, including some using fossil fuels. The Senate has twice in the past year used a disallowance motion to block new regulations introduced by the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, to expand Arena’s remit to include backing technologies such as hydrogen made with gas and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The most recent disallowance motion passed last Monday. It was moved by the outgoing Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells in her role as the chair of the standing committee for the scrutiny of delegated legislation. Fierravanti-Wells told the Senate the expansion of Arena’s remit was not consistent with what the parliament envisaged when it passed the laws creating the renewable energy agency. Labor, Greens and some crossbenchers opposed the expansion on the grounds a renewable energy agency should not fund fossil fuel developments. On Friday, with parliament having risen until after the upcoming election, Taylor released a new set of regulations to govern Arena. It will apply unless blocked by the Senate of the next parliament. Senate estimates heard on Monday that the new regulations would allow Arena to fund a larger range of technologies than the version disallowed last week. That version was explicitly tied to priority areas under the Coalition’s low-emissions technology roadmap. The latest version says Arena will be able to fund clean energy technologies as defined by the board of a separate government agency, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). This created some confusion as CEFC, which is sometimes described as the national “green bank”, is banned from funding CCS and nuclear projects. Estimates heard Arena would not be subject to the same ban. Officials said nuclear power faced other prohibitions, but the new regulations could allow Arena to fund developments that use CCS such as the development of “blue” hydrogen made with gas. They could also let the agency back low-emissions transport, cement, steel and aluminium developments and carbon capture and utilisation projects. Through a spokesperson, Taylor said the government was committed to ensuring its agencies could “support the full range of technologies that will reduce emissions”. “These changes are supported by a broad cross section of peak bodies and industry groups,” the spokesperson said. “In this term of parliament, Labor has joined with the Greens to oppose more funding for these agencies and a broader technology mandate. They’ve gone against the advice of expert bodies like the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who call for an ‘all of the above’ approach to reducing emissions.” Labor’s climate change and energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, criticised Taylor’s attempt to redraw the new regulations. “The only thing that will stop this bloke’s attacks on cheaper and cleaner energy is a change of government,” he said. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the new regulation was a blatant attempt to “undermine the renewable energy agency”. “These regulations won’t last,” he said. “Sneakily acting after parliament has risen might buy the Liberals a few weeks, but we’ve defeated them before and – after we kick the Liberals out at the election – we will defeat them again.” Estimates heard Arena could already fund a range of technologies beyond solar and wind power before the change. They included bioenergy, battery storage, hydro power, pumped hydro, demand storage, green hydrogen made using renewable energy, geothermal and ocean energy. Referring to previously proposed regulations, industry group the Smart Energy Council has previously said it would launch legal action to challenge the broadening of Arena’s remit if it was not disallowed in the Senate.",News/Australia news,Coalition tries for third time to let renewable energy agency fund technologies using fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/coalition-tries-for-third-time-to-let-renewable-energy-agency-fund-technologies-using-fossil-fuels
4/4/2022,"It’s the merciful end of another awards season, filled with bitterness, backlashes and backhanders, which obviously means that, yes, it’s the start of the next one! While frontrunners for each of the main categories might have shifted throughout the season, the last few months solidified the favourites who then proceeded to take home awards at last week’s Oscars ceremony. This time last year, it was arguably just Will Smith and Jane Campion who seemed like early contenders, so with enough grains of salt to fill the Dolby Theatre, here’s a risky, “don’t quote me on this” set of guesses for next year’s ceremony: It’s admittedly not much of a big bet to predict that Steven Spielberg’s name will be a major part of awards season, the director having won three Oscars while being nominated for 16 others, but after coming home empty-handed this weekend, next year could well see him crowned once again. Following the fruitful route of Alfonso Cuarón and, most recently, Kenneth Branagh, The Fabelmans will see the director delving into his youth for a semi-autobiographical family drama, an unusually small film for a director more associated with a far grander scale. Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen will play parents while the script, co-written by Spielberg (his first credit as writer since 2001’s AI) and Tony Kushner, has been called “very revealing” by the not often revealed director’s longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamiński. Two years after she terrified men who really should be more terrified in midnight-movie-turned-Oscar-contender Promising Young Woman, Carey Mulligan may well be returning to the race with another #MeToo-era tale. The two-time nominee (who was first up for best actress for 2009’s An Education) is taking on the role of the New York Times journalist Megan Twohey in She Said, an adaptation of the bestselling book co-written by Twohey and Jodi Kantor (played by Zoe Kazan). It details how the pair worked to take down Harvey Weinstein with innumerable stories of his sexual misconduct. Directed by Unorthodox’s Maria Schrader, who won an Emmy for helming the acclaimed Netflix series, and also starring nominees Patricia Clarkson and Samantha Morton, it’s one of the most Oscar-friendly projects of the season. This year may have seen an unusual dearth of examples (SAG nominee Jennifer Hudson just missed out for playing Aretha Franklin), but music biopic lead has historically been one of the easiest ways to score an Oscar nomination. Next year’s most likely pick is the British actor Naomi Ackie, best known for The End of the F***ing World, who nabbed the in-demand role of Whitney Houston in I Wanna Dance with Somebody. Houston’s untouchable vocals will be used but Ackie will take the singer through the many highs and lows in what’s been called a “no holds barred” drama by producer Clive Davis, who discovered Houston in her teens. Director Kasi Lemmons last ushered her Harriet star Cynthia Erivo to a best actress nod in 2020. Even in his heyday, Brendan Fraser never had quite the run he’s about to have, a comeback so perfectly crafted, it’ll be the envy of every other faded star looking for a career reboot. After a small role in Steven Soderbergh’s mob drama No Sudden Move last year, the next 12 months will see him star alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese’s fact-based thriller Killers of the Flower Moon, remind us of his knack for comedy alongside Josh Brolin, Peter Dinklage and Glenn Close in Brothers, play the key villain in DC’s Batgirl movie and, most excitingly, lead The Whale, the highly anticipated new film from Darren Aronofsky. The director previously managed a successful rehaul of Mickey Rourke in 2008’s The Wrestler, securing him and co-star Marisa Tomei Oscar nominations, and is now hoping to do the same with his adaptation of the acclaimed play, that sees Fraser playing a 600lb gay man trying to reconnect with his daughter. Breaking out with the horror hit Hereditary before securing his status as Next Big Thing with the expectation-upending melodrama of Midsommar, a film that a bolder Academy would surely have rewarded, the new film from Ari Aster carries with it a rare sense of curious excitement. Oscar recognition feels easily within reach and maybe his next film, “nightmare comedy” Disappointment Blvd, could be the one. It stars Oscar-winner Joaquin Phoenix as “one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time” in an ambitious decades-spanning faux-biopic also starring Patti LuPone, Amy Ryan and Parker Posey. Little is known other than it will be four hours long and that reportedly, Aster and Phoenix had a tumultuous relationship on-set. Someone else who’s also felt on the verge of Academy approval for a few years now is Kelvin Harrison Jr, a prolific and preternaturally talented actor who’s quickly established himself as one of the best of his generation. While he has been charming, and musically adept, in Cyrano and The High Note, he has also confronted darker and knottier material in Luce and Waves and this next year sees him starring in two Oscar-friendly movies, one of which could net him his first nomination. His role as BB King in Baz Luhrmann’s extravagant Elvis biopic might be too small to register but he’s the lead in Searchlight’s Chevalier, playing Chevalier de Saint-Georges, the French-Caribbean music prodigy who fell from the top to the bottom of French high society after falling out of favour with Marie Antoinette. Stefani Robinson, award-winning writer on Atlanta, has written the script, suggesting this won’t be some stuffy period drama. After Apple TV+ became the first streaming company to win the Oscar for best picture with Coda (much to the chagrin of A for effort Netflix), the tech giant will be aiming for more next season with Martin Scorsese’s $200m 20s-set crime drama Killers of the Flower Moon. Originally housed at Paramount before being shopped to streamers when execs balked at the budget, the adaptation of David Grann’s bestselling book about the mysterious murders of Indigenous people has an impressive top-line cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons. But the Native American actor Lily Gladstone could end up stealing the film from under them, having already impressed in Certain Women and First Cow, and could become the first ever Indigenous person to win a non-honorary acting Oscar. After winning the best actress Oscar for La La Land, Emma Stone managed to avoid the Oscarbait curse, refusing to make the obvious and earnest choices as others have done once they’ve had a taste, working with Cary Fukunaga on the leftfield Netflix series Maniac and Yorgos Lanthimos for smutty and strange period comedy The Favourite. The latter did in fact nab her a nomination and she’s now re-teaming with the director, and the film’s screenwriter Tony McNamara, for an adaptation of Alasdair Gray’s Poor Things. It’s a perverse, Victorian-set spin on Frankenstein with Stone playing a woman brought back to life by a scientist using the brain of her unborn child and she stars alongside Ramy Youssef, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe and Jerrod Carmichael. The acclaimed onetime actor has now fully transitioned into life as an acclaimed director, having ushered Julie Christie to a best actress nomination with Away From Her (and picking up a screenplay nod in the process) and picking up plaudits for the doc Stories We Tell and relationship drama Take This Waltz. Her latest is an adaptation of Miriam Toews’s novel Women Talking, following a group of women living in an isolated Mennonite colony who come together when they find out the men have all been sexually assaulting them. It’s one of many #MeToo-themed films heading our way and with Brad Pitt’s Plan B producing (the same company that led Moonlight, Departed and 12 Years A Slave to best picture) and a cast including Frances McDormand, Jessie Buckley, Rooney Mara, Claire Foy and Ben Whishaw, expect it to be a mainstay of the season. While all of the above are guesses at best, predicting a nomination for Emma Thompson is based on a sight seen sure thing, the wonderful Sundance two-hander Good Luck to You, Leo Grande. The much-loved multi-hyphenate (who has won Oscars for both writing and acting), is already a safe bet for a best actress nod, if not win, for her show-stopping performance as a retired schoolteacher who hires a sex worker to educate her on how to achieve an orgasm. It’s a small, somewhat stagey one-location film (other nominations, bar perhaps an original screenplay nod, might be a stretch) but Thompson is arguably the best she’s ever been and with the Academy already on her side, it feels like the closest we have to a dead cert at this stage.",Arts/Film,Oscars 2023: who might be in the running at next year’s ceremony?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/04/oscars-2023-who-might-be-in-the-running-at-next-years-ceremony
4/4/2022,"Callers to the Measure 110 hotline, which was set up a year ago, after Oregon became the first state in the US to decriminalise personal possession of drugs including meth and heroin, may hear Martin Lewis Lockett’s deep, reassuring voice. Lockett, who is in recovery, first assesses the callers, who can use the hotline if they have received a police citation for drug use. He uses an evidence-based screening tool to determine if someone has substance use issues, and connects them with nearby help. In one case, a man called the hotline after relapsing, but told Lockett his drug use was just a hiccup. “I know minimisation when I hear it,” Lockett said. By the end of the call, the man realised he needed help, and Lockett linked him to services. But Lockett says the hotline isn’t as busy as he hoped. “We just don’t get a lot of traffic on that line,” Lockett said. Not enough people are calling for help, and even when they do Lockett said it’s tricky to find detox and residential treatment beds. Many can wait weeks. The hotline is one of the central elements of Oregon’s bold decision, one year ago, to decriminalise drugs. In November 2020 the state’s residents voted to pass Ballot Measure 110, which, inspired by Portugal’s decriminalisation 20 years before, recognised substance use disorder as a health issue and halted the incarceration of drug users. Anyone in Oregon now caught with small amounts of drugs – including meth, heroin, LSD and cocaine – receives a ticket for $45 to $100, and a card with the number of a hotline. If they call the hotline, they can complete a substance use disorder screening to get their ticket waived. The hotline, staffed by counsellors like Lockett who are themselves in recovery, also aims to connect people with help if they need it. Advocates and lawmakers are now pushing for similar bills and measures in six more states. One year in, there have been some successes. There is new funding for harm reduction, which the evidence suggests has saved lives, and police are no longer arresting people for carrying small quantities, meaning they will not face incarceration or blemishes on their records, which can prevent them from finding housing and employment. At the same time, however, substance use is rising in Oregon. It ranks second in the US for substance use disorder, according to a December 2021 analysis, and 50th out of 50 states – dead last – for the percentage of teens and adults needing but not receiving treatment for substance use disorder. Across the US, overdose deaths are increasing – and the same is true in Oregon, where medical examiner data showed drug toxicity deaths continued to inch up in 2021. Experts say decriminalisation is not the problem. What the new measure lacks, they say, is a proper pathway to recovery amid the growing overdose crisis. Before Measure 110, personal possession carried a misdemeanour charge, punishable by up to a year in jail and thousands in fines. Those who were eligible could choose between the traditional criminal system or drug courts, which give judges the power to order treatment, require drug testing and impose punishment or incentives. But Measure 110 allows people caught with small amounts of drugs to avoid the criminal justice system, meaning those people instead are routed to the hotline via the citations. These were meant to be a “golden ticket” to health assessments and services, explained Mike Marshall, executive director of Oregon Recovers. Instead, of the 1,885 people who received tickets for personal possession in the first year, only 91 called the hotline, according to its non-profit operator, Lines For Life. “Virtually no one is calling the hotline, so that referral process is a failure,” Marshall said. He believes Oregon should have followed Portugal by creating an effective pathway to help before decriminalising drugs. “We did the complete opposite: we decriminalised and stopped intervening in people’s drug use through the criminal justice system, but then are still deciding on funding for that alternative pathway,” he said. “That’s not the way to go.” In contrast to Oregon’s citation method, under Portugal’s system, people caught with small amounts of drugs are sent to local “dissuasion commissions” that assess whether they have substance use disorder, and can refer them to treatment, impose fines or require community service. “At least through the criminal justice system, someone had a pathway to recovery, as flawed as that was, and as stigmatising as that was,” he continued. “There’s a whole bunch of people who are no longer given a pathway to recovery if they choose it.” Even for those people who do call, finding detox and residential treatment beds is difficult because the services are historically underresourced – and the pandemic just made the situation worse, according to data provided by the Oregon Council for Behavioural Health. Measure 110 did nothing to change any of that. People aren’t calling because there are no consequences for ignoring the ticket, explains Dwight Holton, CEO of Lines For Life. He urged states looking to copy Oregon to consider whether they already have effective pathways to connect people to help. “The most important thing that people who are looking at us can learn is that it’s imperative to build better connections to recovery – the sooner the better,” he said. “We’re playing catch-up.” Some are defending the decision to decriminalise drugs without first firming up a pathway to recovery. Immediate decriminalisation was necessary to decrease stigma and prevent thousands of arrests each year, especially in communities of colour, said Tera Hurst, executive director of Health Justice Recovery Alliance. While she conceded the citations were not the best intervention, she argued coercing people into treatment through drug courts undermines their dignity and autonomy, and noted that opioid users face high risk of overdose when they are first released from jail. “I don’t think we have time to do this in a slow and steady way as some people suggest. In theory that’s fine, but in reality, we don’t invest in things until we have to. Decriminalisation created a space where we have to start investing in these services,” Hurst said. Measure 110 did create a new funding stream, doling out $30m in grants in its first year for harm reduction, housing and employment assistance, peer support and clinical assessments. That money helped more than 16,000 people. Max’s Mission, a non-profit in southern Oregon, received $215,000 of that money which it used to buy naloxone, which reversed 111 overdoses. Another $270m will be distributed this spring to create a Behavioural Health Resource Network – entities in each county that assess drug users’ needs, create intervention plans and link them to care. (The grants have faced delays due to internal conflict between members of the Measure 110 Oversight and Accountability Council, which is responsible for handing out the money.) Heather Jefferis, executive director of the Oregon Council for Behavioural Health, said the next stage of Measure 110 will fund a “robust continuum of care” for people with substance use disorder. “Oregon has never had that,” she said. She believes it’s too soon to cast doubt on Measure 110. After the grant funds are handed out, she looks forward to data on what new services became available, how many people are referred to services, and other numbers that will show if Measure 110 is having an impact. Back at the hotline, Lockett thinks Measure 110 will succeed after the Behavioural Health Resource Network is in place. Each county’s network is required to have a hotline, and some will partner with Lines for Life, making their hotline busier. “If the goal is to reduce the amount of people using drugs … then it’s going to take a concerted effort by all of us, clinicians, police officers, county behavioural health systems – across the board it’s got to be a concerted effort,” he said. “Anything as large scale as this for Oregon, it’s gonna take time. But there’s certainly hope on the horizon.”",News/US news,Oregon’s bold drug decriminalisation sees some success – but use still rising,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/04/oregon-drugs-decriminalisation-ballot-measure-110
4/4/2022,"Q My fiancee and I have recently sold our shared-ownership flat under an increasingly popular process known as back-to-back or simultaneous staircasing. We owned 40% but decided, with a view to making the flat more marketable, we would sell 100% – by effectively acquiring the remaining 60% and selling the entire 100% to the buyer in parallel transactions.We were told by our solicitor that stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was payable on the back-to-back staircasing. This meant that SDLT was paid twice on the sale of the flat, and we had to pay SDLT again on our new property. A very costly exercise.Several of our ex-neighbours are also selling their flats, and have been told by different solicitors that SDLT is not payable on such back-to-back staircasing. As with our solicitor, their solicitors cite confirmation received directly from HM Revenue and Customs and external counsel.It appears this is a grey area, which HMRC hasn’t addressed, and is largely related to the applicability (or otherwise) of subsale relief. Any help would be much appreciated, as if indeed SDLT was not payable, we have paid £4,000 unnecessarily simply because our solicitor adopted a more conservative position than many others in the market.JP A I don’t think that you ended up paying SDLT on your staircasing because of your solicitor’s conservative position. I think it’s more to do with how you chose to pay SDLT when you acquired your 40% share in the flat. According to HMRC guidance, when you buy a property through a shared-ownership scheme run by an “approved public body” you can choose to pay SDLT on the market value of the property or pay SDLT in stages. If you choose market value, you make a one-off payment and there’s no more SDLT to pay even if you later increase your share. However, if you choose to pay in stages – as I suspect that you and your fiancee did – you initially pay SDLT on the “lease premium” (which is the price you paid for the lease). But there’s more SDLT to pay once you acquire a bigger share (using the staircasing process) and your total share in the property is more than 80%. You will find a detailed explanation of how the SDLT is worked out in the HMRC guidance. If you are a first-time buyer buying a shared-ownership property with a market value of £500,000 or less, you qualify for first-time buyer relief, which means that SDLT is charged at 0% on the first £300,000 and 5% on the remainder up to £500,000. This makes paying SDLT on the market value of a shared-ownership property a more attractive proposition than paying it in stages.  Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

4/4/2022,"They survived intact for 112m years through scorching summer heat and freezing winters at Utah’s Mill Canyon. But several of the world’s most important and historic dinosaur footprints were damaged beyond repair earlier this year when a construction crew arrived to build a new boardwalk for tourists. The extent of the harm to the footprints – and those of an ancient crocodile crossing in the canyon near Moab – was detailed in a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) report into the January incident published last week. According to the bureau, the good news was that the damage was evaluated as minor, and would have been much worse if local residents had not spotted tire tracks from heavy machinery on the ground, resulting in the boardwalk project being immediately halted. But fractures to the rims of several of the delicate prints cannot be repaired at the Mill Canyon dinosaur track site, where at least 10 species of dinosaur are known to have left more than 200 individual tracks dating to the early cretaceous period. Future freeze-thaw cycles could also cause the cracks to widen, the BLM warns. According to the report, the damage was caused by both foot traffic and construction equipment as a contractor used a digger to remove the old boardwalk at the site’s most popular area, seeking to replace it with a new, raised platform from which the public could view the tracks. “As a result, trace fossils were damaged,” the report, authored by BLM paleontologist Brent Breithaupt, states. “Unfortunately [one] trace was repeatedly driven over, as recent tire tracks indicate that this area was impacted by the backhoe and other vehicles.” All the areas where damage occurred, Breithaupt noted, “should have been flagged for avoidance and construction crews should have avoided driving vehicles in the area”. The boardwalk replacement project is now on hold until at least the summer as the bureau assesses how to avoid further damage. “To ensure this does not happen again, we will follow the recommendations in the assessment, seek public input, and work with the paleontology community as we collectively move forward on constructing boardwalks at the interpretive site,” the bureau said in a statement. The irreparable damage, however, angered environmentalists. “I’m absolutely outraged that the BLM has apparently destroyed one of the world’s most important paleontological resources,” Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the center for biological diversity, said in a statement when the incident occurred. “This careless disregard for these irreplaceable traces of the past is appalling. It really calls into question the bureau’s competence as a land-management agency.”",News/Science,112m-year-old dinosaur tracks damaged in Utah by construction machinery,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/04/112m-year-old-dinosaur-tracks-damaged-in-utah-by-construction-machinery
4/4/2022,"Garmin’s latest luxury sports watch is a departure for the firm, which has swapped its usual low-power LCD for a fancy OLED screen, sacrificing battery life in the process. It better competes with the Apple Watch and its ilk, but are the trade-offs really worth it for an adventure-tracking smartwatch? The Epix (gen 2) is a new line of expensive all-singing, all-dancing watches from Garmin costing from £799.99 ($899.99/A$1,399). They are built on the company’s Fenix 7 – the benchmark for these types of smartwatches – sharing its design, sensors, software and comprehensive navigation, sport and activity-tracking features. The new watch comes in a single 47mm size with a 22mm-wide strap, but is available in a choice of colours and materials. It is certainly a big watch, but one that is comfortable to wear all day and night on my 50mm-wide wrist and will just fit under shirt cuffs. It has the same great combination of touchscreen and buttons as the Fenix 7, but the difference in the screens is night and day: the OLED display is so much brighter, sharper, smoother and backlit all the time. The quality of the screen is a giant upgrade, making the watch face more colourful with finer elements and crisper details. In common with OLED screens from competitors, to save battery the display dims but does not turn off completely when not actively being used and brightens when it detects it is being rotated towards you or touched. Screen: 1.3in AMOLED (416x416 pixels) Case size: 47mm Case thickness: 14.5mm Band size: standard 22mm quick release Weight: 47 or 53g body only Storage: 16 or 32GB Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: GNSS (GPS, Glonass, Galileo, BeiDuo, QZSS), compass, thermometer, HR, pulse Ox Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+, wifi For indoor or night activities, such as circuits, gym workouts or evening runs, the OLED screen is easy to read because it is lit all the time, so doesn’t require a backlight to be turned on like you might on an LCD. The screen is high-contrast and bright enough that on a sunny winter’s day in Britain it was fairly easy to read while running. It should be clear enough for most activities, but it will be harder to see in direct sunlight than the transflective LCD Garmins usually have, which becomes clearer the brighter the sun is. The Epix has the same general health and advanced activity monitoring features as the Fenix 7, including offline maps and music, sleep, stress and recovery tracking, all-day heart rate and many others. It will track practically everything and has Garmin’s latest stamina-monitoring and improved GNSS location technology with “multi band GPS”. For more information, see the Fenix 7 review. The watch connects to your phone via Bluetooth for basic message alerts, music control and data syncing, but can also sync directly to your Garmin account via built-in wifi or with a PC or Mac via the included USB cable. It has Garmin Pay for contactless purchases but UK bank support is limited. The OLED screen has a big impact on battery life. The Epix still lasts a long time for a smartwatch. The Apple Watch and similar competitors rarely last longer than 36 hours between charges, while the Epix manages just under six days and nights including about three hours of running, walking and other activity tracking. But that is far behind the 15-plus days and nights of the Fenix 7 under the same conditions. The Epix will last up to 15 hours of running with the highest accuracy GNSS setting or up to 30 hours with just GPS enabled – long enough for a marathon or two, but eight and 27 hours short of the Fenix 7 respectively. The Epix is generally repairable and replacement straps, cables and accessories are readily available. The battery is rated to last a few years of frequent charge cycles while maintaining at least 80-90% capacity and can be replaced through service. New watches do not contain recycled materials, but reconditioned products sold by Garmin may do. Garmin offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling laws. The Garmin Epix (gen 2) costs £799.99 ($899.99/A$1,399) in steel or £899.99 ($999.99/A$1,499) in titanium with a sapphire screen. For comparison, the Fenix 7 starts at £599.99, the Venu 2 starts at £349.99, the Apple Watch Series 7 starts at £369 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 starts at £249. It is difficult to figure out who the Epix is really for. The Fenix 7 is the benchmark of adventure watches because not only is it capable of going anywhere and tracking anything, its battery also lasts a very long time. The Epix has the first bit but not the second. There are benefits to having an OLED screen, particularly the way this expensive watch looks, and it still lasts 5-6 days between charges, but the knock on battery life compared to Garmin’s LCD-based versions is considerable. The biggest problem for me is that having a good-looking screen sets certain expectations for the smartwatch features that the Garmin can’t quite fulfil. There’s no mic for a voice assistant or calls. Message alerts are basic and you can’t reply to them at all when used with an iPhone. Only very few, extremely limited third-party apps are available and even getting to basic features such as timers and alarms is clunky compared to an Apple or Samsung watch. But these limitations are shared by most Garmins, which hasn’t made them any less popular. If you want a luxury sports watch with a fancy screen that is less about smart features and more about being a tool for adventures, the Epix delivers. But for most people the Fenix 7 or cheaper smartwatch competitors are probably a better buy. Pros: tracks everything under the sun, 5+ day battery, cross-platform basic phone notifications, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, Bluetooth, wifi, 100m water resistance, real buttons, accurate GPS/GNSS, choice of materials. Cons: expensive, big, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple Watch/Galaxy Watch, no voice control, bettered on battery by Fenix 7.

4/4/2022,"While I was obtaining a home insurance quotation of £183 from Sainsbury’s Bank, my husband reminded me that we have a Nectar card, so I went back to the online form and added its number. I was very surprised to see that the price rose as a result – to £194. When I deleted the card from the order, the price reverted to £183. This seems like a very odd way to treat loyal customers. Had I remembered to enter the card number in the first place, I would have assumed that this was the best price. I’d never have thought of deleting it to reduce the premium. You wonder how many others may have overpaid as a result of this. SP, Hitchin I have long felt that life is too short for Nectar and other reward schemes, but have never thought that people could be being charged more to use them. Sainsbury’s Bank has blamed a technical error for your experience. It has apologised and provided a £10 Nectar credit as a gesture of goodwill. Its explanation is that the system recognised that a Nectar card was registered to your address, and that it had automatically applied the “Nectar preferential rate”. The act of you adding the number should not have changed the quoted price, it says, and claims it is not aware of this happening to other customers. This week I went online and did a home insurance quote with Sainsbury’s Bank and the price barely changed when I added my wife’s Nectar card. Has anyone else noticed this happening? Perhaps readers should get two quotes – one with their loyalty card added, and one without. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
