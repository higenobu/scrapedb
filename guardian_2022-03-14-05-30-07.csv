3/14/2022,"The most bizarre of tournaments continues to deliver madcap moments. As debate rages about the fairness or otherwise of the 17th at Sawgrass, it seems safe to assume Rory McIlroy will sing the hole’s praises. McIlroy was homeward bound on account of what would have been a sixth missed cut in a dozen Players Championship starts when Peter Malnati, having thinned his approach shot, miraculously saved par at the 18th. Those at plus two, including McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler, were out. Enter Scott Piercy. At two under par striding towards the 17th tee, Piercy did not form part of any cut conversation. How that was to change; two balls fired into the pond contributed to a quadruple bogey seven, bringing McIlroy and co to the magical position of tied 65th. Piercy bogeyed the last for good measure. McIlroy, who produced back-to-back 73s from what was unquestionably the tougher side of the draw in this disrupted event, has been afforded a further two rounds to at least ramp up preparations for next month’s Masters. With a Monday evening finish certain after inclement weather seriously delayed play on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, the leading players were not able to complete their third rounds on Sunday. The Irishman Séamus Power summed up the messy scene. “We played a hole and a half on Thursday, 12 holes on Friday and then 20 on Saturday,” he said. After 36 holes, Sam Burns and Tom Hoge shared the lead at seven under par. Harold Varner joined Erik van Rooyen at minus six, one clear of a sextet that included Tommy Fleetwood and Paul Casey. “I know I got the lucky side of the draw,” Casey admitted. “I’m very aware of that and it’s been interesting watching the guys battle on the other side. I believe in the golfing gods and karma, so I don’t sit there gleefully watching it. “I think like I’ve got lucky that a few guys have been spat out just because of the draw and that makes it a little easier to look at in terms of people I’ve got to beat. We’ll see.” Fleetwood was similarly pragmatic. “I have had my fair share of bad draws,” he said. “I’ve probably had my fair share of good ones but you never remember those, you just complain about the bad ones.” Those who failed to survive for rounds three and four included Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Justin Rose and Xander Schauffele.",Sport/Sport,Rory McIlroy gets reprieve at Players Championship as Piercy crumbles,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/rory-mcilroy-gets-reprieve-at-players-championship-as-piercy-crumbles
3/14/2022,"Barack Obama has tested positive for Covid-19. “I just tested positive for Covid,” the former president, 60, said in a tweet on Sunday. “I’ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise. Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. It’s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, even as cases go down.” Falling case rates in the US have triggered the relaxation of most public health measures imposed by cities, states and the federal government. According to Johns Hopkins University, however, the US death toll from the two-year coronavirus pandemic stood on Sunday at a little over 967,000, from nearly 79.5m cases. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 77% of eligible Americans have received at least one vaccination shot. The fully vaccinated figure is 65% and 44% have had a booster shot. Resistance to vaccination and other public health measures against Covid is higher in Republican-run states. The Obamas have homes in Washington DC, Massachusetts and Hawaii, all with more than 70% of the eligible population considered fully protected. Last August, however, Obama was forced to drastically scale back a 60th birthday party he planned to host on Martha’s Vineyard, an exclusive island off Massachusetts, amid criticism for planning a large social event at a time of surging cases.",News/US news,Barack Obama announces positive test for Covid-19,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/barack-obama-positive-test-covid-19
3/14/2022,"Long before Covid-19 made briefings by state premiers must-watch daily news events, I had wanted to find a way to expand Guardian Australia’s coverage of the states. State governments control many of the services at the centre of readers’ lives: schools, hospitals, roads, police, environmental approvals and emergency services. Many of the tax, planning and social housing policies that may ease the housing crisis are in the hands of the states. And of course the pandemic highlighted the fact that it’s the premiers who have the power to lock down our cities or close domestic borders. As we have seen with energy generation, when states don’t like a federal government’s policy positioning, they can find ways to work around it. And as has been all too evident in the responses to the east coast flooding these past few weeks, part of the problem with slow and inadequate government response to global heating-driven natural disasters is the complex delineation of responsibilities between the federal government and the states. All of this means we obviously need to look at the federation through the lens of both Canberra and the states, to properly understand how it functions, or, in some cases, doesn’t. But space on the homepage of a news website is as restricted as on the front page of a newspaper. A story that dominates state news may fall much further down a national news list. The solution we have found is the state-based containers we are launching today. These are sections of the news site for state stories – initially in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria – visible only to readers in the relevant state (although readers can select news from another state if they prefer). A big state story will still lead our site, but the state containers will allow us to follow it for longer, and to make sure we have covered the most important stories in that state, even when they don’t dominate the national news, or when other national events may supersede them. We won’t have the volume of coverage of the big state mastheads, but guided by Guardian Australia’s news values and priorities, the new state editors and reporters will offer readers a fresh perspective on their state. Being national, but with state-focused teams, we will aim to knit state and federal news together so our audience gets a fuller picture. I hope this three-state trial, funded by the Google News Initiative, will pave the way for Guardian Australia to set up bureaus in other states. Most of all, I want our readers to receive the most comprehensive and relevant news we can provide.

3/14/2022,"The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will get married in Belmarsh prison on 23 March, with just four guests allowed to attend. Vivienne Westwood is designing a wedding dress for the 50-year-old’s fiancee, the lawyer Stella Moris, and a kilt for Assange, whose parents have links to Scotland. The designer has been a staunch supporter of Assange. Moris, who met Assange when he was living in London’s Ecuadorian embassy seeking political asylum, will marry the WikiLeaks founder in the high-security jail nearly three years after his arrest. The couple have two children. Moris, who spoke to her fiance on Sunday, told the PA news agency they were both “very excited” despite restrictions on the ceremony. She said they were waiting to hear if they are permitted a photographer, and that guests would have to leave immediately afterwards, despite the marriage taking place during normal visiting hours. “Obviously we are very excited, even though the circumstances are very restrictive,” she said. “There continues to be unjustified interference in our plans. Having a photographer for an hour is not an unreasonable request.” Two witnesses will also be allowed, along with two security guards. “Julian is looking forward to the wedding because it is finally happening, many months after we first made the request,” Moris added. “He is being held on behalf of a foreign power and has not been charged with anything, which is completely disgraceful.” Assange, an Australian citizen, was arrested after spending more than six years in the Ecuadorian embassy while he fought to avoid extradition to Sweden, after WikiLeaks’ publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In January, he won the first stage of an appeal to fight extradition to the United States, where he faces espionage charges.

3/14/2022,"Good morning. Russia has widened its assault on Ukraine, hitting a military base near Poland, killing at least 35 people. Scott Morrison has left open the possibility of a petrol excise cut in budget. And the Baftas are currently under way with the winners to be announced this morning. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is muscling up for another fight with business and the federal government as he pushes forward with Australia’s first paid sick leave trial. “The notion that we all collectively benefit from people not having any sick pay and having to choose between keeping their family fed or keeping their community safe, they’re not choices people should have to make,” Andrews said. He was unapologetic about the need to raise money to pay for social reform, and clearly prepared to contrast his record with that of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, federally. The Morrison government has been criticised for its “fumbling” response to the floods disaster by dozens of the nation’s top emergency chiefs who say the government was warned in October about the prospect of massive flooding over summer. “The government knew what was coming and it did not adequately prepare our communities or first responders,” New South Wales fire and rescue commissioner Greg Mullins said. Meanwhile, two Queensland mayors have backed calls for the federal government to help underwrite insurance companies against future inundations, so that homeowners aren’t left to cover “catastrophic” financial risks as the climate crisis and a legacy of poor planning coalesce. And helicopter aircrew have shared their experiences rescuing people from snakebites, landslides and rising flood waters. Russia has escalated its war in Ukraine with strikes on a major military base close to the Polish border, killing at least 35 people and injuring 134 more. The attack happened hours after the Kremlin had warned that western supply lines into the embattled country were “legitimate targets”. Ukraine says at least 1,300 of its soldiers have been killed so far during Russia’s invasion, as the country begins to publicly acknowledge its losses. US journalist Brent Renaud was killed by Russian forces in a town outside Kyiv, and the pope has come out to condemn the invasion and called for the “unacceptable armed aggression” to end. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said he is “hungry” for victory, and had learned from the “mistakes” from the Rudd/Gillard era during a 60 Minutes interview. Albanese also predicted the federal election will be on 14 May, and suggested voters were growing tired of Scott Morrison. Farmers are seeking urgent clarity on who owns the ground beneath their properties after allegations that “deviated” drilling by a gas company has occurred beneath multiple properties without notifying landholders. Unionist Linda White is leading the race to replace Victorian Labor senator Kim Carr, after a backroom push in the final weeks before the election. The $30bn plan to build a giant solar farm in northern Australia has moved a step closer with billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest contributing to a $210m capital raising. Iran has claimed responsibility for a missile strike near the US consulate in Iraq, saying it was retaliation for an Israeli strike in Syria that killed two of its revolutionary guards. France will lift most of its Covid restrictions on Monday as the government vows to ease pressure on people’s daily lives despite a rise in infections. Meanwhile, China’s Covid cases doubled yesterday, forcing lockdowns on virus hotspots as the country contends with its gravest outbreak in two years. “Over the years, I think my temperament has become more optimistic,” says Talking Heads frontman David Byrne. “I can, in some ways, convey that to an audience without telling them, without saying, ‘be hopeful,’ I can show them. By what we do on stage, who we are and how we work together, they see evidence that things can be different.” Byrne spoke with Guardian Australia about his new song with Australian musician Montaigne, the bravery of Taylor Swift and leaving Spotify. The public pool, like the corner store or local pub, is a community hub, a rare spot where families, retirees, young couples and teens from different backgrounds and circumstances meet and play. Arising in the most unlikely of places – whether it be the middle of the Pilbra or the edge of the Murray River – the public pool is the holy grail of refreshment on a hot day, a space to gather, gossip and – for many – learn to swim. Caitlin Cassidy is well acquainted with the public pool due to a chronic back injury, and has shared her top picks from around the country. Insomnia doesn’t happen overnight. For Mark Starmach it started with a few bad nights, and soon he was waking every night at 2am, unable to nod back off. “As my eyes popped reliably open at 2am, I felt painfully awake  – heart and mind racing, feet writhing against the bedsheets, wishing and wishing to sleep. Perhaps the hardest thing about insomnia is how isolating it is, how quiet you have to be.” Communities in Queensland and northern NSW are facing the daunting task of cleaning up the damage caused by historic floods earlier this month. Some are angry, others devastated and most are wondering whether government support will be enough to rebuild and recover.

3/14/2022,"The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s slow-burn western starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a ferocious rancher in 1920s Montana, has taken the top two prizes at this year’s Baftas: best film and best director. Cumberbatch accepted the award for director the absence of Campion, who was still in Los Angeles having attended the Directors Guild America awards there on Saturday. Cumberbatch missed out in the leading actor category, losing to Will Smith for his performance as the father of Venus and Serena Williams in King Richard. The win makes Smith a huge favourite to triumph at the Oscars in a fortnight, where Campion is also heavily tipped to win. Reinaldo Marcus Green, the director of King Richard, picked up the prize in place of the actor who, he said, “when he put on those short shorts, was like Superman”. Best actress was awarded to Joanna Scanlan, the veteran Welsh star of stage and small screen for her astonishing performance as a bereaved Muslim convert in Aleem Khan’s debut, After Love. Scanlan gave thanks for Khan as well as her parents, Pat and Mike, and her husband, Neil, “who is living proof there is no such thing as after love”. Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi extravaganza starring Timothée Chalamet, took the most awards of the night – five – sweeping the board in the technical categories including cinematography, production design, visual effects and sound. Kenneth Branagh won outstanding British film for his autobiographical drama, Belfast, and used his speech to thank cinemagoers for heading out to see it. Advances in streaming were admirable, said Branagh, but “all hail the big screen too! It’s alive! And long may they live together!” He continued: “A black-and-white film about the Troubles [was] not an easy pitch, but if you build it they will come”. Film-makers, he said, needed to “believe in the imagination of the public to embrace any and every kind of story, well told”. Sunday night’s event was a confident return to real-life razzmatazz for the Baftas, presented with brio to a receptive, full-capacity crowd at the Albert Hall. An 85-year-old Shirley Bassey opened proceedings with a performance of Diamonds Are Forever to mark 60 years since Dr No, which set the tone for an excitable and ebullient ceremony. There were scant references to the pandemic and only fleeting mentions of the invasion of Ukraine, including a dig at home secretary Priti Patel’s immigrant policy from Andy Serkis, as well as from host Rebel Wilson. Wilson, seen as a bold hire by Bafta following a badly received two-year stint by Joanna Lumley, won her biggest round of applause after she raised a middle finger and explained “in all sign languages, this is the international sign for Putin”. This was blurred out in the pre-watershed TV broadcast, which Wilson had previously vowed would not prevent her from delivering as risque a ceremony as possible. She sailed close to the wind in her opening monologue, expressing a desire to sit on Daniel Craig’s face and drawing a pair of nipples on the 007 logo. Later, Wilson unveiled a cake she had made in the shape of Cumberbatch’s face, the cheekbone of which she then devoured “so I can tell people I had him inside me”. She also made reference to disgraced actor Armie Hammer, the open marriage of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, the lockdown parties at Downing Street and JK Rowling’s contributions on the transgender debate. Prince Andrew’s evening at Pizza Express in Woking also merited a mention, as did Oprah Winfrey’s TV interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the drama and tension of which Wilson praised. Prince William, the president of Bafta, did not attend the ceremony due to “diary constraints” but did make an appearance by video link in which he expressed his pride in Bafta’s mentoring scheme, Breakthrough. Troy Kotsur became the first deaf actor to win a Bafta for his role in family drama Coda, pushing him into pole position at the Oscars. Kotsur is the second ever deaf actor to be nominated for an Academy Award after his Coda co-star Marlee Matlin, who won 35 years ago. The film also took best adapted screenplay. Supporting actress went to Ariana DeBose, whose turn in West Side Story was her screen debut. DeBose paid tribute to the film’s casting director, Cindy Tolan, who earlier in the evening triumphed in her category. Tolan noted that Steven Spielberg’s update of the musical was the first film for 50 members of its cast, selected from some 30,000 hopefuls. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Encanto was named best animation. Speaking on the podium, composer Germaine Franco said she had wanted to make a film that tells “my beautiful brown children they are seen and heard and they’re important”. Paul Thomas Anderson was a surprise winner in the original screenplay category for his coming-of-age comedy drama Licorice Pizza. The film’s star Alana Haim and composer Jonny Greenwood picked up the prize in his absence. Ryusuke Hamaguchi won the award for best film in a foreign language for Drive My Car, his epic road movie based on the Haruki Murakami short story. The film is seen as a successor to the likes of Parasite in moving from acclaim at Cannes, where it took three prizes, to a substantial showing at the Oscars, where it is up for four awards including best picture and best director. It is the first Japanese film up for the former while Hamaguchi is only the country’s third ever director nominated – and the first since Akira Kurosawa in 1985. The awards were decided by the 7,000 members of the British Film Academy, which has undergone a considerable behind-the-scenes overhaul since the backlash to the lack of diversity in its shortlists two years ago. A raft of 220 new rules and regulations were brought in, including quotas for film-makers and the compulsory viewing by voters of at least 15 randomly selected titles in contention. Such measures were credited with this year’s striking wide-ranging set of nominees.",Arts/Film,Baftas 2022: The Power of the Dog wins best picture and director,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/baftas-2022-the-power-of-the-dog-wins-best-picture-and-director
3/14/2022,"Sally Capp was in her mid-20s when she considered leaving Melbourne – a city that, as lord mayor, she’s since led through the world’s longest lockdown – in search of an “interesting life”. It was 1992, and the financial crisis had turned Melbourne into a “moribund city and a rust bucket state” according to Capp, who was then a lawyer for Herbert Geer & Rundle. “I remember walking to the train station one night at 6pm and it was deserted – the city was so quiet,” she says. “I remember thinking, have I got a future here in this city? Am I going to have to move away to pursue my career and have an interesting life? And, thankfully, the answer was no.” Capp points to the Postcode 3000 plan of the early 1990s – credited with transforming the city’s Hoddle Grid from a ghost town into a bustling night-time economy – as being responsible for the era’s huge urban transformation and her decision to stay put. Thirty years later, the lord mayor now finds herself at the helm of Melbourne’s latest transformation project: reviving the city’s arts and culture scene after almost two years of the pandemic. The state government last month scrapped its indoor mask mandate and lifted the work-from-home recommendation. But rebuilding the cultural scene of Melbourne – a city previously acclaimed as being the world’s most liveable and the nation’s live music capital – is a hefty task. The Melbourne city council is investing, with the state government, in subsidised retail spaces to revitalise vacant shopfronts. There’s also an injection of $10m in funds to rejuvenate 40 of the city’s world-famous street-art laneways as drawing points to re-attract visitors and nurture creativity. In the live music scene, there are promising signs of revitalisation. There’s the creation of a new state-wide performance program that saw the Foo Fighters become the first major international act to travel to Australia since the pandemic began. But the state’s smaller band rooms and venues say they remain decimated from two years of the pandemic and are calling for an industry-led elected roundtable to present proposals to government to save the sector. Capp says the council is now stretching its imagination and considering proposals that were previously placed in the “too hard basket” due to cost and logistics – such as expanding outdoor events to include more inner-city street closures, drawing on the pandemic’s trend of reclaiming public spaces. “Overall, it’s about us being more of a city of ‘yes’ to some of those ideas,” she says. “It’s that sense of creativity, it’s the irreverence, it’s the thinking outside the box. It’s a sense of adventure – even misadventure – that the whole creative sector brings to communities, cities and economies that’s so important. So absolutely we’re dedicated to making sure that we remain that cultural capital.” At the heart of the new revival strategy is foot-traffic data that points to the emergence of a new CBD rhythm: Wednesday has become the city’s busiest day, and twilight the most popular time period. Capp says the council’s night-time economy advisory committee is “rallying” to develop a new program of events scheduled in the 4-7pm time slot to “activate” the twilight period. “Traditionally, there hasn’t been a lot of thought put into twilight,” she says. “We’re looking at: can we run a big busking program just to stop people and get them to be entertained and engaged? Or can some live music venues have an earlier set that starts at 5pm and finishes at 6.30pm – then people may go on to something else?” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra this year added “Quick Fix at half six” performances on Monday evenings to its 2022 schedule. The MSO’s managing director, Sophie Galaise, says they’re designed for audiences wanting to enjoy an earlier performance. “The idea is: come to your office – if you still have one. Join us right after your work. It’s only one hour, and you can have a drink before, and dinner after,” Galaise says. “It’s an uplifting start to the week, so people may be more likely to return to the city later in the week. People just love having a good time – and we’re a provider of good times and extraordinary beauty.” The state government is launching an “Art After Dark Melbourne” that will see museums – including the National Gallery of Victoria and the state library – host special events until 1am, but over the course of a weekend in May, rather than during the week. James Young, the owner of CBD live music venue Cherry Bar and chair of the council’s night-time economy advisory committee, is adamant the city’s rhythm has changed and hybrid office schedules must be embraced for the next stage of Melbourne’s cultural revival. Young says the Melbourne zoo’s popular twilights series has been a source of inspiration for the revitalisation of the early evening period. “We’re thinking about it across the entire city, where you’d have a twilight program, and some precincts would be family focused, art focused, Indigenous-education focused. But it’s the idea of doing something far-reaching that hasn’t been owned before by a city. So it’s one suggestion that has been made to the City of Melbourne which it’s considering,” he says. But Young believes the key to the city’s cultural revival is also “establishing a new Melbourne” that reimagines what the CBD is. “As much as we’re keen to resuscitate the CBD, we think the future of Melbourne is not around a central business district but rather a radical rethink, where we might refer to our cities as having a central social district or a central experience district,” he says. Young says Melbourne should follow “forward-looking” countries like Iceland and Belgium that moved towards adopting four-day working weeks – with the same pay – arguing it has the potential to transform the cultural landscape. “The thing about the four-day week is by rotating that day off throughout the week, you can help activate that night off. Because if we have tomorrow off, we’re going out tonight,” he says. “That would have an enormous impact on the restaurants, hospitality, entertainment and the theatres if this kind of thinking was adopted.” While the city’s bold visionaries are looking to other cities, Young also believes the world’s eyes are on Melbourne. “When you’re the most locked-down city, when you’re set free, you’re the most free,” he says. “I think the whole world is looking at Melbourne thinking, what are you about to produce? What’s going to happen in Melbourne? Because they were repressed the most and are known for their creative community.” “If we get this right, the way we set up Melbourne now will be talked about for decades. People will look back and think a pivotal moment in the growth and definition of Melbourne was 2022, when they came out of those two horror years and they thought about themselves differently and did things differently.” For Capp, Melbourne’s exuberance for live shows is one thing she believes is here to stay in the next chapter of the city’s culture. When the city emerged from the Delta lockdowns of 2021, Capp stood outside Regent theatre after a Sunday afternoon performance of Moulin Rogue and “let that energy of people coming out of there wash over me”. “It was wonderful and I think that’s what really makes Melbourne distinctive is that sense of excitement and energy that people have when they’ve just experienced something fantastic,” Capp says.",News/Australia news,Melbourne determined to be ‘a city of yes’ as it seeks to revive flagging cultural scene,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/melbourne-determined-to-be-a-city-of-yes-as-it-seeks-to-revive-flagging-cultural-scene
3/14/2022,"Joe Biden’s hardline stance on Russia has won him widespread plaudits, but with the most serious oil shock in decades now a reality, the US president’s attempt to cushion the blowback continues to meet resistance from the two allies he needs most. Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, and his counterpart in the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed, are yet to agree to a phone call with the west’s most powerful man – a scenario all but unthinkable during previous administrations. Biden’s immediate priority is for both countries to help exert maximum economic pressure on Russia by cranking up their oil output. Each capital is a major supplier of oil, with excess capacity, which would soften the effect on US consumers through fuel prices before midterm elections in November that threaten Democratic control of Congress. With relations between the Middle East oil powers and Washington at their lowest ebb in modern times, though, a reckoning is due that may realign the regional order on terms that favour Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Both leaders have made it clear that they will settle for nothing less, and are ready to extract their price. As if to show the Biden administration what it could do, the UAE ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, last Wednesday said it favoured production increases “and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels”, leading oil prices to fall by 13% the next day. But no action to increase supply followed and by the week’s end the price per barrel was back up to almost $130 (£100), an uncomfortably high level for Biden to take to the midterms. However, the standoff involves far more than oil. In Riyadh, Prince Mohammed feels snubbed by Biden’s refusal to engage with him ever since he took office. The murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by the crown prince’s security aides, the war on Yemen, the jailing of rights activists and the boycott of Qatar have made him a pariah to the administration. Disputes with Abu Dhabi are nearly as stark. The US has been particularly taken aback by UAE’s repeated abstentions in the UN security council, which have been seen by western diplomats in New York as a quid pro quo for Russian support of some of the anti-Houthi positions it wanted the council to take over the war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been incensed by the Biden administration removing the Iran-backed Houthis from the global terror list as they continue a painstaking series of negotiations with Iran to restart the Obama-era nuclear deal shredded by Donald Trump. Beyond that, though, there is a strong feeling in both capitals that Biden has approached the region with a deeply critical view of countries that had long been security allies, and lenient on Iran, which remains a foe. Having attempted last week to recruit Venezuela to the cause of isolating Russia, the White House views efforts at repair work on the relationship with Saudi Arabia and the UAE as an acceptable price to pay. The administration in February sent Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for Middle East policy, and Amos Hochstein, the state department’s special energy envoy, to Riyadh for a meeting with the crown prince. On the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury announced sanctions on an alleged Houthi financing network. Sir John Jenkins, a former British ambassador to Riyadh and a senior fellow at the UK thinktank Policy Exchange, said ties that had been growing between Riyadh and Moscow, particularly since Biden sidelined Prince Mohammed, would probably need to be recalibrated if a reset was to take place. “I think it’s very complicated,” he said. “I wouldn’t make a one-way bet on Putin myself. But that’s how the Saudi position in particular will look to many in DC. That will just piss people off. And tempt them in turn to bet on Iran instead. You have to deal with [Prince Mohammed]. But if he demands a complete climbdown from Biden, I don’t think he’ll get it. “There has to be some way of squaring this circle. A renewed US promise to defend KSA [Saudi Arabia] and the UAE from Iran is one way. Redesignation of the Houthis and a renewed commitment to settling Yemen in a way that would suit Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is another. But I can’t see Biden saying he’s simply going to forget Khashoggi. “I personally don’t think Russia matters that much to KSA. China’s far more important. Beijing wants to avoid a collapse of global trade – or a prolonged western recession. And there are signs Beijing is trying to position itself appropriately. The risk then is that a hard line from Riyadh will just backfire.” Robin Mills, the CEO of the UAE-based consultancy Qamar Energy, said increasing oil supply, and therefore reducing prices at the bowser, was a relatively straightforward technical process, but carried political and economic risk in dealings with the global oil body Opec, of which Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are members. “They could ramp up supply within one month and reach full capacity within 90 days,” he said. “Opening chokes on wells, restarting wells entirely, perhaps restarting gathering and production stations. “Everyone has always cheated on Opec agreements when it suited them. Can you do it quickly? Not tomorrow, certainly. But unless something’s gone seriously wrong, KSA should be able to make a three-month difference. That in itself would help – to a degree – in calming oil markets.”",News/US news,White House faces oil standoff with Saudi Arabia and UAE as prices soar,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/white-house-us-joe-biden-oil-output-prices-saudi-arabia-uae
3/14/2022,"Victoria’s public schools face a dire funding shortfall of almost $20bn, with new analysis revealing funding growth for private schools is five times higher than for the state’s government schools. Analysis from public schools advocacy group Save Our Schools shows that combined federal and state funding for government schools from 2019 to 2029 would be about $19.5bn below the Gonski review’s recommended funding benchmark – the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS). Victorian private schools will be over-funded by almost $400m over the same period, according to the analysis. Trevor Cobbold, an economist and convener of Save Our Schools, said Victoria – already the jurisdiction with the lowest funded public schools – faced an unprecedented funding crisis in the government school sector. Cobbold said it would see the education inequity gap – that the 2011 Gonski review aimed to end – sustained until at least the end of the decade. “This translates into not being able to overcome teacher shortages and huge differences in human and material resources between public and private schools,” he said. “Public schools don’t have enough teachers, they have a significant proportion of teachers teaching out of field, they have poor quality educational materials and they have poor quality infrastructure and all those factors impact on student learning.” Victoria’s deputy premier and education minister James Merlino said he had continued to ask the commonwealth to do its “fair share” and lift its contributions for public schools from 20% to 25% to ensure the sector is brought up to its full SRS. “It has consistently refused to do so. I’ll continue to urge the commonwealth to show the same level of commitment we have to Victorian students,” Merlino said. But a spokesperson for the acting federal education minister, Stuart Robert, said commonwealth funding for Victorian public schools had grown at a faster rate than the state government’s investments. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The spokesperson said states and territories can boost their minimum funding commitments for government schools. “We would welcome any proposal from the Victorian government to do so,” the spokesperson said. The Save Our Schools analysis considered government spending over the 10 years to 2020, as well as current funding agreements. Adjusted for inflation, there was a 5% rise – equal to an additional $667 per student – in combined government funding in public schools between 2009-10 and 2019-20. For independent schools, funding growth of 27% was recorded, an increase of $2,582 per student. This is despite needs-based funding reform initiated more than a decade ago. In mid-2019, Victoria became the last state to sign up to the Morrison government’s Gonski 2.0 education reform deal, after a stoush with the commonwealth in which the federal government threatened to withhold its funding to the state’s schools. The SRS benchmark sets a base amount for each student to estimate how much total public funding a school requires to meet its cohorts needs and includes additional loadings for factors of disadvantage, such as disability and Indigenous heritage. The new analysis found Victorian public schools are now only funded at 84.6% of their SRS, while the state’s private schools are funded at 101.7% of their SRS.

Some of the state’s most wealthy private schools are overfunded due to commonwealth funding exceeding its target of 80%. Additionally, it found state government funding for public schools, which enrol about 80% of Victoria’s most disadvantaged students, fell by $1,477 per student, adjusted for inflation, under the then-Coalition government between 2009-10 and 2014-15. It then increased under the Andrews government between 2014-15 and 2019-20 by $1,041 per student, adjusted for inflation. But the funding has not recovered to its previous high in 2009-10, which was, adjusted for inflation, $11,306 per student. In 2019-2020, the Victorian government spent $10,870 per public school student. The Save Our Schools analysis is partly based on Australia’s productivity watchdog’s latest report on government services for 2019-20, released last month. But it excluded depreciation and school transport, as these items are not included in the funding figures for private schools. The analysis’ projections, which is also based on data provided to Senate estimates, includes the commonwealth’s $1.2bn choice and accountability fund. This funding is outside the needs-based model and is designed to soften the financial impact for non-government schools during the transition to a new funding model. In 2017 the Turnbull government passed needs-based education funding legislation – dubbed Gonski 2.0 – based on the SRS. Under the reform, overfunded independent schools – receiving more than 100% of its SRS – would have funding brought down to their SRS benchmark by 2029 while underfunded public schools would have their funding increased over the same period. As part of the 2019 bilateral deal – due to expire next year – federal government funding transitions to 20% of the SRS target for public schools by 2023, and the Victorian government to 75% by 2028. The agreement required Victoria to lift its contribution towards the SRS of each schools from 67.8% – the nation’s lowest per-student share – to 75% over the same time period over the same 10-year period. At the time, the Andrews government argued the deal unfairly funded public schools less than private school students. Under the deal, states are also allowed to include items not originally deemed part of the SRS benchmark in the Gonski model – such as depreciation and transport as part of their share of public school funding – for up to 4% of the SRS. Cobbold said this meant the state’s “true” contribution is closer to 71%, and further contributes to the underfunding of the government school sector. The opposition education spokesperson David Hodgett said under the Andrews government “more money isn’t equalling better results”. “The Victorian Liberals and Nationals will get our children’s development back on track by keeping schools open and placing a renewed focus on the fundamentals,” Hodgett said. The Greens’ education spokesperson Sam Hibbins said the party urged the state and federal governments to “fully fund Victoria’s public schools to 100% of the original Gonski recommended funding levels” in the next bilateral agreement. “Without extra funding, Victoria’s public schools will miss out on billions, whilst private schools will be hundreds of millions more dollars than what’s required,” Hibbins said.",News/Australia news,"Victorian public schools face $20bn funding shortfall, analysis shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/victorian-public-schools-face-20bn-funding-shortfall-analysis-shows
3/14/2022,"Expectant mothers are having planned home births cancelled within weeks of their due dates, with Victoria’s ambulance crisis putting intense strain on the state’s maternity services. Victoria has just two publicly funded home-birth programs at Sunshine and Casey hospitals – both of which are now temporarily suspended. Assisted home births require ambulances to be available in case of any complications during the procedure. Guardian Australia understands pressures in the state’s ambulance services have contributed to the pause in both programs. It means women currently wanting access to assisted home births must turn to private midwives that cost about $5,000. The opposition health spokesperson, Georgie Crozier, a former midwife, said home births were another service that had declined due to the state’s ambulance crisis. “There’s been a lack of planning and preparation and now Victoria’s health system is in crisis and it’s impacting on women’s choice to have home births,” Crozier said. Depleted staffing levels in the state’s triple-zero service has left it plagued by lengthy call-wait times, with the state coroner investigating reports of people dying while waiting for calls to be picked up. The Andrews government last week announced it would pour an additional $115.6m into the emergency services sector to fund 120 new call-takers. Kelly Langford, co-founder of private practice Midwives and Mothers Australia, has seen an influx of women wanting to book home births because they have experienced last-minute cancellations in the public system. Langford said hospital home births require “an ambulance to, theoretically, be on standby”. “If there’s more strain on the health service then it has an impact,” she said. Melbourne mother Jane Gould-Dowen, 30, had planned to have her second child through Sunshine hospital’s home birth program last month, as she felt it offered her the most “safe, secure and supported” environment. She was advised in early January – at 33 weeks – that her birth would be unable to go ahead through the scheme, which was paused in October, a month after she had booked the home birth. She was later advised that the midwifery group practice program – which offers continuity of care for expectant mothers – was also being stopped and that she would need to be moved to the Mercy hospital as she was in their catchment area. “That month of January, with everything cancelled, was so stressful,” Gould-Dowen said. “I was crying so much and it was such a hard thing. “It’s such a really huge mental shift to have to have undertaken and do that. It’s massive and it’s not something that you want to have to be dealing with towards the end of your pregnancy when you’re trying to slow down.” Gould-Dowen said being plunged back into the “general maternity system” with no continuity of care meant she opted for an unassisted home birth. “I just felt really backed into a corner, in that I was like, I don’t, I don’t know what to do,” she said. First-time mother Ruby, 27, gave birth to her son two weeks ago at Sunshine hospital. Despite also booking into the hospital’s home birth programs, she was 34 weeks pregnant when it was confirmed it would be unable to go ahead as planned. “It was quite upsetting,” she said. “I remember I looked at the bag I’d packed for the hospital and I just cried … I felt so out of control. A birth is a really important time in a woman’s life and in a baby’s life. And to be, you know, to not have a say in how that goes … was really sad.” A Victorian government spokesperson said “every effort is being made to resume home birth services as soon as it’s safe to do so”. A spokesperson for Monash Health – which includes Casey hospital – said it had temporarily suspended its home birth program to “ensure the safety of all pregnant women and their babies in our care”.“We highly value our home birth program and look forward to resuming the service when it is safe to do so.” Wendy Watson, divisional director of women’s and children’s services at Western Health – which oversees Sunshine hospital – said its home birth program was paused due to “Covid-related pressures on the healthcare system.” About 0.3% of births in Australia took place at home in 2019, according to the Australia Institute of Health and Welfare. But Victoria’s public home-birthing programs saw a rise in demand during the pandemic, with some expectant mothers worried about potential exposure to Covid at a hospital and support person restrictions. In 2013, Victoria’s last birthing centre – designed to provide a home-like environment for women with low-risk pregnancies and take pressure off the state’s hospitals – was closed. In July last year, the Andrews government announced a $13.2m investment to ease pressures on the state’s maternity services, after reports of understaffed maternity wards and women giving birth in emergency rooms and corridors. But the six-month funding has now run out. The Greens’ deputy leader and emergency services spokesperson, Ellen Sandell, urged the government to undertake a “comprehensive review” of the state’s public maternity care system to determine how to better care for people during pregnancy. “We need to invest a lot more in good maternity care, including 1:1 midwifery care and small family birth centres, to take the pressure off hospitals and give people more supportive care in pregnancy and birth,” she said. “If Victoria hadn’t closed our family birth centres, and had invested a lot more in 1:1 midwifery care early on … women might not be facing these distressing situations now.” ",News/Australia news,Home births cancelled at short notice due to Victoria’s ambulance crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/home-births-cancelled-at-short-notice-due-to-victorias-ambulance-crisis
3/14/2022,"New documents reveal the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption has asked detailed questions about a $107,000 grant made by the former deputy premier, John Barilaro, to Monaro Farming Systems, a company linked to the family of federal cabinet minister Angus Taylor. The grant was paid out of Local Land Services funds – part of Barilaro’s then portfolio of regional NSW – in 2018, and was announced by the deputy premier. It was used by MFS to fund a pilot project on alternative ways to identify native grasses instead of the method used under federal environmental legislation. The work has been used by the Taylors, who are major landholders in the Monaro, and others to lobby for changes to the federal government’s listing of native temperate grasslands as critically endangered. In line with its policy, Icac refused to confirm or deny if it was investigating the grant. The $107,000 grant has been controversial because, as the Guardian has previously reported, there appears to be little paperwork to support the grant and the then chairman of MFS, Richard Taylor, thanked Barilaro for it in MFS’s annual report. At the time of the grant, Jam Land, a company in which both federal energy minister Angus Taylor and his brother Richard had an interest, was under investigation by the federal Department of Environment for illegally spraying native grasslands at Corrowong. Guardian Australia has reported extensively on how Angus Taylor met with senior bureaucrats in the federal Department of Environment soon after the investigation into Jam Land started. Taylor says he met only for briefings on the grassland protections and did not raise the investigation into his family’s company. Jam Land has now been ordered to remediate the property, but is appealing against the ruling in the federal court. Icac’s interest in the grant is revealed in a new document that was made public last week under a call for papers by the upper house of NSW parliament, after Greens MP David Shoebridge successfully contested a claim for privilege. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Marked “sensitive: NSW cabinet”, the briefing note reveals that in April last year, the corruption watchdog sent an official letter to LLS “pertaining to the funding provided to Monaro Farming Systems to undertake the Grasslands Pilot study”. “LLS provided a written response, answering all queries and supplied information as requested,” the document says. “As advised by Icac this response is not to be made public under any circumstances as it may prejudice investigations should Icac deem them necessary.” Another document, also released last week, reveals another $50,000 grant to MFS was the subject of an internal probity review by the director of audit and investigations in Barilaro’s former department. This followed revelations in estimates last June that a senior unnamed bureaucrat in the Department of Primary Industry, part of Barilaro’s portfolio, had written a note to file querying whether the grant was “ethical” and posing the question: “Is it bribery?”. The bureaucrat was also concerned the money was being dressed up as a contract for services when it was really a grant. A chat note also tabled in estimates recorded the deputy director general, Kate Lorimer-Ward telling a bureaucrat “we have been directed by the deputy premier to provide them [MFS] with $50K”, and they should keep the contract “high level and vague”. However, the probity report reveals Lorimer-Ward has now described her previous claim of a direction by the deputy premier as “factually incorrect” and “unwarranted” and that there was no such direction. She told the investigators the comment was motivated by “having dropped the ball” on drafting the MFS contract and trying to speed up progress. This appears to have satisfied internal investigators that there was “no evidence of corrupt conduct” although it sent the report to Icac as a courtesy. It did, however, find numerous problems with the department’s processes. These included that a DPI officer is a board member on MFS, but no record had been logged in the department’s conflict of interest register. The bureaucrat was not involved in allocating the grant. It also found a lack of documentation around the contract with MFS. There was no written quote from MFS to deliver the services, no clear specification of what would be done under the contract, it was not registered with the procurement team, and there was no documentation as to whether the contract was assessed as value for money. Nonetheless, the probity auditor cleared the grant. “It is no wonder the Coalition tried so hard to hide this probity report, it basically accepts that white is black and black is white in order to get the government off the hook,” Shoebridge said. “I’m glad that these records also show that Icac is reviewing it because the department reviewing itself has clearly failed. “Monaro Farming systems has now had almost $800,000 from the NSW government over the last decade and it’s hard to understand why they keep winning these grants. LLS declined to comment on Icac’s involvement. It did however confirm that it had paid $107,000 to MFS for a project known as “Monaro Grasslands Best Management Practices” as well as two grants in Walgett. “It is understood that the reports from these projects provided information on the application of land management policy in these two regions,” a spokesperson said. Comment was sought from Barilaro and from MFS but neither responded by the deadline. Monaro Farming Systems is an agricultural cooperative that was founded by Richard Taylor. It undertakes work for a group of graziers in the Monaro region of NSW, including scientific studies and lobbying.",News/Australia news,Icac queries Barilaro grant to company linked to Angus Taylor’s family,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/icac-queries-grant-made-by-john-barilaro-to-company-linked-to-angus-taylors-family
3/14/2022,"Leaders in northern New South Wales are concerned they will not be able to “build back better” with flood relief money and will instead be forced to rebuild the same flood-prone roads and bridges, leaving communities at risk. While Transport for NSW works to restore the most critical of the hundreds of roads that have been damaged or swept away in the disaster, councils are also turning their thoughts to the future. Kyogle mayor Kylie Thomas wants to see a safer and more resilient area rebuilt on the other side of the floods, or she fears the same devastation will happen again next time. “My greatest concern is that we just get all this money to fix our roads – but just fix them, not build them better,” she said. “We really do need to start moving what bridges where we can, see what roads we can build back higher, wider, stronger – instead of just replacing same with [the] same.” Kyogle council is still assessing the damage across its patch, where at least 50 homes were gutted and the CBD was inundated, and Thomas predicted a large bill once every road and pothole has been looked at. She wants the state government to commit to longer-term funding for the rebuild so it is not rushed and construction contracts could be secured. “Give us the whole big picture and let us to have some space [so] that we’re not just going to be scrambling from one grant to the next,” she said. So far, about $1.5bn in support for flood-affected areas has been promised by the state and federal governments to aid in the recovery, including $285m for temporary housing. Byron mayor Michael Lyon agreed with Thomas, having raised the issue with NSW regional infrastructure minister Sam Farraway over the past two weeks. “If you’ve got something which you needed to improve anyway, and then it’s been washed away, it makes sense to improve it,” Lyon said. He hoped the government would make funds available to councils for improvements while they were rebuilding. “Even if there was some kind of loan mechanism to do that through the government, that would be something we would definitely take up,” he said. Ballina deputy mayor Eoin Johnston said councils would need more funding to raise critical roads in low-lying areas – but it would be tough to future-proof all areas. Johnston noted suggestions in the past to raise homes in Ballina, which was not possible for many. “The infrastructure is going to cost money for all the shires – it was already behind before these floods came,” he said. “[We need to] repair what is damaged. Elevate some roads. You can’t have these towns cut off like that. We need more money.” The opposition energy services spokesperson, Jihad Dib, said “skimping on costs” now would do future generations a disservice. “Rebuilding damaged infrastructure must take into account ways to mitigate the sort of damage and danger we have seen in these latest floods. “We have seen that current infrastructure is not fit for purpose and to rebuild in exactly the same way is shortsighted and not future-proofed. “We owe it to local communities to rebuild structures in a better way, like-for-like replacement will not necessarily be the best option in many cases.” Federal MP for Richmond, Justine Elliot, described the situation in the northern rivers as a “humanitarian crisis”, calling for more funding for councils in the recovery. “I’ve been strongly calling on the state and federal governments to deliver more funding for businesses, individuals and councils,” she said. When asked if the government would reconsider future developments in flood-prone areas, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, confirmed the issue was being looked at. Speaking from a recovery centre in South Windsor, he said there would always be risks to property and people in catastrophic events but it could not be business-as-usual from here on. “You can’t just keep doing the same thing the same old way ending up in the same situation and do nothing about it,” he said. “We need to have some fair-dinkum discussions and some work around how can we improve things going forward. “We’ve to do everything we can to prevent these events from being as catastrophic as they can be, and there is no better time to be having those discussions and looking at it than now.” A spokesperson for Transport for NSW said the first priority would be restoring the most critical of the hundreds of roads that were damaged, some of which were still unusable. “Assessments of what needs to be done in the long term will be carried out by specialists,” the spokesperson said. “The views of all stakeholders, including local councils, on what needs to be done will be taken into account.”",News/Australia news,Flooded NSW communities call on government to fund more resilient roads,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/it-makes-sense-to-improve-flood-hit-mayors-fear-road-rebuild-wont-reduce-risk
3/14/2022,"If there was ever a template of success for the modern Australian independent movement, it would look something like Clover Moore. Sydney’s lord mayor has stood as an independent candidate across two different levels of government 14 times, and has never lost an election. Now 76, Moore almost certainly has fewer years left in public office than others, but her ambitions for independents, at the upcoming federal election and beyond, are big. “It’s terrific,” she says of the number of female independent candidates hoping to unseat Coalition MPs in May. “[Holding the balance of power] is the only way we will get real reform. The two major topics that they are running with are climate change and integrity in government.” Moore is hopeful that having an empowered crossbench will see the “things that the major parties won’t do” happen, including the introduction of a fixed term for federal governments, which she had a hand in introducing at a state level in New South Wales. Sitting down with the Guardian at her Redfern home during one of Sydney’s recent rainstorms, Moore doesn’t mince her words about the people in charge in Canberra. “It’s a terrible government, isn’t it?” she says. She pauses, before adding: “I work with all governments, but really. Where we’ve sought support from the federal government on housing affordability, on action on climate change – nothing.” Moore doesn’t sugarcoat how tough it is to raise funds as an independent, let alone get elected. Major parties have teams working to attract donations at all hours, whereas independents have smaller teams and shoestring budgets “doing all the things that the electoral commission is demanding”. She feels “quite sorry” for the Warringah MP, Zali Steggall, whose campaign received a $100,000 donation from the family trust of former coal company director John Kinghorn. Asked if the public outcry was justified, Moore says people “don’t have any idea” how hard it is. Moore is “conscious of legacy” but also brushes off the suggestion she’s out the door anytime soon, despite being in public office since the 1980s. “I’ve just won an election,” she says. She recounts a story from the end of last year, about how everyone at a pub near her house gave her a standing ovation when she was re-elected for a historic fifth term. “They are not sick of me, which is quite nice. It’s really hard, but it’s really worthwhile. That’s why I keep doing it.” Moore’s home is a gallery of that hard work, and the bits of the gig that keep her going. It hits you in the front hallway – a wall plastered with pictures from her adventures in public life. There she is, beaming next to Barack Obama (“oh, he was lovely”), and in another photo grinning with Lady Gaga, a far cry from her official NSW parliamentary photos that hang nearby. The hall opens into the living room of her parkside apartment, dripping with brightly coloured art, each with a personal story. Some of the pieces, she says, are very familiar to her colleagues after two years of Zoom calls from her dining table. “On one hand, you can say you got more done because you didn’t have travel time, but it meant you didn’t have a break,” she says. There are sleepless nights as Covid continues to wreak havoc, with lines at food banks that Moore thought she’d never see on that scale in her city and major hits to the council’s budget, which she had worked so hard to bring into balance. “Do I wake up at three and four in the morning? Do I struggle with sleep? Yes and yes,” she says. Walks kept her going through lockdowns – often accompanied by her two dogs, Buster and Bessie, who also feature in a large portrait of Moore hanging in the living room – but she struggled. After a rough start, Moore says the former premier Gladys Berejiklian’s cabinet “made a decision to work constructively with the city”. She was pleased, because she felt people were better served by governments that were able to work together to achieve outcomes. “People in local government and state government are expected to work together,” she says. Other than appearing at some press conferences asking people to come back to the city – and some events to work out how to do just that – Moore says she hasn’t had a lot to do with Dominic Perrottet since he became premier. “I had a bit to do with him when he was treasurer through activating the city. He seemed really interested in ideas,” she says. Moore also notes a positive relationship with the treasurer and former energy minister, Matt Kean, and bemoans the loss of the former transport minister Andrew Constance, with whom she reports a good working relationship. Her ambitious ideas for transport in the city, including the expansion of cycleways and introduction of electric buses, will now have to go through the beleaguered transport minister David Elliott, whose recent comments about not needing to answer the phone in the middle of the night she found “funny”. “How could he not know?” she asks, talking about the metropolitan train network shutdown. “The whole thing was really odd.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Top of Moore’s immediate wishlist is making rail transport free on Sundays so people can bring their bikes into the city and explore. She hopes it will get people back into the habit of coming into the city that she has dedicated half her life to improving. Watching it shut down and empty out when the virus hit was hard. “You know those films you see after a bomb has been dropped or everyone’s left for some reason? It was like that,” she says. “It was really quite extraordinary. Still beautiful physically but people make a city. What people like to do is look at people. Looking at people, noticing their funny habits.” She’s banking on the human urge to connect, collaborate and stare at each other to eventually lure people back in, but will use the power she has to speed up the process, having already requested council staff return to work three days a week.

She’s proud of the streetscaping along George Street and hopes the return of cruise ships will see tourists hop on the light rail to Chinatown, which has largely languished since 2020. Lunar New Year celebrations earlier this year were the first taste of what she hopes is a big year for the area. “The streets were packed and there was music,” she says. “We walked down from Town Hall to Chinatown and it was the first time I really experienced George Street as we envisioned it would be. It was just buzzing and everyone was on the street and everyone was at outdoor cafes and our seating had people on it. The people had taken over.” Eventually Moore would also like to see a surface congestion tax for the CBD – something she is only starting to give serious thought as the transport links improve with the addition of her beloved light rail and metro that is still being built. “As we’re getting adequate public transport, it’s certainly something I could support,” she says. Asked about her plans for the city, it’s clear Moore thinks in decades. In 20 years, she hopes Sydneysiders are able to swim in the harbour and cycle to work no matter where they live in their fully electric house. She also wants dual plumbing in all homes so drinking water doesn’t go down the loo. “There are a lot of projects still in the pipeline,” she says.",News/Australia news,‘They are not sick of me’: Clover Moore on her hopes for female independents and bringing Sydney back to life,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/they-are-not-sick-of-me-clover-moore-on-her-hopes-for-female-independents-and-bringing-sydney-back-to-life

3/14/2022,"More than 90,000 hectares of koala habitat in Queensland was cleared in a single year, according to new analysis that finds most of that clearing occurred for beef production. The analysis, produced by environmental organisation The Wilderness Society (TWS), examined the Queensland government’s most recent Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats), which showed landholders cleared 680,688 hectares of woody vegetation in 2018-19. It calculates that 92,718 hectares of that clearing was in known or likely koala habitats, roughly equivalent to bulldozing two thirds of the Brisbane local government area, the organisation said. The vast majority of the clearing – 73,825ha or 80% – was for beef production. Anita Cosgrove, the acting Queensland campaign manager for TWS, said most of the habitat destruction was not referred for approval under Australia’s national environmental laws. “[As] weak as existing deforestation and species protection laws may be, what is actually most alarming is when they simply aren’t applied at all,” she said. “Governments must take the action needed to effectively address species declines, and it’s also well and truly time to take a good, hard look at the industry most responsible for the damage. “In Queensland, that is the beef industry.” The analysis was produced by examining the Slats data and publicly available data from the federal government on the habitats of listed threatened species. It follows the recent upgrading of the koala’s conservation status to endangered by the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has also promised to adopt a national recovery plan for the species. TWS has previously called for improved approaches from the beef industry and from companies that buy and sell beef products. In 2018, it produced a report on clearing in Great Barrier Reef catchments that argued industries could expose themselves to financial risk in future as a result of deforestation. That same year, land-clearing laws were tightened in Queensland, after they were eased under the previous Newman government. The government has since introduced higher-resolution technology to capture the amount of clearing, meaning Slats data from 2018-19 cannot be directly compared with data from previous years. Organisations such as WWF Australia have said the continued high rates of clearing in the state suggest the changes to the law have failed to curb habitat destruction and that the old monitoring methods had likely resulted in an under-reporting of clearing in the years before 2018-19. Cosgrove said both the federal and state governments needed to take stronger action to protect habitat for species at risk of extinction. This included adopting the national environmental standards recommended by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel in the once-in-a-decade review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. But she said industry could also take steps by ensuring that the beef products in their supply chains were sustainable and deforestation-free. “Only a minority of producers are responsible for the large rates of deforestation,” she said. “The big retailers of beef need to support the majority of producers that are already doing the right thing.” Mark Davie, a Queensland-based farmer and the chair of the steering committee for the Australian Beef Sustainability Framework, said clearing figures were higher since the change in monitoring methods and the methods did not capture the quality of what was being cleared. Davie said the clearing included invasive species such as lantana and rubber vine, and farmers did not want to put more pressure on animals such as the koala. “No one wants to make koalas more endangered,” he said. Davie said there had been a resurgence in on-farm projects to manage biodiversity but the industry was still looking for better incentives that enabled farmers to balance running their operations and protecting the landscape. “I get the intention of The Wilderness Society and I’d love us to come together and get a solution that isn’t a solution from a satellite, it’s a solution on the ground,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Land-clearing destroyed 90,000 hectares of Queensland koala habitat in single year, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/land-clearing-destroyed-90000-hectares-of-queensland-koala-habitat-in-single-year-analysis-finds
3/14/2022,"The former officer in charge of the Queensland police domestic violence unit says decades of “Band-Aid” and “patchwork” reforms have clearly failed to protect vulnerable women, amid growing calls for a royal commission to examine repeated police failures. Last week, an inquest heard how a desperate Logan woman, Doreen Langham, contacted police 20 separate times and was “basically told to go away and don’t come back” in the days before she was killed by her former partner. Retired Insp Regan Carr, the former Queensland police state domestic and family violence coordinator, said she “felt sick” reading about Langham’s situation. “It’s the same story, it’s like a broken record to a certain degree,” Carr said. “It’s 2022 and women are still dying horrifically. We have so much research, so much evidence, we have the best of the best equipment, and we’re still not getting it right. “Part of it is asking, ‘What is it that has to change?’” Carr, a 34-year veteran of the QPS, said her comments should not be read as a criticism of individual police officers, who in many cases were overwhelmed by the sheer volume of domestic violence incidents. “I cannot imagine how let down some of these frontline officers must feel. They must feel extremely disheartened, because I know they don’t go to work with the intent of harming people,” Carr said. “At the end of the day the people we have to listen to in all of this is the victims. “I’ve spent most of my career working with vulnerable people and vulnerable victims. I’ve always believed that we have to be their voice, we have to be there for them. Whatever we do we have to take the burden off them.” Carr said the state’s response to escalating domestic violence had been like a “patchwork quilt” and that constant amendments to legislation, recommendations or tweaks to policy were not having enough impact. “It’s not a big enough Band-Aid; you can’t keep doing it,” Carr said. “You can’t keep saying, ‘We’re doing this, we’re doing that’ when there’s clearly something that’s not quite right. “Sometimes you’ve got to be brave, really brave, as a government, as a community … to ask why are we not collectively getting this right.” At an inquest last week, the Queensland deputy state coroner, Jayne Bentley, was told that two weeks before Doreen Langham was killed her former partner, Gary Hely, threatened her life. Langham called police to report the threat. Each time Hely breached a domestic violence protection order, Langham contacted police. She called and went to two separate police stations. On 22 February last year – 15 days after Langham first called police – Hely bought 10 litres of petrol, entered her townhouse at Browns Plains in the Logan area, and set the place alight. By then Langham had made more than 20 calls and spoken to at least 16 separate officers. Criminologist Kerry Carrington, from the Queensland University of Technology, was given access to the coronial file, including transcripts of those conversations. “She reported breaches to the police five times in the week before she was murdered and all but one officer told her to basically go away and don’t come back and just come into the station once a week because you’re coming in too often to report breaches,” Carrington told the inquest. “She was desperate, absolutely desperate. “None of that seemed to get through to the police who picked up the phone.” Carrington, an advocate of the South American model of specialist police stations for women and families, said that had such a station existed, Langham would have been met by a trauma-informed councillor, taken seriously, and listened to without judgement. “Then she would have been interviewed by a police officer who works from a gender perspective and understands domestic and family violence is a cycle of coercive control.” Over the past week, as the Langham inquest repeatedly made front page news in Queensland, the police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, sent a communique to all officers that said while most police work is excellent there had been “instances where we have failed victims”. Under Carroll – especially since the deaths of Langham and Gold Coast woman Kelly Wilkinson – reforms have been made. In her statement to officers, Carroll pointed to a trial allowing police to use body-worn cameras to record victim statements; a dashboard tool to target high-risk perpetrators; district based victims’ units; the establishment of a police advisory group; and a police-wide domestic and family violence audit. Where police remain at odds with others – including researchers, women’s groups and the state women’s safety taskforce, chaired by former court of appeal president Margaret McMurdo – is in the extent to which police culture contributes to repeated police failures. Carroll and the police union are opposed to a recommendation of the McMurdo taskforce for a royal commission into “widespread cultural issues”, having taken submissions from women about their experiences reporting domestic violence. “A Queensland woman seeking police help to stay safe from a perpetrator enters a raffle – she may get excellent assistance, or she may be turned away,” the taskforce report says. “Unfortunately, the taskforce has … heard that many police officers right across the state are not responding to women’s complaints of domestic violence and this is putting women’s safety at risk.” On Tuesday, the deputy police commissioner, Tracy Lindford, gave a press conference after a domestic and family violence death in the Logan area. She spoke about the sheer volume of the problem. “Once again we see the complexities of domestic and family violence,” Lindford said. “In the last financial year, we dealt with 120,000 domestic violence occurrences. Our people right now in the QPS spend 40% of their time, police time, investigating domestic and family violence. So that is the scale of the issue that is out there. “While the vast majority of the time our people get it right, there are occasions where we don’t. “I don’t think there’s a cultural issue. [Police] are taking a lot of action and they’re doing it every day. “Since Ms Langham’s death there’s been a lot that has taken place to make sure we do better.” The deputy state coroner is examining whether those changes are sufficient; Carrington and others say past inquests show that police have previously promised reforms, and that these have not been effective. More than a decade ago, Noelene Beutel was beaten within an inch of her life. According to the coroner, two police officers who spoke to her in hospital “responded poorly … and wrote off the job”. She was murdered – by the same man who put her in hospital – six months later. The inquest into the 2011 killings of Antony Way, Tania Simpson and her daughter Kyla detailed how a police officer did not consider the killer’s prior controlling behaviour to be domestic violence. The report on the death of Indigenous woman Elsie Robertson in 2013 outlined what police themselves concluded was “an unreasonable delay” of more than an hour between a call for assistance and officers attending the address in Cairns. The inquest into the 2015 death of Mr M – killed by his partner’s ex – described the police response as “inadequate” and beset by “inaction and tardiness”. In each of these cases, the inquest findings detail how police have committed to reforms, including better education for officers, reviews of policies and procedures. Carrington says more now needs to be done. “This is a systemic, institutional issue and it goes to the core of police culture,” she said. The Queensland government will ultimately decide whether to adopt the full recommendations of the McMurdo taskforce and hold a commission of inquiry – a final call will likely be made by state cabinet. Such a move might be politically difficult; the influential union that represents rank and file officers has called the taskforce report “woke”. Queensland’s attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, told Guardian Australia the government was “prepared to take action” on issues raised by the taskforce, including how to improve frontline responses. “The [taskforce] recommendations are based on the submissions of over 700 brave women who came forward to share their experiences with the system and how it failed them,” Fentiman said. “We know there is more to do and government is carefully considering all of these recommendations and will be providing a response soon.”",News/Society,"Queensland’s ‘patchwork’ response to domestic violence has clearly failed, police veteran says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/14/queenslands-patchwork-response-to-domestic-violence-has-clearly-failed-police-veteran-says
3/14/2022,"Sometimes, body parts become the unlikely stars of the red carpet. A decade ago, it was “Angelina’s leg” that went viral at the Oscars; this year it’s the turn of the neck. Yes, you read that correctly. It’s the neck’s time to shine. As red carpets flicker back into awareness post-Covid, there’s something apt about a body part as random as the neck having time in the spotlight. It fits well with the awoken-from-a-daze feeling most of us have as we sleepwalk back to normal life. At the Baftas on Sunday night, the neck was encased in various polo necks, shirts and dresses. It was accompanied by the heads of How to Get Away With Murder’s Elliot Knight, The Witcher’s Emma Appleton, Daniel Kaluuya, Cyrano’s costume designer Massimo Cantini Parrini and star of Belfast Caitríona Balfe. It’s the latest part of a “come hither” trend taking over on social media recently, but where tummies, derrieres, cleavage and bits of collar bones have been revealed and then withdrawn under outfits that look as if they could be blown away by a strong gust of wind. And yes I know “sexy neck” is about as appealing as it sounds, but it’s part of the so-called “vibe shift”: slipping out of the arid, sexless, Covid-era sadwear into the reckless roaring 20s (this was what hot vax summer was supposed to be but sadly didn’t materialise). The peek-a-boo neck could not be more of a now trend. From tech bros to scammers and international spies, disgraced MPs to pop-art icons, there’s something wickedly shh-shh about the whole look. It’s one part James Bond and two parts Milk Tray man: it’s a look that screams “hidden agenda!” through cutesy tucks and turns. Pop culture is positively drowning in polo necks, whose depth of tuck reveals how much (or little) of the neck we actually see. We’ve had Amanda Seyfried in The Dropout, as Silicon Valley grifter Elizabeth Holmes. Holmes wore a black Issey Miyake polo neck as she attempted to cosplay at the gravitas of Steve Jobs while fooling the world out of millions of dollars; Paul McCartney wore one in Beatles’ doc Get Back, attempting to marshal his band into shape without too much “bad dad” energy and Andy Warhol is currently sporting one for his return as an AI robot in Netflix’s The Andy Warhol Diaries. In fact, there’s a definite question mark over whether you should trust someone wearing a polo neck. That Matt Hancock has recently taken to wearing one says it all really.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Sticking your neck out: the glitzy come-hither trend of awards season,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/13/neck-awards-season-baftas-2022
