1/4/2022,"Just six years ago Forbes magazine declared her the “the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire” and the “next Steve Jobs”. Now, Elizabeth Holmes, the 37-year-old founder of the collapsed blood testing company Theranos, is facing decades in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to defraud her investors out of billions. Holmes, a university dropout with no medical training, had fooled regulators and some of the world’s richest people, including Rupert Murdoch, Henry Kissinger and Larry Ellison, into believing she had figured out a way to test for a range of health conditions with just a pinprick of blood.  But the tests didn’t work, and the company was accused of often faking the results. Some patients were told they were miscarrying when they were pregnant; others were given false-positive results for HIV. Following a number of regulatory investigations, the company – which at one point was valued at more than $9bn – collapsed in 2018. On Monday a California jury convicted Holmes of four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Holmes had set her sights on becoming an inventor at an early age. She hoped to emulate her great-great-great-grandfather, who co-founded Fleischmann’s Yeast, which revolutionised the breadmaking industry in the late 1800s. At the age of nine, she told her father that what she “really want[s] out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn’t know was possible to do”. While a 19-year-old freshman student at Stanford University, she thought she had found it. Working out of the basement of her shared college house, she founded Theranos in 2003. Brimming with self-confidence, she convinced her parents to let her drop out of university and cash in an education trust they had set up for her. She used it to rent a lab and hire her first employee. Holmes’s desire to improve medical testing was driven by a familial aversion to needles, that could cause both her mother and her grandmother to faint at the sight of blood. “I really believe that if we were from a foreign planet and we were sitting here and said, ‘OK, let’s brainstorm on torture experiments,’ the concept of sticking a needle into someone and sucking blood out slowly, while the person watches, probably qualifies,” she told the New Yorker in 2014 for a profile that said Holmes had the potential to “upend the lucrative business of blood testing”. Holmes, who helped engineer the comparisons to her idol, Jobs, by dressing in black turtlenecks, quickly became a star on the public speaking circuit. Addressing a TedMed conference in 2014, she said getting a blood testshould be easier, quicker and cheaper. It should be, she said, “a wonderful” experience. “We see a world in which no one ever has to say, ‘If only I’d known sooner.’ A world in which no one ever has to say goodbye too soon,” she told the Washington DC audience. “The right to protect the health and wellbeing of every person, of those we love, is a basic human right. Yet in the United States today, healthcare is the leading cause of bankruptcy and the lack of it the leading cause of ... finding out too late in the disease progression process that someone you love is really, really sick.” The top comment under the video on YouTube says: “She did a better job playing Steve Jobs than Ashton Kutcher” (Kutcher played Jobs in the 2013 biopic Jobs). “Here was a photogenic, telegenic young woman posing as the female Steve Jobs,” recalled Margaret O’Mara, a historian of Silicon Valley who holds a professorship at the University of Washington. “It was an incredibly alluring narrative that everyone wanted to believe.” Not quite everyone. Holmes’s tall tales began to unravel in 2015 – soon after Theranos hit its record $9bn valuation – when the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou began an investigation into the validity of the company’s tests. When Carreyrou went to Holmes for comment for his story, she asked the Journal’s owner, Rupert Murdoch – a Theranos investor – to prevent its publication. “You personally went to the owner of The Wall Street Journal to try to quash the story,” Robert Leach, an assistant US attorney, asked her during the trial. “I did,” she replied. Carreyrou’s story was printed. Dozens more followed, eventually leading to the collapse of the company, taking with it Murdoch’s $125m investment.",News/Technology,Elizabeth Holmes: from ‘next Steve Jobs’ to convicted fraudster,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/04/elizabeth-holmes-from-next-steve-jobs-to-convicted-fraudster
1/4/2022,"A statue to the 19th-century fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anning, who was once “lost to history”, is finally set to be unveiled in 2022 in her home town of Lyme Regis after a schoolgirl’s four-year campaign. Campaigners, who have overcome bureaucratic red tape and raised more than £100,000 in crowdfunding, have been granted planning permission to site the bronze in “the perfect spot”, overlooking Black Ven cliffs on the Jurassic coast in Dorset, where she made her pioneering finds.  Evie Swire, 13, was nine when she first heard of Anning, born in 1799, who sold fossils to supplement her family’s meagre income and who is the subject of the film Ammonite, starring Kate Winslet. Disappointed there was no local tribute to Anning, who in life was largely ignored by the scientific establishment yet is now regarded as a significant female force in science, she began the Mary Anning Rocks campaign. But first the coronavirus pandemic, then disputes over where the statue should be sited, looked likely to thwart plans to unveil the work, by the sculptor Denise Dutton, on the 223rd anniversary of Anning’s birth in May 2022. Anya Pearson, Evie’s mother, said plans to place the statue near the giant anchor viewpoint on Lyme Regis seafront were resisted, and the project was then added to a long list of applications amid the pandemic. Another proposal, to place the statue on a cart road below the Marine theatre, was also rejected. “But now we finally have the perfect spot for her, facing Black Ven [cliff] and Golden Cap [hill]. Black Ven is where she found most of her fossils, and it is just the most evocative spot, looking out to sea,” said Pearson. ‘It is the same background view as that in the only portrait ever painted of Mary. So there is great connectivity. “It’s been a long battle, and at one point I really thought the whole project might be strangled by bureaucratic red tape. I thought the hard-part would be the fundraising, not getting planning permission. “But the local people really got behind it, and have been amazing,” she added. The clay model of Anning and her dog, Tray, which is one-and-a-quarter lifesize, is due to be cast in bronze in early 2022, with the unveiling scheduled for May. As part of the campaign, whose patrons include Sir David Attenborough, and the academic and broadcaster Prof Alice Roberts, the Mary Anning Rocks learning legacy will enable children from underprivileged backgrounds across the UK to visit the statue and go fossil hunting on the beaches, “discovering the next generation of Mary Annings”, added Pearson. Anning was responsible for many pioneering finds, including one of the first ichthyosaurus skeletons, and became immensely knowledgable in the then emerging field of palaeontology. But her finds were often credited to the male collectors to whom she sold her fossils. Her disappointment and frustration was evident in one surviving letter, in which she wrote: “The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone.” She died aged 47. The planning application papers said that, despite coming from a poor background, Anning’s finds changed the way scientists thought about the origins of our planet and how life evolved on it. It read: “Throughout Mary Anning’s lifetime, her achievements have largely gone unacknowledged with her name having been eradicated from the historic archives due to her being an uneducated, working-class woman and an outsider to the polite and scientific community.” Anning had not previously been championed in the town, “because she was just not known about”, said Pearson. “If she had been male and upper class, a statue would have been raised over a hundred years ago.” “I really feel we have finally righted a historic wrong.”",News/Science,‘Perfect spot’: statue of fossil hunter Mary Anning nears unveiling,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/04/perfect-spot-statue-of-fossil-hunter-mary-anning-nears-unveiling
1/4/2022,"A 60-year-old comic featuring the Incredible Hulk – in which the superhero is depicted in his original grey, rather than his signature green – has been sold for almost half a million dollars. The rare copy of Incredible Hulk #1, which was published in 1962, was bought by a private collector for $490,000 (£360,000). Comic Connect, an auction site which handled the sale, said it was the most expensive copy of the first Hulk story ever sold.  Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the comic reveals the Hulk’s origin story, in which the scientist Dr Bruce Banner is exposed to toxic gamma rays, and thenceforth transforms into the Hulk when he loses his temper. In his first outing, the Hulk is shown with grey skin, but Marvel changed the colouring to his now-signature green for the second issue, because the four-colour printing process at the time meant the grey came out differently on different pages. The issue is graded “very fine/near mint” on the comics grading scale. “Highly graded copies of Hulk No 1 are notoriously hard to find, due to the cheap paper used and the smudging of the grey colour on the front cover,” said Vincent Zurzolo from the comics site. Zurzolo predicted that the issue would “continue to gain in value”. “Vintage comic book values just keep going up,” he added. The Hulk has a long way to go, however, before he smashes the record set by his Marvel stablemate, Spider-Man. In September, a copy of the 1962 comic Amazing Fantasy #15, in which Spider-Man makes his debut, sold for $3.6m (£2.5m).",Arts/Books,"Rare first edition of The Incredible Hulk comic sells for $490,000 ",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/04/rare-first-edition-of-the-incredible-hulk-comic-sells-for-490000
1/4/2022,"Where does Prince Andrew drive to in his brand new £80,000 Range Rover, seemingly his only appearances these days in anything that could be considered the outside world? The duke is often pictured motoring broodingly out of his Royal Lodge home in Windsor at the wheel of this high-performance vehicle, perhaps making his in-car security detail listen to a podcast about putting, or a funny song about a whoopee cushion. (The precise contours of Andrew’s cultural life have always remained a tantalising mystery). Some local visits to his mother at Windsor Castle have been chalked up, as well they might be. But we’ll come to the duke’s ominous financial reliance on the Queen in a minute. Were The Artist Formerly Known As Airmiles to take an aimless intra-Berkshire spin this morning, he would be able to listen to news reports concerning the newly unsealed settlement his accuser reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. Virginia Giuffre signed a $500,000 deal with Epstein, and Andrew’s lawyers believe her agreement not to sue anyone who could be described as a “potential defendant” could get HRH off the hook of having to face, in civil court, her claims that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was a minor. (He denies everything, vehemently.)  If this does succeed in persuading a judge to dismiss Giuffre’s current suit, then once again someone else’s money will have insulated Andrew from alleged self-created realities. It always seems to be someone else’s money, of course. In this case, it would be the $500,000 of a dead sex trafficker. However, other funds are available. Andrew’s mother is widely reported to be paying his legal bills for this increasingly grotesque saga, which will be running well into seven figures by now. What follows can only be speculation, with the duke’s case not due to be heard till later in the year. But having his legal fees quietly covered by the Queen would feel like the very upper limit of what a lot of people in this country would accept. There are, of course, many committed anti-royalists in the UK, but the British public don’t in the majority regard the 95-year-old sovereign as the sort of freeloader at whom they might scream “we pay your wages”. The Queen’s various vast incomes have not been a hot topic of debate in recent years in whatever counts as middle England. But in the event that Giuffre’s case against Andrew proceeds and he loses it, and a multimillion dollar payment has to be made, you get the feeling public attitudes would change overnight if the maternal bailout ran to forking out Andy’s damages for him. You can imagine people who are quite happy for the Queen to spend money restoring obscure Scottish castles and whatnot suddenly feeling less relaxed about it being spaffed on paying blood money for a sex offender. Whatever the accounting, I’m not sure any distinction between public funds and private income would be made by the average person. Anyway, that’s enough banging on about Andy’s mama. Not that I haven’t very much enjoyed the recent articles by gentlemen of a certain age who have FINALLY found a woman they care about in the long-running Epstein story. Unsurprisingly, perhaps – it’s the Queen! Here at last is a lady tangentially connected to the grimness whose honour and dignity actually matters, as opposed to the other ladies involved, whose tribulations they have at no point been interested in writing about. Even Ghislaine Maxwell has elicited more sympathy in some quarters than the actual victims of Epstein. And, indeed, the victims of Maxwell herself. Madam has now been found guilty of recruiting, grooming and trafficking teenage girls for sex with Epstein, not that you’d know it from the airtime still bafflingly given on both sides of the Atlantic to those such as her brother Kevin Maxwell. Ah, the classic “sex offender’s brother” interview slot. You probably remember it from other trials such as … no, sorry, I can’t put my finger on any. Drawing a big old blank here. In any case, what does Kevin Maxwell know about anything? Four-hundred million pounds was stolen from the pension funds of a business empire in which he was the second-most powerful person, and a fraud trial acquitted him of having a clue about it. So I think broadcasters can spare audiences his “insights” on anything else, ever again. Infinitely more worth listening to are the victims themselves, who may be permitted to make victim impact statements at Maxwell’s forthcoming sentencing. Giuffre could be among them. The other thing worth listening to, alas, is the ongoing sound of silence where the mention of other men’s names should be. Despite the saga rumbling on for years, we still have little idea who all the other men involved in this seedy web were, and absolutely no indication that anyone in law enforcement cares enough to find out now that they have got their woman. I can’t help feeling those hoping Ghislaine will name names for clemency are being pretty optimistic. Given that Ghislaine believes Epstein was murdered in jail, as opposed to killing himself, it seems unlikely she would expose herself to what she would presumably regard as a likely similar fate, should she begin singing like a canary. Seemingly all of Epstein’s friends were power players, chosen for their use to him, and they must all have known rather a lot about his proclivities. Way back in 2002, Donald Trump was joking pointedly to New York magazine that Epstein liked them “on the younger side”. Beyond that, plenty of ageing Epstein buddies were involved in his web of abuse, accepting hospitality on “Paedo Island”, ferried in aboard his “Lolita Express” private plane. But they’ve all retreated into their money, their omertàs, and the timeworn knowledge that reckonings are for women and other little people. Epstein knew the code better than anyone, which is presumably why he took care in his 2009 settlement with Giuffre to exempt others from being named as “potential defendants” in the future. What a thoughtful legacy to his bros. And how remarkable that Prince Andrew should regard seizing it as his best defensive shot. Swerving court via a loophole provided by one of the leading international paedos of the age … Well, if that isn’t staying classy, then I really don’t know what is.

1/4/2022,"Southampton are on the brink of a takeover that would see the Serb media magnate Dragan Solak become a major investor in the Premier League club. Southampton are expected to confirm a takeover on Tuesday afternoon, with Solak, the founder of United Group, a telecoms company, understood to be a key player. The takeover would mark the end of the reign of Gao Jisheng, after almost four and a half years as the club’s majority shareholder. Gao bought an 80% stake for about £200m in August 2017. The Chinese businessman has been keen to sell for the past 18 months, only for interested parties to withdraw. His investment in the club has been extremely limited but Ralph Hasenhüttl has repeatedly steered the team away from relegation.  The former majority owner Katharina Liebherr is expected to retain her 20% stake and the chief executive, Martin Semmens, is set to remain in post. Liebherr, her advisers, Semmens and the managing director, Toby Steele, have overseen the takeover process.

1/4/2022,"Women who are operated on by a male surgeon are much more likely to die, experience complications and be readmitted to hospital than when a woman performs the procedure, research reveals. Women are 15% more liable to suffer a bad outcome, and 32% more likely to die, when a man rather than a woman carries out the surgery, according to a study of 1.3 million patients.  The findings have sparked a debate about the fact that surgery in the UK remains a hugely male-dominated area of medicine and claims that “implicit sex biases” among male surgeons may help explain why women are at such greater risk when they have an operation. “In our 1.3 million patient sample involving nearly 3,000 surgeons we found that female patients treated by male surgeons had 15% greater odds of worse outcomes than female patients treated by female surgeons,” said Dr Angela Jerath, an associate professor and clinical epidemiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada and a co-author of the findings. “This result has real-world medical consequences for female patients and manifests itself in more complications, readmissions to hospital and death for females compared with males. “We have demonstrated in our paper that we are failing some female patients and that some are unnecessarily falling through the cracks with adverse, and sometimes fatal, consequences.” The findings have been published in the medical journal JAMA Surgery. Jerath added: “These results are concerning because there should be no sex difference in patient outcomes regardless of the surgeon’s sex. “On a macro level the results are troubling. When a female surgeon operates, patient outcomes are generally better, particularly for women, even after adjusting for differences in chronic health status, age and other factors, when undergoing the same procedures. Jerath and her colleagues analysed the records of 1,320,108 patients in Ontario who underwent 21 common surgical procedures performed by 2,937 surgeons between 2007 and 2019. They ranged from hip and knee replacements and weight loss surgery to removal of an appendix or gall bladder and more complicated operations such as a heart bypass, aneurysm repair and brain surgery. For each of the 1.3m operations they analysed, the sex of each patient and details of how their procedure had gone and also the sex of the surgeon who carried it out. They found that men who had an operation had the same outcomes regardless of whether their surgeon was male or female. However, women experienced better outcomes if the procedure had been performed by a female surgeon compared with a male surgeon. There were no gender differences in how surgery went for either men or women operated on by a female surgeon. Jerath added that while “there are some excellent male surgeons who consistently have good outcomes, what is concerning is that this analysis does signal some real difference among male and female surgeons overall where practice can impact general patient outcomes”. The researchers said the study was the first of its kind to examine the association between the sex of the patient, the sex of their surgeon and the outcomes of surgery. They looked at three types of “adverse postoperative outcome”: death, readmission to hospital and complications within 30 days. They found that for women, treatment by a male surgeon was associated with a 15% increased likelihood of a poor outcome than if they were treated by a female surgeon. However, men experienced no differences whether they were treated by a male or female surgeon. Similarly, women who were operated on by a male surgeon had a 32% higher risk of death than those whose surgery had been performed by a woman. For example, while 1.4% of women who had a cardiothoracic operation with a male surgeon died, fewer – 1% – did so when a female surgeon was involved. In both brain surgery and vascular surgery, while 1.2% of women who underwent either type of operation with a male surgeon died, again that proportion was much lower among those whose surgeon was female – 0.9% – giving a 33% higher risk of death. Overall, female patients also had a 16% greater risk of complications and an 11% greater risk of readmission and were 20% more likely to have to stay in hospital longer. Women had a higher risk of death, readmission or complications when a man performed the operation across many of the 21 types of surgery analysed. For example, while 20.2% of women who had cardiothoracic (chest) surgery by a male surgeon suffered some form of adverse reaction, a lower percentage – 18% – did so if their surgeon was female. The same pattern was seen in general surgery, brain surgery and orthopaedic surgery. Technical differences between male and female surgeons are unlikely to explain the findings “as both sexes undergo the same technical medical training”, said Jerath. “Implicit sex biases”, in which surgeons “act on subconscious, deeply ingrained biases, stereotypes and attitudes”, may be one possible explanation, she said. Differences in men’s and women’s communication and interpersonal skills evident in surgeons’ discussions with patients before the operation takes place may also be a factor, she added. And “differences between male and female physician work style, decision-making and judgment”. Fiona Myint, the vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, highlighted that 86% of consultant (senior) surgeons in Britain were men. “Surgery is still a long way from having a gender balance in its workforce. Women make up 41% of early stage surgeons but only 30% of higher trainees and 14% of consultants,” she said. Parenthood, “a lack of flexibility in [surgical] training schedules and rotas” and “negative attitudes to less than full-time training” all explain why many women do not become consultant surgeons, she added. Scarlett McNally, who has been a consultant orthopaedic surgeon for 20 years, said there was “increasing evidence of a different experience for women surgeons, with many being put off surgery and reporting historical ‘microaggressions’”. In addition, female patients may feel more at ease talking to a female surgeon before the operation, including steps they should take to improve their chances of a good outcome, such as stopping smoking to help ensure a bone graft takes, she added. McNally also cited “unconscious bias” – assumptions among senior surgeons, nurses, administrators and patients that female medical students or young doctors will not want to pursue a career in surgery – as a factor. “Having more female surgeons would improve all patients’ outcomes,” she said. The Royal College of Surgeons of England said the findings were “interesting. Much more detailed research is required looking at communication, trust and doctor-patient relationships.”",News/Society,"Women 32% more likely to die after operation by male surgeon, study reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/women-more-likely-die-operation-male-surgeon-study
1/4/2022,"This is a nasty, brutish, not-short-enough action film; basically one of those home-invasion stories in which brutal criminals terrorise a family. In this case the crims are led by newly released convict Johnny (Mickey Rourke, looking more melted than usual) and the family is a nuclear set-up led by James Baker (Michael Jai White), a DEA agent with PTSD. Johnny and co are supposedly trying is to recover money from a bank robbery, hidden years ago. But in this generally reprehensible subgenre, it doesn’t matter why the baddies break in. What matters is that it entitles at least one member of the terrorised family to fight back using their unique skills and, inevitably, armed force. Conspiracy-minded viewers might wonder if some of these films aren’t subsidised by pro-gun lobbyists as a way to drum fear into the audience and maintain support for the right to keep huge home arsenals to ward against a danger with a vanishingly small probability in the real world.  Produced, co-written and directed by Asif Akbar, The Commando contains a number of egregious implausibilities and cliches. For starters, Johnny’s henchmen are so stupid and bloodthirsty they can’t even wait for the occupants to leave the house before they invade. They just barge in while one of Baker’s daughters is having a small party. Several teens are shot, one while he’s having a wee and ends up spraying urine all over the most violent of the bad guys, Dominic (Gianni Capaldi, distantly related to Peter); this appears to be meant as a comic highlight. Finally, Baker and his wife come home and it ends, inevitably, with a series of fisticuffs, gunfights and brawls before good supposedly triumphs over evil, although one of the kids has been raped. Perhaps we are meant to infer she deserved it for throwing a party while her folks were away; that tells you everything about the intended audience for this pernicious nonsense.

1/4/2022,"How do I add texture to vegan pulse, pasta and rice dishes so my non-vegan family can’t complain it’s just mush?Signe, Brighton “It’s all about a drizzle, a dollop and a crunch,” says Bettina Campolucci-Bordi, author of Celebrate: Plant-Based Recipes for Every Occasion. “I add at least two to every meal, and that instantly creates different textures.” A drizzle could be something as simple as good-quality olive or flavoured oil (chilli, garlic, basil) or date syrup, while a dollop is essentially something creamy: “Hummus made from butter beans or chickpeas, a pesto or flavoured yoghurt, say.” As for the crunch, that’s “chopped toasted nuts, a chunky dukkah or za’atar, pomegranate, sunflower or pumpkin seeds, roast chickpeas flavoured with things like tandoori spice”. In short, Signe would be wise to adopt Campolucci-Bordi’s mantra of “more is better”.  Another tactic for avoiding the mush factor is to consider how you chop your veg. “With vegetables that need more cooking, such as potatoes, chop them small, whereas if you’re adding courgettes to the same dish, chop them bigger, otherwise they’ll go soft and mushy.” For extra oomph on the texture front, Craig and Shaun McAnuff, whose latest book, Natural Flava: Quick and Easy Plant-Based Caribbean Recipes, is out this month, favour roasting their veg (“for an incredible crust on the outside and melty insides”) or grilling it (“it gives you that crispy texture and smoky flavour”). Vivek Singh’s texture tricks, meanwhile, include frying mustard seeds and urid lentils with curry leaves and spices in oil, then tipping the lot into a lentil broth. Another option, says the executive chef and founder of The Cinnamon Collection restaurant group, is to top lentil and bean dishes with raw, pickled or lightly sauteed vegetables (think chopped broccoli or cauliflower). “You can also experiment by adding chopped nuts, fried shallots, and puffed or toasted flaked rice to the top of big, hearty bowls of lentils and rice for extra substance.” Some spicy scrambled tofu wouldn’t go amiss, either. Singh also recommends khichdi to keep Signe’s family’s objections at bay. “It’s a traditional, home-style rice and lentil dish tempered with cumin, turmeric and vegetables [cauliflower, peas, carrots, chopped tomatoes].” He ups the ante by serving it with a roast aubergine relish: “Stuff two aubergine halves with cloves of garlic and rub with mustard oil. Char the aubergine over an open flame, turning frequently, until blackened evenly on all sides.” Once cool, remove and discard the skin and the garlic, chop the flesh and mix with sea salt, red onion, chillies, coriander and mustard oil. Finally, when all routes point to pasta, Shaun McAnuff is partial to a “creamy, crunchy” vegan mac and cheese. He caramelises onion, garlic and chilli, mixes that with cooked pasta and vegan “cheese” sauce, and seasons. “Spoon into a deep baking dish, top with vegan mozzarella and breadcrumbs [you could even use broken crackers], and bake.” His brother, Craig, meanwhile, is all about pesto made with callaloo, a leafy Caribbean green. “All you do is caramelise garlic and mustard seed, then blitz with callaloo [or spinach], nuts, avocado, scotch bonnet and spices.” Toss that through cooked pasta and top with a sprinkling of nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews) for that all-important crunch.

1/4/2022,"Two NHS trusts in Lancashire have declared critical incidents in their hospitals owing to staff absences, as the region’s health chief said officials were “bracing ourselves for a tsunami of Omicron cases”. Morecambe Bay NHS trust, which operates three hospitals across north Lancashire and southern Cumbria, made its move on Monday evening, and the trust that runs Blackpool Victoria hospital followed suit on Tuesday morning, saying its beds were at full capacity.  They join at least six other trusts that are understood to have issued alerts over “internal critical incidents” in recent days, including United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust. In an internal memo, Morecambe Bay’s chief executive, Aaron Cummins, said “relentless and sustained pressure” caused by “unprecedented staff absences” would lead to operations and appointments being cancelled and staff being redeployed to allow the hospitals to maintain safe services for patients. The trust operates three sites: Furness general hospital in Barrow-in-Furness, the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, and Westmorland general hospital in Kendal. Barrow-in-Furness has the highest Covid infection rate of any local authority area in England, at 2,439.8 cases per 100,000 population. Both Lancashire trusts said staff absences were running at 10% or above, and high numbers of medically fit patients were unable to be discharged owing to the levels of coronavirus in the community. In a memo to colleagues, the Blackpool trust’s chief executive, Trish Armstrong-Child, wrote that “this has resulted in more people being admitted to hospital each day than we are discharging, which simply cannot be sustained as Covid infections continue to surge.” Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, which runs the Victoria hospital, Clifton hospital and Fleetwood hospital, said it was experiencing “high demand and long waits” for A&E and other urgent care. In a statement, it said the declaration of a critical incident was “an attempt to alleviate the pressure we are under, including stepping down some non-urgent activity in order to deliver all of the things we can and need to do to provide the very best care possible.” Cummins wrote that one issue at his trust was that “seriously sick patients are waiting too long to be admitted and there are many times when we are operating on a one in, one out basis”.

The state-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor (TTL) said it made the purchase in December to support Lithuania after learning the shipment was going to be blocked by Chinese authorities.  “TTL stood up at the right time, purchased the rum and brought it to Taiwan,” the company said in a statement reported by the South China Morning Post. “Lithuania supports us and we support Lithuania – TTL calls for a toast to that.” Lithuania is in an ongoing diplomatic dispute with Beijing, and has been hit with trade and other restrictions since it announced it would establish mutual diplomatic posts with Taiwan. The South China Morning Post said Taiwan’s finance ministry, which wholly owns TTL, and the de facto ambassador to Lithuania, Eric Huang, had learned China was going to reject the shipment, and informed TTL.

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. TTL and the producer of the dark rum, MV Group Productions, have not responded to the claims. However, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, Taiwan’s national development council, the parliament’s policy planning agency, posted a list of rum-based cocktails and other recipes and urged people to be ready to buy the product in late January. The post called on people to “support Lithuania”, saying the two countries were very friendly and had helped each other during the pandemic. The Chinese government has for months been applying pressure and blocking trade with Lithuania, outraged over Vilnius allowing the word “Taiwan” to be used in the name of Taipei’s de facto embassy. Taiwan usually uses the word “Taipei” in naming its diplomatic offices. Beijing claims Taiwan as a province and is hypersensitive to any action which appears to support Taiwan’s stance of being a sovereign nation. In recent years Beijing has frequently blocked or restricted imports from countries it is engaged in diplomatic disputes with, including coal, wine, and lobsters from Australia, and pineapples from Taiwan. Taiwan’s government is working to strengthen relationships with friendly nations as it seeks to resist Chinese aggression, and has in the past enthusiastically supported those hit with trade restrictions, urging Taiwanese people to buy up the product.",News/World news,"Taiwan ‘buys 20,400 bottles of Lithuanian rum rejected by China’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/taiwan-buys-20400-bottles-of-lithuanian-rum-rejected-by-china
1/4/2022,"Boris Johnson should not be given an honour by the Queen, Keir Starmer has said, as he accused the prime minister of treating voters like fools and promised a new “contract with the British people” to uphold trust in a future Labour government. In a speech designed to kick off a new phase in Labour’s preparation for the next general election, Starmer said reports of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid rules had not just exposed problems with Johnson’s own behaviour, but “the flaws of a whole style of government”.  Starmer said Labour had given ministers “the benefit of the doubt” on Covid restrictions to support the country through a national crisis but warned that the government had lost “the moral right to set those rules” because of the alleged rule-breaking. He signalled an intent to move beyond just criticising the government and to present optimistic alternative policies, vowing: “I came into politics to make things happen, not just to talk about them. I don’t think politics is a branch of the entertainment industry. I think it’s the serious business of getting things done.” During a speech in Birmingham, the Labour leader said his new contract would give people the assurance that Labour was ready for power by focusing on security, prosperity and respect. Name-checking the three Labour leaders who have won elections – Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair – Starmer said he would lead a “patriotic” party. “It’s normally the job of the opposition to criticise and oppose, but it can make us sound pretty miserable,” he conceded. “It can sound as if we don’t realise our own historical good fortune to have been born into a peaceful, creative, liberal democracy.” Starmer said the Conservatives’ recent plummet in the polls did not automatically mean voters would switch to Labour, and promised he had a strategy to show people over the next 12 months why his party was “worthy” of their support. “Trust has to be earned,” he added. “I am confident but not complacent about the task ahead.” Starmer said the number of Covid cases, which is almost double what it was during the third lockdown last year, was “cause for concern” but was hopeful that no extra restrictions would be needed. He criticised ministers over the rollout of jabs to children over the age of 12, and said better ventilation and mass testing was needed in schools to avoid them having to close again. The possibility of a more-transmissible variant or one resistant to vaccines was a “known threat”, Starmer said, adding that he would support cutting isolation from seven to five days if the government’s scientific advisers recommended it. He also said ministers should study “all available evidence” about whether a fourth vaccine may be needed to top up protection from Covid further, after Andrew Pollard, the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said it was “not sustainable” to keep topping up people’s immunity while millions around the world were still unvaccinated. Starmer also defended the awarding of a knighthood to Blair in the new year honours list, after a petition against the move surpassed 500,000 signatures. Asked if Johnson was worthy of an honour, he told the audience in Birmingham: “No. I’m sorry, I do not think the prime minister has earned the right to have an honour. I do think Tony Blair has.” Pressed by the Guardian on what policies Labour would use to woo back voters who had deserted the party since 2010, Starmer pointed to announcements made since he became leader nearly two years ago. He said the party’s stances on housing, employment rights and tackling climate change were “very strong, very Labour” and vowed that his contract would “build on that and take those ideas to the country”. Senior Labour figures are preparing for the possibility of a general election next spring. They said Starmer had reformed the party’s internal procedures, presented a strong case against the Conservative government and would during the course of 2022 move to outlining more positive policies to put it on an election-ready footing.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson would not deserve an honour, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/04/boris-johnson-would-not-deserve-an-honour-says-keir-starmer
1/4/2022,"Mountain rescue has urged day trippers to the Lake District to properly plan their walks after an “absolutely chaotic” Christmas period and warnings of blizzards on the way. The rescue group said there were 11 call-outs during Christmas week, including one that involved 75 people looking for a man and his 11-year-old son on Scafell Pike.  Richard Warren, the chairman of the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association, said his teams were called out a record 680 times in 2021 and the start of 2022 had been “just as busy”. Volunteers are braced for a potentially busy few weeks ahead as people take to the outdoors as part of a new year health kick. A cold blast of weather could put the skids on those new year resolutions, however. The Met Office has put a yellow weather warning in place for the Lake District this Friday with blizzard conditions and snow showers on the way. Snow is expected to fall across other high parts of the UK towards the end of the week, along with cold temperatures and blustery showers. In the Peak District, heavy snow showers are expected to fall on Friday followed by gale force winds at the weekend. Warren said there had been two call-outs on Christmas Day itself in the Lake District following a record 680 rescues last year. The previous record was 650 call-outs in 2018, but Warren said 2021 had eclipsed that despite the first three months of the year being “relatively quiet”. He said there had been a “very sad end to the year” when a man died after suffering a medical episode on Skiddaw on New Year’s Eve. Volunteers have urged people to check weather forecasts and whether they have the right gear before they take to the mountains. “A lot of rescues are avoidable because people get lost with no map, compass or torch,” Warren said. “Really we want people to start thinking about what they are doing, when they are doing it and to check the weather.” Warren said he was extremely proud of the all the volunteers at the 12 rescue teams in Cumbria. “We do it unpaid,” he said, adding: “Mountain rescuers don’t want to be paid. They do it because they love the mountains and love helping people.”",News/UK news,Lake District mountain rescue warning after ‘chaotic’ festive period,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/lake-district-mountain-rescue-warning-weather-forecast
1/4/2022,"This is not the start to the new year that any of us teachers in England had hoped for: increasing Omicron case numbers and ongoing uncertainty about how this will play out have created a nervous start for us all. As someone responsible for 350 staff working across three schools in south Oxfordshire I continue to be extremely concerned for their health, safety and wellbeing. As someone responsible for 2,700 children and young people I continue to prioritise their entitlement to an education. School leaders have spent the past 21 months of the pandemic balancing these two concerns.  The greatest risk to schools remaining fully open this term is the absence of staff who have to self-isolate because of contracting the virus. Many schools were up against it at the end of last term, forced to combine classes and to use an increasing number of cover staff and supply teachers (if they could find them) to keep classes running and year groups open. I am extremely doubtful that sufficient numbers of retired teachers will return to the profession this term to create the number of extra staff who may be needed. What more can be done to support schools and colleges? Quite a lot, actually. The government should provide ventilation units, free of cost, to all settings that need them: the 7,000 announced on Sunday will not be enough. Schools and colleges should be reimbursed for the additional sums they are spending on supply teachers, as well as other Covid-related costs, from already strained budgets. Ofsted should automatically agree to requests to defer inspections this term as school and college leaders are focused, quite rightly, on managing a crisis situation. Parents and families should ensure their children and young people test twice a week at home, without fail – and we need plentiful supplies of lateral flow tests to distribute to our families to enable them to do this. Exam results tables should be removed again this summer: schools up and down the country have been differently affected by the pandemic at different times, and this will continue to be the case. It’s not fair or appropriate to pretend that we have worked on a level playing field this year. School and college leaders have shown great leadership throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so. We prioritised keeping our schools open for our most vulnerable children and the children of key workers: our three schools have not been closed at any point during the national lockdowns. We pivoted from remote education to mass testing to managing the process of centre-assessed grades. We continue to be agile and responsive to a fast-changing situation, communicating well and regularly with our staff, students and families, providing reassurance and grounded optimism. There has been much talk about “a lost generation” of children, victims of the Covid pandemic. I refuse to believe that any generation should or will be “lost”. Instead of indulging in hyperbole, perhaps those with the power to make decisions could throw themselves behind those of us on the frontline working to keep young people in school, to maintain their entitlement to an education, to protect their health and wellbeing and to open doors to their futures. There is surely no more compelling call to arms, no more important investment in our future than this.

1/4/2022,"When Norwegian pop star Metteson was 18, he had an experience at a festival that made him understand the visceral impact music can have. While Emeli Sandé was performing Heaven, he kissed the boy he’d had a crush on for ages. “I wasn’t on drugs but I was as high as I’ve ever been and I had what was sort of my first sexual experience,” he says. “But the day after, I got brutally dumped when he told me that he was in love with someone else. The picture of the night before exploded and cracked.”  Feeling jilted, he went to watch Lana Del Rey: “She sang Summertime Sadness and I was crying all alone. Both those of those songs have stuck with me. They’re emotional triggers and I wallow in them. I just love when music really pushes experiences to another level.” Metteson’s own music feels destined to soundtrack similar scenes. Now 28, he creates kaleidoscopic pop that is unashamedly grand and theatrical. His debut EP, 2021’s Convince Me, flirted with the Scandinavian synth melancholia popularised by Robyn and the Knife, while also pulling from the arty chamber pop of Patrick Wolf as well as Whitney Houston and George Michael. His most recent single, the sumptuous Under Your Shirt, is a symphonic yet tender devotional that perfectly captures the sparks of intimacy and the heart-pounding ache of yearning. “I tried early on to make more compact melodies and cool club music,” says Metteson, “but I would whack on a big refrain because that’s what the emotion calls for. I’m not a whispery, cool and gritty singer. Whether that big refrain comes packaged as a club banger or a piano ballad, I want it to be a representation of myself.” Born Sverre Breivik and raised in the coastal town of Moss in Norway, Metteson – the name literally meaning the son of Mette, his mother – was always a creative kid. He was enrolled in various theatre and music groups and later studied at the National Academy of the Arts in Oslo. “I was a triple threat,” he laughs. “I was the loud, musical theatre kid, and I really think I bring a lot of that into my music now.” Since graduating, he has worked as a repertory actor at the National Theatre in Bergen. When we speak, he is just finishing up a run as Prior Walter in Tony Kushner’s Aids epic Angels in America – “one of the first shows that I ever saw and thought that there was a place for me in the world of theatre,” he adds. “It’s been a big deal for me.” Metteson initially struggled with his sexuality. “I can remember knowing from a very early age that I was different and that I liked boys; wearing women’s clothing and sensing that was, in some way, wrong,” he recalls. He remained closeted until he moved to Oslo to study. “It wasn’t a prison, but I regret it. Now I’m discovering the joy and the pleasures of being young.” His new music, due in the coming months, is evidence that he has taken that leap: building on the grandeur of Under Your Shirt, songs like Never Let Me Go and the baroque Second Heart run on melodrama and escapism. He also supports fellow Norwegian pop star Aurora on her UK tour this spring, a chance for British audiences to get a taste of that newfound freedom in action with his sensual performances (think a poppier Perfume Genius). “I think I make music that’s made to be experienced live,” he says. “I hope that I can blow people away with a perfect pop experience.”",Arts/Music,"Metteson: the Norwegian theatre kid embracing pop, pleasure and pain",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/metteson-the-norwegian-theatre-kid-embracing-pop-pleasure-and-pain
