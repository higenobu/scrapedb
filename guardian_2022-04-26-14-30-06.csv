4/26/2022,"The opening week of the BBC Proms will feature a newly formed Ukrainian orchestra that includes refugees and musicians who have been exempt from fighting, in a move the event organisers say will be a “powerful statement”. The Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra, which will play on 21 July and will be led by the conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson, includes 75 military-age musicians from European orchestras who have been granted military exemptions from Ukraine’s Ministry for Culture. David Pickard, the Proms director, said many in the British arts world have felt helpless as the conflict in Ukraine has escalated but that the orchestra’s presence would help. “I think everybody who’s involved in this project believes that is such a powerful statement to put these people together,” he said. Pickard also confirmed that unlike some other cultural events, Russian musicians and conductors have not been banned from performing at the Proms, which this year features 84 concerts and more than 3,000 performers from across the world. He said Russian performers would not be required to make a statement condemning Vladimir Putin’s regime because that could “put them in danger”, but added that he was confident there were none who were public supporters of Russia’s actions. “I think if there were somebody that were to express those views, to be putting it bluntly, there’d be no place for them,” he said. The Last Night of the Proms will once again be led by the Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who became embroiled in a row in 2020 over a proposal to perform Land of Hope and Glory and Rule, Britannia! as instrumentals because of social distancing rules limiting the number of musicians in the Royal Albert Hall. That decision was eventually reversed but in the aftermath Stasevska was blamed, even though she had nothing to do with it, and her family received threats. Boris Johnson and the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, both criticised the original proposal in a move decried as a “phoney culture war”. On 10 September, Stasevska will be joined by the cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the Norwegian opera singer Lise Davidsen and there will be a world premiere by the UK composer James B Wilson. Land of Hope and Glory and Rule, Britannia! will both be sung. Wilson’s work is part of a line up that is one of the most diverse ever, with a celebration of George Walker, the first African-American composer to win a Pulitzer, a prom dedicated to Aretha Franklin, work by Amjad Ali Khan, a session dedicated to South African jazz and an evening with Cynthia Erivo, who will be singing songs by Nina Simone and Gladys Knight among others. Last year’s event was staged as restrictions were being eased and was rocked by Covid-19 travel disruption with cancellations and late changes to the lineup. But this year Pickard said he did not anticipate the pandemic affecting proceedings. “We are planning on a normal summer,” he said. “We don’t have any contingencies … If something happens, then we have to change it.” This year’s Proms is billed as “a homecoming of large-scale orchestral repertoire”, with Verdi’s Requiem being played on the first night while Sir Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra perform Mahler’s Second Symphony. There will also be a first of its kind Gaming Proms, with music from the world of computer games played by the Royal Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Ames. “Minimalism meets baroque” when a new work by Anthony Roth Costanzo mixes Philip Glass and Handel’s work at the Printworks venue, which is better known as a clubbing destination. With “live painting” from George Condo, choreography by West Side Story’s Justin Peck and creative input from the fashion designer Raf Simons, it is seen as an event aimed at reaching new, less traditional Proms audiences. In the BBC’s centenary year, there will be the world premiere of This New Noise by Public Service Broadcasting. This is a multimedia piece including clips from the BBC’s archive and is named after the Guardian’s chief culture writer Charlotte Higgins’s book about the organisation that was released in 2014.",Arts/Music,Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra to perform at 2022 BBC Proms,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/26/ukrainian-freedom-orchestra-to-perform-at-2022-bbc-proms-refugees
4/26/2022,"The programme announced today for this summer’s BBC Proms makes much of its return to business as normal. There are a full eight weeks of concerts in the Royal Albert Hall this summer, after two years of severe restrictions – in 2020 just a fortnight of live music was livestreamed from an empty hall; last year’s season was also truncated and given almost entirely by British-based orchestras. But it’s back to the usual formula this year, with a large-scale choral work – Verdi’s Requiem – to launch the jamboree on 15 July, and a traditional Last Night conducted by Dalia Stasevska, with cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and soprano Lise Davidsen as the soloists. But in other, less positive, ways things are just a bit too much like they were in 2019, when the season seemed lacking in adventure and overcautious in its approach. There’s very little feeling of enterprise and imagination in the 2022 concerts either. Programmes seem to have been planned in a distinctly risk-averse way, with attention devoted to making sure that every politically correct box is safely ticked, with the full range of family concerts, gaming and relaxed proms, but perhaps not enough thought given to what might be genuinely challenging or adventurous in what still insists on describing itself as the biggest classical music festival in the world. The one major and welcome innovation comes in the complementary Monday series of lunchtime chamber music, which in recent years has taken place in London’s Cadogan Hall. This time the series of eight concerts is dispersed around the country, with recitals taking place from Truro to Glasgow, Belfast to Battersea. And for one evening concert the Proms deserts the Royal Albert Hall for an excursion to the Printworks in Rotherhithe, where English National Opera will present an “operatic spectacle” conceived by counter-tenor Anthony Roth Costanzo that mixes Handel arias with extracts from Philip Glass’s operas and song cycles (3 September). The year’s significant musical anniversaries of course get their due attention. The 150th anniversary of Vaughan Williams’ birth is marked not with a complete series of the symphonies but with a more wide-ranging selection of his works including the rarely heard tuba and oboe concertos. The bicentenary of César Franck, and the centenaries of George Walker, Doreen Carwithen and Iannis Xenakis are duly acknowledged, though in keeping with an approach that seems to worry about giving the audience anything that is too “difficult” or rebarbative, only one of the pieces by Xenakis is at all substantial. Ethel Smyth is generously represented too, not because there is any particular anniversary to mark, but mainly, one suspects, because Glyndebourne is bringing its new production of Smyth’s The Wreckers to the Albert Hall, providing a handy focus for a thematic thread. Though there is no longer the parade of the world’s orchestral great and good that used to be a feature of the final weeks of Proms seasons, there is at least this year a healthy representation of orchestras from overseas, including the newly formed Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra (31 July), the Oslo Philharmonic (12 August), and the Philadelphia Orchestra (8 and 9 September). There is the usual scattering of specially commissioned pieces and local premieres, but what’s missing are the special events, the kind of concerts that only the Proms, with all the resources of the BBC and the flexible space of the Albert Hall could afford to put on, whether that is a rarely performed opera, massive orchestral score or an electro-acoustic novelty. That kind of ambition seems to be nonexistent in planning the Proms nowadays, and it’s very depressing. Cassandra Miller premiere (18 July)The first of the year’s Proms commissions promises to be one of the most interesting. Miller is the latest composer to write a large-scale work for the viola player Lawrence Power, who introduces her concerto with the BBC Philharmonic. The Site of an Investigation (28 July)Jennifer Walshe’s deconstruction of a symphony receives its London premiere, in an unlikely pairing with Brahms’ German Requiem; Ilan Volkov conducts the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Il Tabarro (30 July)A concert performance of Puccini’s tragic one-acter, with the Hallé Orchestra conducted by Mark Elder, and Natalya Romaniw, George Gagnidze and Ivan Gyngazov as the protagonists. Prague Panoramas (5 August)Julian Anderson’s second symphony, inspired by photographs of the Czech capital in the 1940s, is premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, under Semyon Bychkov. Australian World Orchestra (23 August)Zubin Mehta makes an all-too-rare London appearance conducting a band drawn from 50 of the world’s leading orchestra in a programme of Webern, Debussy and Brahms. Märchentänze (26 August)Pekka Kuusisto is the soloist in Thomas Adès’s piece for violin and orchestra, based on English folk tunes. This New Noise (30 August)The BBC celebrates its own 100th anniversary with a multimedia commission from the band Public Service Broadcasting, using audio and visual material from the corporation’s archives. The Dream of Gerontius (31 August)Allan Clayton follows his huge success in the title role of the Royal Opera’s new production of Peter Grimes, by taking the leading role in Elgar’s masterpiece; Edward Gardner conducts the London Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra, Jamie Barton and James Platt are the other soloists. Berliner Philharmoniker (3 and 4 September)Kirill Petrenko brings his great orchestra to London for two concerts; the first is devoted to a single work, Mahler’s Seventh Symphony, the second pairs Schnittke’s Viola Concerto with Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony. Missa Solemnis (7 September)John Eliot Gardiner conducts the Monteverdi Choir and the period-instrument Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, with soloists Lucy Crowe, Ann Hallenberg, Giovanni Sala and William Thomas, in Beethoven’s late choral masterpiece.",Arts/Music,"Proms 2022: back to normal, but why settle for ‘normal’?

4/26/2022,"Strong winds and heavy rains are forecast for Chile and Argentina this week, because a strong jet stream is steering low pressure systems across that part of the world. South-westerly winds from the Pacific will feed in a lot of moisture, resulting in large rainfall totals on top of recent precipitation. Over two days, rainfall totals are likely to reach 30 to 60mm even at low levels across southern Chile, perhaps as far north as the capital, Santiago. The south-westerly winds will also pull in colder air, so significant snowfall is likely over the Andes with 50 to 100cm possible in 36 hours. Meanwhile, a secondary low pressure system will be cut off over Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. So while cold south-westerly winds blow over Argentina and Chile – where temperatures will be 10C below average in places – hot winds will raise temperatures by as much as 10C above average farther north. Temperatures will reach over 40C in places. The dividing line between these hot and cold air masses could bring severe thunderstorms. Over the next couple of days, these will mainly affect Uruguay, north-eastern Argentina and southern Brazil. However, high pressure will gradually edge into southern parts of South America during the rest of the week allowing thunderstorms to edge farther north while colder air will also spread northwards. Meanwhile, Europe is forecast to experience a very cold end to April and start to May. A large area of high pressure centred between the UK, Iceland and Scandinavia will remain stationary for at least the rest of this week, driving cold air southwards across central and eastern Europe from the Arctic. The development of a low pressure system over north-west Europe will then result in a renewed push of cold air southwards through western Europe by the start of next week.",News/News,Severe thunderstorms and rainfall forecast for parts of South America,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/26/severe-thunderstorms-and-rainfall-forecast-for-parts-of-south-america
4/26/2022,"The number of school leaders under the age of 50 who quit their jobs within five years of being appointed has gone up, according to as yet unpublished government data uncovered by a freedom of information (FoI) request. More than one in three secondary school leaders in England and one in four primary school leaders left at some point in the five years after their appointment in 2015, the official Department for Education (DfE) statistics showed. Close to half of middle leaders across both phases of education left within the same period, amid fears that the retention of the most senior staff in schools in England is in serious decline. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), which put in the FoI request after the government failed to publish updated figures, warned that leadership supply for schools in England is “teetering on the brink” and accused the DfE of failing to act on the crisis. Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said: “School leaders’ pay has been cut by 15% in real terms since 2010, and this, in combination with high stakes accountability, crushing workload, long hours, and inadequate school funding, is driving leaders from the job they love.” The worrying trend was uncovered in annual data collected by the DfE that details the number of head teachers, assistant and deputy heads, and middle leaders, under the age of 50 and new to post, who leave their job within five years of taking up the role. The new figures show that five-year retention rates have deteriorated across every category of school leadership since the data was last published in 2018. Comparing 2011-16 with 2015-20, the proportion of primary heads that left within five years of their appointment went up from 22% to 25%, while among secondary heads it increased from 35% to 37%. “The data that we have received confirms our fears that leadership retention rates have declined even further since 2015,” said Ian Hartwright, NAHT senior policy adviser, who led the research. “That is true, even taking account of two very disrupted recruitment years, where due to the pandemic there has been much less movement than might otherwise have been anticipated.” On Tuesday, the NAHT will give oral evidence to the school teachers’ review body, the independent panel that makes recommendations on pay, including the new information about the number of school leaders leaving their jobs early. “NAHT has pressed the DfE, literally for years, to act on this crisis,” said Whiteman. “But the DfE remains in denial about the systemic problems afflicting the profession. We urgently need the government to work with us to build a new, fair deal on pay, workload and accountability, to relieve the extraordinary pressures on the profession and make a lifelong career in education attractive and sustainable.” A DfE spokesperson said: “The overall picture of school leadership in England is positive – vacancy rates are low and the quality of leadership is high, but we do recognise school leaders have faced challenges. “That is why we are taking a wide range of action to support the profession, including investing £250m in training opportunities across all stages of teachers’ careers, plus the government’s pay reforms giving schools greater flexibility to reward exceptional leaders.”",News/Education,"School leader retention rates in England declining, DfE data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/26/school-leader-retention-rates-in-england-declining-dfe-data-shows
4/26/2022,"Sue Gray expects to complete her report into Covid law-breaking parties across Westminster at the end of May at the earliest, the Guardian has been told. Sources said that the senior civil servant, who for months has been forced to sit on her findings about illegal gatherings while Scotland Yard carries out its own inquiry, believes the police investigation could drag on for several more weeks. It may then take Gray a further fortnight for her to compile her report, meaning that it is possible the final version will not be delivered to No 10 for at least another month. One insider said they believed Gray was “working towards the end of May as the most likely timetable” for completing her report. Another admitted it was “wishful thinking” that Gray’s report would be published before the end of next month. While Gray was muted in her criticism of specific senior government figures in the “update” she published in February, she is expected to be far more critical of specific individuals, including Boris Johnson, in her report. A separate source said Gray was likely to be deeply critical of “how particular individuals ran No 10 and how that contributed to rule-breaking”. They added she was likely to offer recommendations about how similar law-breaking, cultural issues and confused lines of accountability should be prevented or dealt with. No 10 has committed to publishing the full version of Gray’s report. The Met has said it will not issue any further updates from its Operation Hillman squad which is investigating the partygate issues until after the May local elections. Some of those who attended gatherings in Downing Street have still not received questionnaires from Scotland Yard quizzing them on their attendance and whether they had a “reasonable excuse” for breaking the rules. Of the eight events under investigation by the Met, fines are said to have been handed out for four so far: A Cabinet Office leaving drinks in June 2020, the party held the night before Prince Philip’s funeral in No 10, a “bring your own booze” gathering in the Downing Street garden and a birthday gathering for Johnson in the cabinet room in June 2020, for which the prime minister was among those fined. Tory MPs are braced for Johnson to receive a second fine, with some preparing to wait for that moment until they submit their letter of no confidence in the prime minister in a bid to trigger a vote on his leadership. They are also considering a potential poor Conservative performance at the local elections as a chance to argue that the ongoing Partygate saga will continue to cost votes. In a bid to build bridges with the newer intake of Conservatives that won seats from Labour for the first time in 2019, Johnson’s new adviser, David Canzini, addressed the group known as “the blue barricade” on Monday night. Canzini was brought in to improve the political nous of No 10, and has been dubbed the “mini Lynton”, after the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby. Meanwhile, Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and a possible future Tory leadership contender, spoke to the One Nation Conservative group – known as the more moderate wing of the party. She discussed the Northern Ireland protocol and ongoing war on Ukraine, but insiders said it would be a helpful group to have the support of if a contest is held to replace Johnson.",News/Politics,"Sue Gray report to be completed by end of May at earliest, sources say",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/sue-gray-report-to-be-completed-by-end-of-may-at-earliest-sources-say
4/26/2022,"The true prevalence of drink and needle spiking remains unknown because of inadequate data collection, MPs have warned, after hearing of victims dismissed as having had “one too many”. Describing spiking as a “heinous crime”, the home affairs select committee called for urgent improvements in reporting, investigating and prosecuting spiking incidents. “We are pleased that the government is considering the case for a separate criminal offence for spiking. However, the most pressing need is for police to collect more data on perpetrators and their motives for spiking innocent victims,” the MPs concluded in an inquiry launched following a sudden increase in the number of reported spiking incidents last year. The committee also called for a rapid forensic testing service to ensure timely provision of forensic testing, admissible as evidence in court. Approximately 1,895 victims and 1,413 witnesses of suspected spiking incidents filled in a survey to explain what happened and what support was provided. Of the respondents, 355 victims had been spiked twice, 76 three times, 17 four times and 21 on five or more occasions. The National Police Chiefs’ Council reported 1,032 cases of needle injection between the beginning of September 2021 and the end of December, most of which occurred in October. The peak in incidents coincided with the start of the university year. By 26 January 2022, this figure had risen to 1,382. But the number of proven cases remains low. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine told the inquiry: “The academic literature that exists on spiking in the UK concludes that the majority of people who present to EDs [emergency departments] with concerns about spiking usually do not have illicit drugs in their blood or urine samples.” MPs heard that many of those who reported a suspected spiking incident were dismissed as just being drunk. “Even when victims report the crime, a victim-blaming culture can compound trauma and mean missed opportunities to collect evidence,” the committee reports. “Despite safeguarding training requirements for door supervisors, many victims criticise nightclubs’ treatment of victims, saying staff dismiss their concerns, eject them for ‘being drunk’, or refuse to provide CCTV footage.” Helena Conibear, the chief executive of the Alcohol Education Trust, told the inquiry that in culture was required among “A&E, GPs, the police and any of the frontline people who first meet somebody, including door staff and anybody in the night-time economy”, to move away from presuming someone was drunk, to recognising that they could be a victim of spiking. The government should support night-time industries to help boost security measures such as recruitment and training of security staff, the committee concluded. In addition, the Home Office should commission research to feed into a national strategy for prevention, detection and prosecution of spiking, the MPs said. The home affairs committee chair, Dame Diana Johnson, said victims were often left with feelings of “self-doubt and vulnerability” as they have little idea what happened or who spiked them. “It isn’t good enough to tell people to put lids on their drinks or normalise taking a testing kit out with you,” she said. “Everyone should have the right to go out and enjoy themselves without fear. The message needs to be sent to perpetrators that spiking is absolutely unacceptable and will be punished.”",News/Society,"Prevalence of drink and needle spiking unknown, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/prevalence-of-drink-and-needle-spiking-unknown-mps-say
4/26/2022,"It is the latest revival from the carefree early 00s to brave the fire-scorched hellscape of the 21st century. The relationship between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, AKA Bennifer, has roared back with a vengeance, with Lopez announcing their re-engagement this month, almost 19 years after they called off their wedding. When we talk about a couple’s chemistry, we usually mean something about sex. It is more literal with Affleck and Lopez, who create a compound that is far more compelling than Affleck or Lopez as single atoms. Here is a precis for those who weren’t alive or paying attention two decades ago. The couple met in 2001, while filming the universally panned romcom Gigli. Their subsequent romance led to Bennifer being defined on Urban Dictionary as “an attractive couple that have money, fame and beauty yet are still universally hated” and a “combination of two things that separately suck but when put together can achieve a level of sucking not understood by physics”. But that was just how the cool kids saw it. To the mainstream media, the pairing was blessed, recalls Marie O’Riordan, who was then the editor of the lifestyle magazine Elle. When two extremely famous people fall in love, “the story takes on its own momentum”, she says. “‘Will they break up?’ ‘Oh, they’ve got engaged?’ ‘What are they wearing?’ ‘Where’s the wedding going to be?’ It all plays out in front of you.” Perhaps in response to the pitiless scrutiny of their engagement – performed to an unblinking audience, like Cinderella in a carriage of glass – they went a bit bonkers. Affleck popped the question in late 2002 with an engagement ring that was reported to cost $2.5m; Lopez called it “the most magnificent thing I’ve ever seen”. (She didn’t actually finalise her divorce from her previous husband until 2003, but it is not bigamy if you only get engaged.) In 2003, they postponed their wedding “due to the excessive media attention”. By 2004, they had split up. She married Marc Anthony that June to become Anthopez, while Affleck married Jennifer Garner in 2005 to become Affgar. Neither of those titles took, but the relationships lasted well into the 10s. ‘Excessive media attention” is a bit of a red herring. It is possible that the real problem was our general overinvestment in the romance, as with Posh and Becks (married 1999, still together) and Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt (married 2000, divorced 2005). When everyone is wishing so hard upon a pair of stars, it must be hard to tell which feelings are real and permanent and which have been generated by the crowd. O’Riordan was at Lopez’s first wedding, in Lake Como in 2001, to the dancer Cris Judd. “Quite a lot of the senior British press were invited and we were all dancing round the top table, going: ‘But they don’t even know me.’ They didn’t even look happy.” When a couple is kiboshed by a context they can’t control, there may still be life left in the relationship. But is it a good idea to return to an old flame? How do you know whether you are rekindling something genuine or splashing around the lighter fluid of your life’s disappointment in an effort to reanimate something long since expired? Susanna Abse has been a marriage counsellor for decades and is releasing a book on the subject, Tell Me the Truth About Love, next month. She has never seen one of these back-together couples professionally. “That’s an interesting thing in itself,” she says. “They’re not a very large demographic going to couples’ therapy.” But there is a richness to a shared history that we all instinctively understand, she says. “I once did a lecture series on intimacy and I had pictures of different kinds of couples – a couple in a sexual embrace, couples in families with their children, then older couples, laughing with each other. I asked people what they thought was the most intimate picture. It clearly wasn’t the sexual picture; it was this couple laughing together. That sense: ‘We shared something. We know each other. We have a special “in”. I can stretch all the way back to the essential you.’” This feeling can be amplified if the first time you got together was also the first time you fell in love. Details will have etched themselves into your memory, making that person part of your identity for ever, regardless of whether you have maintained a friendship. Aled, 53, and Jem, 49, got back together in 2014 after meeting in 1995, when they had a blissful year of freedom, hitchhiking up and down the UK, going to gigs and festivals, at one point following Patti Smith to every date she played in the country. “It was one of those moments of illumination,” says Jem. “We were at the last Patti Smith gig in London and he’d gone off for a little bit and came back with a backstage pass, but there was only one. And I thought: ‘Shit. I love him so much that I want him to have it. Because it means so much to him. I can just wait in the bar.’ I was quite surprised at myself – I was only 22 and I was being quite mature. Then he grinned and held up a second pass.” Often, if you don’t remember things the same way, it adds texture to the memory. “There was a really bright, effervescent, easy feeling about being around each other,” Aled says. Jem disagrees: “It wasn’t easy at all. I felt absolutely tongue‑tied. I thought you were just so cool.” There can be a distinctive sweetness, a lack of consequence, to these memories. Abse says they “return you to a place, emotionally, prior to all the knocks and betrayals of life”. Kate and Jamie Laverty, both 44, have been married for 13 years and have two children, but they first dated in 1994, when they were 16. “Jamie joined my friend’s terrible indie band. He came on stage and I said: ‘Who’s he? He’s not in the band,’ and he heard me. That was so embarrassing.” Only 16-year-olds are capable of that exquisite cringing over moments that are really not that embarrassing. If celebrity relationships can crumble not because of incompatibility so much as the weight of public expectation, regular ones can fall apart simply because you don’t have much agency in that decade of transition – call it 15 to 25 – from childhood to adulthood. Jem was going back to art school and wasn’t looking to settle down; neither was Aled. Kate and Jamie talked about going to adjacent universities, but then she didn’t get into Manchester, he didn’t get into Oldham and nobody had a mobile phone. She says: “I was really excited about university and I thought it would be sad to be thinking about someone else and not being able to see them. I just thought it would be a rubbish experience. And I didn’t think we’d be married 25 years later.” Love is wasted on the young, because they don’t know anything. It is like giving a baby a mango – how are they supposed to know it is any more exotic than an apple? “There was a bit of a failure to recognise how brilliant our connection was – how rare and how precious,” Aled agrees. If what turns out to have been a really important relationship was discarded for a relatively trivial reason, you can try to pick it up again, but it is unlikely to be on friends-with-benefits terms. “I thought if we got back together it would be instantly a serious relationship,” says Kate. “You couldn’t casually date someone who was your first love 13 years earlier. And it was like that.” Jamie got back in touch with her via Facebook. “It came over quite quickly that he was thinking about the past,” she says. “If someone in online dating had sent these messages to me, three messages in, that would have been a red flag. But because I already knew him so well …” He came over for dinner and they were pretty much engaged before she produced the noodles (well, within six months). “It definitely felt romantic, it definitely felt like this was meant to be: this person from my past has swept back into my life.” Jem and Aled started messaging privately on Twitter when, Aled says, “we were both just out of relationships where we were not treated as well as we might have been”. They didn’t meet for months, as Jem was living abroad with two children, but they were messaging constantly, Jem remembers: “Once, we counted 200 messages in a day.” Aled adds: “It was so intense; I wasn’t sure you were real. I thought I might have a split personality and discover a second phone somewhere.” They finally met when Jem came to England to visit him. “It was like a 90s romcom,” Aled says. “The PA in the airport was playing Be My Baby.” Jem adds: “It was very difficult to make eye contact at first. It’s like young love with the brakes off, because you know who you are.” Aled says there was a “weird intensity to it”. “You’ve got all the fizz of new love that has really blossomed, but you’ve also got this deep, anchoring weight, the trust, the familiarity, the integrity of really knowing who that person is,” he says. By the time they resumed their relationship, Jem was identifying as non-binary. “But I’d always known that – the only difference was that I now had a vocabulary and context for what I’d always felt,” they say. Aled adds: “It was more like: ‘Now there’s a name for that thing that’s always been true.’ It’s not like they’d converted to Christianity.” Part of the instantaneous trust – which would probably be an illusion, a mirage or at least a punt in a regular love affair – is knowing the central pillars of each other’s lives, says Abse: “‘I know where you come from, I knew your mum and dad, I remember where you lived.’” All of that is great, but now you have to see each other’s parents again for the first time since you were a kid – and maybe one of you (Jamie, say) used to have long hair and is now bald. “It was weird getting back together and seeing his family again, but his parents were so warm; I could do no wrong,” says Kate. “It didn’t hurt that his mum really didn’t like his ex. She wouldn’t even say her name – it was always ‘her’. And I was the reason he’d moved back nearer to them, rather than living in the Midlands with her.” Jem’s dad, meanwhile, had leaned over to their mum in the middle of their first wedding and said: “It ought to be Aled,” but they found this out only when they got back together. “There was only one person who was surprised and that was an ex of both of ours,” Jem says. A quick corrective, before this all becomes too panglossian: life changes don’t always make us better at relationships. “There’s always the quest for the new when you’re young,” Abse says. “Twenty years later, you might think: ‘I’ve had a look round – it’s really nice back home.’” The flip side of this is that you may be set in your ways – as Carol found when she got back together with her former flame Steve in 2014. By this point, she had two children and “was definitely in love with him. I was mid-40s, thinking: ‘It would be lovely to have another baby.’” At this point in our video call, her 19-year-old daughter is making an internationally recognised hand signal for “crazy” behind her. “He was late 40s, had never had children and was completely freaked out by just how structured life with kids is; how much things have to be planned.” When they were having their breakup chat, he raised an incident he had found problematic – when she hadn’t been able to go to a gig on the day of her daughter’s birthday party. “He was never going to get priority and, in good faith, he just didn’t understand that. I thought: ‘My God, if I’d known you didn’t understand that I had to be there for that, I would never have got into this.’” Perhaps reunited couples who do work out are aware of how much could have gone wrong – they seem to be much more expressive in their gratitude to the universe. As J-Lo said recently, comparing this iteration of Bennifer with the one two decades ago: “There’s more of an appreciation and a celebration for it, which is nice.

4/26/2022,"More than a quarter of British Netflix subscribers allow their friends and family to use their accounts, with at least 17m homes estimated to be password sharing across the embattled streaming platform’s biggest markets in Europe. Netflix announced plans to crack down on the practice as one of a number of strategic moves designed to stem investor panic after it had more than $60bn (£47bn) wiped off its market value last week when it reported its first loss of subscribers in a decade. The world’s biggest streaming service, which expects its 221 million global subscriber base to shrink by millions more when it reports its next set of results covering April to June, has estimated that about 100m homes that pay for its service globally share their passwords with others. In the UK at least 27% of Netflix’s estimated 14.9 million subscribers, more than 4m accounts, allow other households to use their accounts to watch shows from Bridgerton to Stranger Things for free, according to the research firm Digital i, which said the true figure is almost certainly higher. “Our estimates came from analysing account activity, and we corroborated this with various other sources,” said Ali Vahdati, the Digital i chief executive. “That said, we still believe our results to slightly underestimate the [actual] incidence of password sharing.” Its analysis revealed that account sharing is most prevalent among younger Netflix fans, with at least 29% of 18- to 24-year-old UK subscribers doing so. This compares with a more moderate 18% of 45- to 54-year-olds. The research found that in Netflix’s five biggest European markets – the UK, Germany, Spain, France and Italy – a “minimum” of 17 million subscriber households share their passwords. The Spanish have proved to be the most prolific sharers, at 47% of subscribers, followed by Germany (42%), France (35%) and Italy (33%). The UK, Netflix’s biggest European market by some distance, has the lowest level of password sharing of the five. A decade of barnstorming growth had previously led Netflix to take a lenient approach to password sharing, with the company’s co-founder and co-chief executive Reed Hastings stating it had “no plans” to crack down on the practice. “Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with because there’s so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids,” he said, speaking in 2016. “So there’s no bright line, and we’re doing fine as is.” However, a combination of Netflix nearing saturation in many of its biggest markets, rising competition from rivals such as Amazon and Disney+ and a string of price increases has put pressure on the company’s growth, prompting the management to change its tune. “When we were growing fast [password sharing] was not a high priority, but now we’re working super hard on it,” Hastings said at the company’s financial update last week. Last month, Netflix began a trial charging subscribers in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru – password sharing is particularly high in Latin America – $2 to $3 a month to add up to two extra profiles outside their household to their account. The UK streaming boom ground to a halt in the first quarter this year. Last week, research from Kantar showed that the number of UK homes that have at least one paid-for subscription streaming service fell by 215,000, ending a decade of uninterrupted growth as households cut budgets to cope with the cost of living crisis. The research found that the proportion of consumers planning to cancel at least one video streaming service stating the reason as “wanting to save money” has hit an all-time high of 38%.",News/Media,More than a quarter of Netflix’s UK subscribers share passwords,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/26/netflix-uk-subscribers-share-passwords-streaming
4/26/2022,"A 12-year-old autistic girl from the Philippines has been barred from moving to New Zealand with her parents under immigration policies that reject people with disability or illness who may present a high cost to the health system. The rules have been called “discriminatory” and “ableist” by advocates calling for reform. Arianna Alfonzo, 12, has had to remain in the Philippines for the past six years while her father, Allan, works in Christchurch where he has a carpet-laying business. Both he and Arianna’s mother, Gail Alfonzo, have residency status in New Zealand. But Arianna’s applications to come to New Zealand have been denied. The case, first reported by the New Zealand Herald, is one of hundreds rejected under New Zealand’s rules, which set a $41,000 limit over five years on an immigrant’s cost to the health system. The criteria exclude people with a number of “high-cost” conditions including physical disability, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorders, brain injury, multiple sclerosis and cancers. Arianna’s mother, Gail Alfonzo, said the family had spent thousands on specialists and lawyers to try to prove their family unit would not be a burden on New Zealand. She wrote in a public plea for support that her husband “is a hardworking person and trustworthy, he is a good citizen and abides by New Zealand law. We are in our early 40s and we are very sure both of us will contribute [to] the growth and economy of New Zealand.” “Like any other child, Arianna deserves to live with dignity and be treated fairly,” she said. “Arianna deserves to have a complete and happy family.” The New Zealand Green party MP Ricardo Menéndez March, who has advocated for the Alfonzo family, called the system “a deeply dehumanising process which strips them of their human rights and makes them plead in the media and to MPs to simply be seen as the whole human beings that we all are”. March said he was aware of about 400 residency visas that had been declined on the basis of people not meeting the health conditions. “In my view, New Zealand is far behind some comparable jurisdictions,” he said. March said he had written to the associate immigration minister Phil Twyford asking him to reassess the Alfonzo case. That request was denied. A spokesperson for Twyford’s office said he was not able to comment on individual cases. The Alfonzo family is not the first high-profile case of prospective immigrants being rejected for their disability. Juliana Carvalho was initially rejected on similar grounds – she has lupus and is paraplegic. Carvalho spent seven years challenging the decision, and said it took an enormous toll. “Honestly the emotional toll was worse than becoming paraplegic, in terms of mental health and suffering … This whole messaging that all you are [is] a burden, that you add no value – it has a huge impact on someone’s life,” she said. After beginning her time in New Zealand under a student visa, it took six years before Carvahlo was approved for residency. “I am a very resourceful person with amazing friends, family, I have the support, and for me it was almost unbearable,” Carvalho said. “Now imagine for a child with a disability, who is building their identity – what is the impact of this messaging for children? And what is the impact of this messaging for all the other children with disabilities in this country?” In 2021, Carvalho presented a 35,000-person petition to have the rules changed. This March, however, the government said it would not review the current criteria. “The current settings are not specifically discriminatory against disabled people, but instead focus on assessing the public health impact an individual will have,” said a government statement. “The government values the contribution that disabled people bring to society and is always willing to take steps towards making New Zealand a non-disabling society. However, as this goal pertains to the current Acceptable Standard of Health (ASH) immigration settings, the government considers these settings appropriate.”",News/World news,New Zealand denies entry to autistic daughter of immigrant couple,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/new-zealand-denies-entry-to-autistic-daughter-of-immigrant-couple
4/26/2022,"One of the most senior US officials in the Pacific has refused to rule out military action against Solomon Islands if it were to allow China to establish a military base there, saying that the security deal between the countries presented “potential regional security implications” for the US and other allies. Ambassador Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, was part of a high-level US delegation to the Pacific country last week. He said the US team, which also included the National Security Council coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs, Kurt Campbell, had a 90-minute “constructive and candid” meeting with prime minister Manasseh Sogavare in which the US team detailed concerns about its recently signed security deal with China. “We wanted to outline for our friends in the Solomons, what our concerns are,” said Kritenbrink. “Prime minister Sogavare indicated that in the Solomon Islands’ view, the agreement they’ve concluded has solely domestic implications. But we’ve made clear that there are potential regional security implications of the agreement not just for ourselves, but for allies and partners across the region.” On Tuesday, Kritenbrink reiterated the US’s willingness to act in the region if a military base were established by China. “Of course, we have respect for the Solomon Islands sovereignty, but we also wanted to let them know that if steps were taken to establish a de facto permanent military presence, power projection capabilities, or a military installation, then we would have significant concerns, and we would very naturally respond to those concerns,” he said. When asked what that response could involve, he said: “Look, I’m not going to speculate and I’m not in a position to talk about what the United States may or may not do in such a situation.” Pressed on whether he would rule out the prospect of the US taking military action against Solomon Islands were a naval base to be established, and, if not, whether he was comfortable with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s talk of the base being a “red line” for Australia, he said: “I don’t have a lot to add beyond what I’ve already stated.” In a statement last week, the Biden administration said the US would “respond accordingly” if China was allowed to establish a long-term presence on the islands, while noting assurances from Sogavare that he had no intention of allowing a military base. The rhetoric escalated in the wake of the statement, with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, saying Australia had “the same red line” as the US when it came to China’s involvement in Solomon Islands, and defence minister Peter Dutton using his Anzac Day address on Monday to declare: “Australia should prepare for war”, claiming that China was “on a very deliberate course at the moment”. Kritenbrink also noted China’s military ambitions, saying: “I think it’s important in this context, to keep in mind that we do know that the PRC [People’s Republic of China] is seeking to establish a more robust overseas logistics and basic infrastructure that would allow the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] to project and sustain military power at greater distances. So we wanted to have that candid conversation with our friends in the Solomons. We outlined our concerns … and we’ve indicated that we’ll continue to monitor the situation closely and continue to engage with them going forward.” The text of the security deal which was signed by China and Solomon Islands is secret, though Solomon Islands MPs have called for the prime minister to release it publicly. “I think it’s clear that only a handful of people in a very small circle have seen this agreement. And the prime minister himself has been quoted publicly as saying he would only share the details with China’s permission, which I think is a source of concern as well,” said Kritenbrink. However, a draft of the deal was leaked on social media last month and contained provisions permitting China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”. Kritenbrink said that “the United States of America is not in the business of asking countries to choose between the United States and China or anyone else”. But that it is interested in promoting “a proactive vision for again the shared interests and principles that we believe are vital to all of our friends across the region”.",News/World news,US won’t rule out military action if China establishes base in Solomon Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/us-wont-rule-out-military-action-if-china-establishes-base-in-solomon-islands
4/26/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has tried to play down divisions within the Coalition over its commitment to net zero by 2050, saying it is “absolutely” the government’s policy. Labor criticised the “spectacular” split between inner-city Liberals and rural Nationals on the policy, criticising the Coalition for running a “fear campaign” on the opposition’s policy around coal jobs. The Liberal National party’s candidate for the Queensland seat of Flynn, Colin Boyce, said on Monday that there was “wiggle room” in the commitment to net zero, calling it a “flexible plan” that was not legislated. But speaking in the marginal seat of Herbert on Tuesday, Morrison said Boyce had since “clarified” he was talking about the pathway to net zero, not the target itself. “Our commitment to net zero by 2050 is a commitment of the Australian government that I made in Glasgow,” he said. “It is the government’s absolute policy. “What he [Boyce] was referring to was our pathway to it and as technologies change and improve, then, of course, we’re going to get there and we’re going to get there by the best method possible.” Morrison, who on Tuesday announced a $70m hydrogen hub for Townsville, tried to paint Labor’s commitment to a carbon credits scheme under the safeguard mechanism as a revived “carbon tax” that would hit the mining sector. “Just be clear, it not only affects the coal industry, it affects mining and oil and gas production,” Morrison said. “It affects rail freight, it affects cement production, it affects fuel refining, and many other sectors are caught up in those arrangements, which would see them penalised and taxed.” The safeguard mechanism, introduced by the Abbott government, requires 215 large polluters in Australia to keep their emissions below a certain level or face a penalty. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was pushed by 2GB radio host Ray Hadley on Tuesday to reiterate the same pledge once uttered by former prime minister Julia Gillard, that “there will be no carbon tax, ever” under a government he leads. Labor has said that the government’s existing policy is not being properly implemented and has vowed to strengthen the plan, gradually ratcheting down the allowable emissions in a bid to reduce pollution. But there was confusion over the weekend when Labor’s shadow climate spokesperson, Chris Bowen, told Channel Nine that coalmines would be included in the plan, after the shadow assistant climate spokesperson, Pat Conroy, had said they would not be included. Bowen said industries like coal would work with the Clean Energy Regulator to find a “sensible pathway” to reducing emissions. The Coalition rounded on the safeguards changes, with a Nationals spokesperson saying in a statement to the Australian Financial Review that Labor’s plan had “sounded the death knell for the coal industry”. Coalition senator Matt Canavan, who has spent time campaigning in the coal-rich Hunter region, accused local Labor politicians – including Conroy, the MP for Shortland – of having been “caught out lying to their constituents” over the mines. Canavan, a longtime critic of the Coalition’s net zero plan, called for the environmental policy to be scrapped, claiming “none of this is binding on us, and nor should it be”. “We should be following [British prime minister] Boris Johnson and pausing our net zero commitment given the aggression of China in our region,” Canavan told Sky News. “There is no need for us to focus on this now with a clear and present danger in front of us.” Hours before Morrison’s hydrogen announcement, Canavan said “we don’t need hydrogen” and called for the government to back the construction of the Collinsville coal power station. At a press conference in Darwin, Conroy shot back at Canavan’s attacks. He explained that Labor’s policy made dispensation for industries like coal which faced international competitors who weren’t subject to such environmental controls in their own countries. “The coalmining industry will not suffer a disadvantage or a negative impact compared to the international competitors,” Conroy said. “That’s further confirmed by our independent and comprehensive economic modelling that made it very clear that … not a single coalmine would close early because of our policy, and not a single coalmining job would be lost because of our policy.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said there was a “spectacular” split between the Nationals and Liberals on their own net zero policy. “The deputy prime minister is backing in his candidate in Flynn saying their net zero emissions commitment by 2050 is optional, that there’s wiggle room and it’s not binding,” Conroy said. “Then we have the members for North Sydney and Wentworth saying that it is binding. “I haven’t seen a bigger split in climate change since Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister. People should be focusing on this.” Albanese had earlier defended Labor’s climate plans, trying to tamp down the Coalition attacks. “The safeguards mechanism was the one introduced by Tony Abbott,” Albanese told 2GB. “It applies to exactly the same companies, not to one company more.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison forced to clarify net zero commitment amid Coalition division,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/scott-morrison-forced-to-clarify-net-zero-commitment-amid-coalition-division
