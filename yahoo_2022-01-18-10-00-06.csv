1/18/2022,"Oklahoma pastor Mike Todd apologized for rubbing his spit on a person's face during a service. The original video went viral and garnered negative attention on social media. Todd said his actions were a ""distraction"" from his message. A pastor at a megachurch based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, apologized on Twitter for rubbing his spit on a member of his church as captured in a viral video. Pastor Michael Todd, who is one of the lead pastors at Transformation Church, said in a video that his demonstration during a sermon was ""disgusting"" and a ""distraction"" after watching back footage from the service. ""I was trying to make the word come alive,"" he said of the video in which he spits on his hand twice before rubbing a man's face on stage in front of congregants. Just before spitting on his hand, Todd said, ""Receiving vision from God might get nasty."" The man on stage next to Todd was identified as his brother Brentom Todd, according to Tulsa World. In the video, there is an audible gasp from the audience, to which Todd responds, ""How you just reacted is how the people in your life will react when God is doing what it takes for the miracle."" Todd's apology came after negative reactions to the initial video, which spread across the internet. ""It's never my intention to distract others from God's Word and the message of Jesus… even with illustrations!"" Todd wrote on Twitter. ""I apologize for my example being too extreme and disgusting! I Love Everybody."" ""I truly understand now why the elders used to frequently tell us that we're in the last days,"" Atlantic columned Jemele Hill tweeted. Some social media posters pointed out how Todd's actions might be especially unwise during a pandemic. ""What is the CDC going to do about Mike Todd?"" one tweet read. In the follow-up video, Todd says that he hopes people who saw the viral video will watch the rest of the message to hear the points he was making.

1/18/2022,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — For decades renowned Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez kept the public from knowing about an intimate aspect of his life: He had a daughter with a Mexican writer, with whom he had an extramarital affair in the early 1990s. The closely guarded secret was published by Colombian newspaper El Universal on Sunday and confirmed to the Associated Press by two relatives of the Nobel Prize-winning author, who is famous for novels like One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera. Márquez died in Mexico City in 2014, where thousands of his readers lined up to see his casket in a concert hall. He was married for more than five decades to Mercedes Barcha and the couple had two children named Rodrigo and Gonzalo. They lived in Mexico City for much of their lives. El Universal said that in the early 1990s Márquez had a daughter with Susana Cato, a writer and journalist who worked with Márquez on two movie scripts and who also interviewed him for a 1996 magazine story. Cato and Marquez named their daughter Indira: She is now in her early 30s and uses her mother’s surname. Shani García Márquez, one of the writer’s nieces, told the AP that she had known for years about her cousin Indira, but had not mentioned her to the media because her parents always asked her to be discrete about her uncle’s personal life. Gabriel Eligio Torres García, who is also a nephew of the Colombian writer, said he has been in touch with Indira Cato through social media, though he has never met her in person. “My cousins Rodrigo and Gonzalo told me about her casually during a reunion,” he said. Other members of García Márquez’s family, cited by El Universal, said they had not spoken about the writer’s daughter previously out of “respect” for Mercedes Barcha who died in August 2020. Torres García said that Indira Cato’s mother, Susana, had also been discrete about her daughter’s lineage, to keep her away from the media spotlight. Indira Cato is now a documentary producer in Mexico City. She won several awards for a 2014 documentary on migrants passing through Mexico. García Márquez’ family said they didn’t want to share her contact information because they were not authorized to do so, and the AP could not contact Indira Cato independently. “She leads a very artistic lifestyle, like many people in this family,” said Shani García. “It makes us very happy that she has shined on her own.”",World/Associated Press,Colombian author García Márquez had secret Mexican daughter,https://news.yahoo.com/colombian-author-garc-m-rquez-224159615.html
