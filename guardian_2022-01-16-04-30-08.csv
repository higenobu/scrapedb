1/16/2022,"Pep Guardiola watched his Manchester City team take a firm stride towards the Premier League title with a 1-0 home win over Chelsea but said they had already given him something more priceless – a remorseless dedication to succeed in every game. Kevin De Bruyne scored the winning goal with a curler from distance and it meant that City moved 13 points clear of their second-placed opponents. Liverpool are 14 points back in third with two matches in hand and go to the Etihad Stadium on 9 April.  Guardiola was at pains to stress that a fourth title in five seasons was not yet secure but he was delighted at how his team were able to clear the latest obstacle in front of them. “I don’t know what is going to happen this season,” he said. “I don’t care. What I care about is that after winning what we have won in the last years, still these guys in every single game give everything for this club. This is so difficult to find in modern life, in modern football. “We are humble enough to run without the ball, to try to do our best in every single game. This is my – and our – biggest achievement as a club and as a team by far. To win and win and win for years and still being there all the time, in this country and in this league. This is the biggest title I have and will have when I leave Manchester.” Guardiola denied that complacency could become a problem for City. “I know my players, we are together for six seasons – [I know] how they celebrate the good moments and suffer in the bad ones, so they are going to listen that it is not true when the people say it is over. In January it is impossible it is over.” The Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, was unhappy at the performance of his attacking players, including the club’s record signing, Romelu Lukaku, who missed a one-on-one chance early in the second half. Chelsea were wasteful with their final pass, particularly in the first quarter of the game. “Sometimes he needs to do the service,” Tuchel said. “He had many ball losses without any pressure, many ball losses in very promising circumstances, without any pressure. He had a huge chance so he is included in this. “We want to serve him but he is part of the team and the performance up front. Especially in the first half we can do much, much better and we need to do much, much better. We had a lot of transition chances in the first half.”",Sport/Football,"City players’ dedication to winning is more valuable than title, says Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/city-players-dedication-to-winning-is-more-valuable-than-title-says-guardiola
1/16/2022,"A little over a month ago, the prime minister told the House of Commons that he shared the anger of a nation at seeing a video of his Number 10 staff making light of lockdown measures and joking about Christmas parties. We were supposed to believe that a culture of impunity and disregard for rules at the heart of government had absolutely nothing to do with Boris Johnson; that he was as shocked by the hypocrisy as the rest of us. It was always a ludicrous contention that the prime minister had no idea what was going on in his own office, part of the same complex as his own residence. And in the last week the full extent of the sheer gall of a leader prepared to throw his staff under a bus to evade accountability for the worst sort of political hypocrisy has been exposed.  Revelation after revelation has emerged since the start of the year – as Johnson must have known they inevitably would – that rubbishes that statement he made to MPs last month. We now know that in May 2020, Johnson was giving a speech at a social gathering, with drink and food, in the Downing Street garden the very same evening ministers were warning the public at a press conference that they could only meet one other person outside. That his staff were throwing not one, but two, raucous parties that reportedly left items in the garden damaged the night before Prince Philip’s funeral. And that Downing Street staff regularly held drinks parties on Fridays that Johnson would often drop into, giving them the prime ministerial seal of approval. The Observer has long believed Johnson to be a man of little integrity, but even so, it is hard not to be shocked at the level of contempt in which he so clearly holds parliament and the public. Imagine the consequences if he had misled a court under oath in this way. But to him, it is just the Commons, just the way he approaches politics and every other aspect of his professional life. It is clear that the view of the Covid rules as optional rather than mandatory, as they were for everyone else in the country, did not stop at the doors of No 10. There were parties and leaving drinks at other government departments. But there is no doubt where this culture emanated from: it started from the very top, with the prime minister. It is extraordinary that those who wrote the law and the guidance flouted it, as almost everyone else, including the Queen, observed it for the sake of public health, even while mourning. For those who did not, there were hefty fines, even for people with far more sympathetic stories than those working in No 10. One teenager was fined hundreds of pounds for organising an outdoor balloon release for his friend who had died and had to go to court to contest a further £10,000 fine issued in error by Durham constabulary. Two weeks into the new year, Johnson’s authority has been comprehensively shredded. He cannot stay in post. But the Conservative party cannot wipe the slate clean by electing a new leader. Everything about Johnson’s dreadful premiership has been entirely predictable, a reflection of the man he so clearly was long before he became prime minister. He was sacked from a job in journalism in the 1980s for fabricating quotes for a newspaper story and from the Conservative shadow frontbench in the early 2000s for lying about an affair. As chair of the Leave campaign, he was complicit in its false claims that leaving the EU would free up £350m a week for the NHS – later ruled a misuse of official statistics by the UK Statistics Authority – and that a vote to remain in the EU was a vote to share a border with Iraq and Syria. As mayor of London, he failed to declare his personal interests, including his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, whose company received thousands of pounds of public money. It was patently obvious what sort of prime minister he would be; no one could credibly argue that there was a senior Tory less well suited to govern Britain. Yet Conservative MPs still crowned him leader in 2019. Enough of them thought he cared too little about the union, allowing him to ruthlessly pursue a hard Brexit and that his loose-with-the-truth style of campaigning could win them a general election in the same way it did the EU referendum. An incompetent, corrupt and rotten prime minister was the bargain they were prepared to make, the cost they were all too willing to impose on the whole country. What a heavy price Britain has paid. On Covid, the government is trying to use the success of the vaccine programme to detract from the growing political crisis in which it finds itself. It is true that the UK has had a more successful vaccine rollout than many other countries, and that the government, particularly Kate Bingham, who chaired the taskforce, deserves credit for the early investment in vaccine technology. But the government’s overall record on Covid is grim: time and again, during the first 15 months of the pandemic, Johnson failed to learn from previous mistakes and acted to introduce restrictions too slowly, undoubtedly resulting in thousands of avoidable deaths and more economic pain. First, the government’s hapless approach to education during a pandemic means that far too little has been done to mitigate its impact on children. The effects of this will be felt long into the future. Second, on Brexit, Johnson achieved the hard Brexit the ideological crusaders from his party’s right flank wanted. But it has come at a huge cost: a long-term economic cost, which will depress Britain’s growth prospects for many years to come, but also a perilous risk to the integrity of the union that cannot be measured in pounds and pence and which may mean that within a couple of decades the United Kingdom may no longer even exist. Who cares if the hardest of Brexits offers succour to the cause of Scottish independence? And faced with the irresolvable conundrum of Brexit – that there can be no clean break from the EU while avoiding the need for a customs border either on the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea – Johnson has chosen simply to pretend this problem does not exist, rather than confront the fact that he or his successor will have to choose between rejecting regulatory alignment between the EU and parts of the UK or stability in Northern Ireland. The disregard for the union permeates everything this government does, extending to ministers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg insulting Scottish Conservatives in a way that only plays into the independence campaign’s hands. Third, all over Britain, families are suffering as a result of this government’s policies. Johnson won his majority by promising not only to get Brexit done, but to “level up” the country. That was just empty rhetoric: his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has continued the approach of his predecessors since 2010, introducing the biggest ever one-off benefit cut, on top of the last decade’s tax credit cuts that have seen some low-income parents lose thousands of pounds a year even as more affluent families have had their tax bills reduced. Refugees fleeing war zones and human rights abuses have found themselves at the sharp end of a culture war with Priti Patel’s Home Office. Finally, the last few weeks of revelations about Johnson’s hypocrisy on Covid do not just damage the Conservative party. Like the expenses scandal more than a decade ago, it undermines public trust in all politicians and the legitimacy of our democratic institutions. It makes a mockery of the rule of law when ordinary citizens are punished for breaking the law, but senior politicians, political aides and civil servants appear to neatly sidestep the consequences. Every day Johnson continues as prime minister, the damage he does grows. As his evolution from electoral asset to electoral liability dawns on his party, it is looking increasingly likely that they will not allow him to continue in office for much longer. But Britain’s political crisis will not be over. The choice of the next prime minister would fall to Conservative MPs and party members. Johnson’s likely successors are all complicit in the government’s dreadful track record. The only hope lies in a renewed Labour party winning the next general election. Keir Starmer has emerged from recent weeks as a man of competence, integrity and values. Labour still has a long way to go in addressing the reasons why it lost voters in 2019 and communicating what a Starmer premiership would achieve for Britain, but they are advancing from the terrible defeat Jeremy Corbyn led them to then. Prime minister Boris Johnson is a creation of the modern Conservative party. Tory MPs propelled this charlatan to No 10 entirely because it suited their narrow interests, with no regard for the consequences for the country. It is extraordinary how little contrition many of those who backed him have shown. Johnson’s resignation is not enough: the Conservative party itself must be held accountable for his disastrous premiership.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Boris Johnson hurting the country and shaming his party | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/15/the-observer-view-on-boris-johnson-contempt-for-the-truth
1/16/2022,"Dancing to the Wiggles was one of the things that helped Clare Fletcher get through isolation with a baby to look after. Water play on the balcony, reading books and horsing around all helped too, although the Sydney mother of Dorothy (Dot, 20 months) said a week in a two-bedroom apartment was harder than she expected.  Fletcher and her husband, David Dewey, (both 37, both double vaccinated) went to the US for Christmas so Dewey’s family could meet Dot. After having a “bit of a shock” at testing delays here, eventually they got hold of rapid antigen tests and found they were positive. Dot was coughing, too. Australians have had plenty of experience with lockdowns (some more than others), but until recently, only relatively few have had to isolate because they have Covid or are close contacts of someone who does. This week more than 640,000 people have tested positive. That surge coincides with supply shortages across the nation, as supermarket shelves are emptied of chicken, fresh fruit and vegetables and other essentials. Rapid antigen tests, paracetamol and other Covid-related health goods are also hard to find. Fletcher counts herself lucky. The family had only mild illnesses, and friends pitched in when they started running out of things. “I’d put in an order for nappies and baby stuff – that went unfilled for a week,” she says. “It just sat in processing. We were about to run out, but I did a callout to my Mums’ WhatsApp group. “I hope I can pay that forward to anyone else in the group if they are in that situation.” Then there are the trials and tribulations of looking after a small child while confined. “It was good to have two parents at home,” she says. “But I would say for anyone in the same situation, don’t expect to be able to work.” With even some politicians saying “we’re all going to get” Covid, Australians who have not already experienced isolation are preparing for their stint. There is clear guidance from GPs on how to look after yourself at home after a positive diagnosis. The federal health department has advice on how to manage isolation in a shared house. But advice from authorities often fails to take shortages into account, and cannot account for the diversity of human habitats. The health department’s advice suggests people who share a house with an infected person should stay elsewhere if possible and use a separate bathroom if available – options that are clearly not viable for many people. That leaves households trying to come up with their own solutions. In the UK, the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, took himself off to what sounds like his garden shed. A Melbourne man confined to his room had to use a bucket for a toilet. Some are using tents to remove an infected person from a household. South Australia’s health department came under fire for using tents to house Aboriginal homeless people who were close contacts in an outbreak. On the other hand, even before Omicron, doctors were warning that overcrowding in regional Aboriginal communities was a “massive problem” and that tents could be part of the solution. Communities that are themselves isolated are hard to isolate in. There are plenty of examples of uninfected people leaving plates of food at the bedroom door of someone who’s isolating. In India, people were forced to isolate in treehouses. Performer Paul McDermott was among those who took issue with advice that presumed people were privileged enough to be able to easily keep separate, after he was advised to use a different toilet. The en-fucking-suite? I had to inform my phone-in Covid helper we all use the same toilet in this house, there’s no hiding from each other, we can’t prepare meals in the spare kitchen or hide out for two weeks in the servants quarters. We are in it together. So… Former politician Dr Jane Lomax-Smith has thought ahead to what isolation would look like in her Adelaide home. She says she has a “respectful and informed relationship to major diseases and death”. “Two years ago I repurposed a long-gone son’s bedroom and adjacent bathroom as the ‘quarantine station’ with an oximeter, thermometer and basic drugs. “Should we become sick, the phone charger and basics will be ready to go. This week I replaced batteries in all the devices and added a pack of spares to the supplies.” She says she’s lucky to have the space. “I can’t imagine how one could manage with a large household and a couple of essential workers.” Disability advocate Sam Paior, who set up The Growing Space in SA, has been working with her sons Ben, who has Down’s syndrome, and Bailey to organise home kits for people with disabilities who contract Covid. They have been driving all over the state trying to source oximeters, thermometers, and other gear to go in a pack with masks, electrolytes, sanitiser and so on. The plan was to sell some kits to fund others for people with disabilities, who may not be able to source their own isolation necessities. The shortages have made that plan tough. “If we could do this again, what I’d do is have everyone who wants a kit pay for one, then the minute someone is positive, they get it delivered. Pay in advance so we can get them together and send them out as they’re needed, and when this shit is over, if you didn’t need one, you’ll get your money back.

1/16/2022,"The first things that fell out of Alexander Downer’s suitcase were some fishnets. In late 2015, when Downer was UK high commissioner and living in London with his wife, Nicky, they decided to sell his late parents’ South Australian mansion, Martinsell, and auction all the contents.  Mahogany furniture, silver, crystal, a rare Hans Heysen painting, all went under the hammer. Heysen’s Gums in the Mist fetched $24,000, according to the Advertiser. A Ming Dynasty jar went for $800. Among the pile of stuff on the auction website the following year was a stack of six suitcases. I was moving house and wanted some hipster-type storage. I had previously bought a marvellous old steamer trunk that belonged to Montgomery Clift (or so I was told), and was thinking some vintage suitcases for old papers and photos and mixtapes would be just the ticket. I bought them for $300, a motley collection of mostly old brown leather luggage. One had a tag that read “Fly TAA the Friendly Way”, with “Alexander Downer: Department of Foreign Affairs” scrawled under it. Another had an Ansett tag; yet another, old shipping stickers. Another was embossed with his mother’s name: Lady Mary Downer. Unfortunately, the auction lot did not include his famous and loyal bright yellow suitcase. That one, bought by his wife to stand out on a carousel, was crushed by baggage handlers. I had assumed the cases would be empty. I thought I’d just chuck a bunch of old tax returns in them, and stack them up in an appealingly shabby way in a corner somewhere. They were not empty. When they arrived, I found they were overflowing with quaint old dress-up clothes. Or were they real clothes, for tiny people? Beautifully made shoes and jackets. One cute naval jacket with “Georgina” scrawled inside the lapel. There were dolls. A veritable bevy of creepy dolls in various states of disrepair. Was that … real human hair? One of them had eyes that seemed to follow you. Well, one eye anyway. Another was bald, with mildew stubble. There were letters and brochures, but no secret cabinet documents. No minutes from that meeting with George Papadopoulos, former Donald Trump adviser. Most of the stuff in there, Downer says, probably belonged to his sister, Una. The cases looked as though they had been used – as I had planned to use them – for storage. The suitcase equivalent of junk drawers. Martinsell, an hour out of Adelaide in the Barossa valley, was Sir Alick and Lady Mary Downer’s country home. Downer says the family decided on a clearance auction after his mother died, but that mistakes were made. A book Sir Alick had written during the second world war, when he was a prisoner of war at Changi, was accidentally scooped up with other “valueless” books. Sir Alick was a lawyer before the war, and a politician after it, and was the first Downer to become a UK high commissioner. “We wanted to keep [the book] in the family archives, but because of the mistake, for which we are responsible, there’s nothing legally we can do about it,” Alexander Downer said at the time. On the phone this month from London, Downer says it ended up at the National War Memorial, a good home. (He is now the executive chairman of King’s College London’s international school for government.) The bag with the TAA tag probably goes back to the 1970s, he says, when he was a Dfat junior officer. I recently donated the cases to a charity auction. They were good dinner party patter, but those dolls were a little creepy, and I didn’t really have the room for my hipster suitcase tower. Spruiking the wares, I hinted that the suitcases may have contained a certain type of stocking.

1/16/2022,"During a sunny afternoon on the last Thursday in December, the women’s final of the Afghan National Cup was played on a state-of-the-art Sydney football field in front of a rapturous crowd. The soccer tournament has become an institution for the more than 70,000 members of the Afghan Australian community, serving as a bookend to the year for the past 15 years. This time the cup drew about 650 players representing 34 teams, following qualifiers in major cities including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, and spectators from across the country.  But the huge community event was marred by fighting, leading to the cancellation of the entire tournament on the third day after a man threatened to self-harm in protest at an opposing side fielding an unregistered player. Police were called and the event was in disarray after brawls on the field spilled into the car park of the Western Sydney Wanderers’ training grounds. Organisers scrambled to salvage the final day, getting the Wanderers to agree to host the games of the women’s side, and arranging an ad-hoc finale for the men. Players and spectators who spoke to Guardian Australia supported their decisions, saying the spirit of the event transcended the controversy. “I think football is a very, very big thing in our community,” says Nilofar Faveqi, captain of Sydney United, which lost the women’s final. “It’s something that we are very passionate about. And when it comes to things that we are passionate about, we are very vocal as well. Everyone wants to win. Everyone wants to be the best state. They’re passionate about winning. It is what it is.” It is a common refrain. People care deeply about this cup – more than any other competition, more than anything they watched on TV, more than anything else all year. “Every team wants to win this, it’s really big among the Afghans,” says Wahid Hamayoun, star player for Azadi, one of the Sydney men’s teams. “So many people come down, thousands of people. There are people that don’t even play, they travel interstate just to watch. “If you saw when this tournament first started, they only had 10 teams. Now they need to hold qualifiers in each state, it’s just huge.” In December, teams come together for a group stage and knockout competition in a chosen host city. This year Sydney organisers partnered with the Wanderers to hold the event at their training facilities. Teams have to fund their own travel and accommodation, but that doesn’t stop players bringing their friends and family, packing out the stands and making their presence felt during the matches. The tournament’s approximately 650 players were spread across 26 teams on the men’s side, and eight teams on the women’s side. According to the 2016 census, approximately 70,000 Australians were born in Afghanistan, with community numbers swelling in the time since. The first day felt like a celebration, with up to four games being played concurrently across the men’s and women’s sides of the tournament. The facility was flooded with young people, their fresh haircuts and shimmering sneakers gleaming in the sun, chanting songs about their team and their rivals. Coming after a turbulent year for the community, with many participants hailing from suburbs in Sydney or Melbourne that were hardest hit by the Delta wave, and with the fall of Kabul still fresh in the memories, it initially appeared to be a release valve for pent up emotions. But participants shrugged when asked if any of these issues played a part in the tournament’s popularity and the passion people had for it. Mohsen Hasani, a player for Melbourne FC and recent migrant himself, said it was far more about belonging and finding a safe space as a minority, a product of a diaspora creating and valuing their own spaces. “When you come to a country like Australia, as great as it is, there is heaps of obstacles as well. “But when you come to a tournament like this, and you see there is a lot of people that you can connect with, that have been through the same thing you’ve been through, it helps a lot.” Players spoke of their pride at winning in front of their community, how much it meant to be considered the best among the diaspora, how important it was that their own community witness their greatness. Hussain Ramazani, the tournament’s organiser, explained that identity and community were central to the tournament, intertwined with their collective experience of migration. “We’re here for the youth, firstly, but to also respect our culture and what it means to be Afghan. We celebrate our freedom, and we want the youth to understand what their background means. “We work for the young people, actually,” he continues. “They come to understand their background, to understand the value of their community. We’re here to know ourselves, and that is how we become an active, positive community here.” He explains the tournament’s profile has skyrocketed over time, with bragging rights growing along with its reach. Battle lines are drawn along state borders, almost arbitrary in their relevance, but enough of a difference to drive rivalries to extreme heights. Going into the event this year, Sydney team Azadi were the favourites on the men’s side. In the second group game, they won 4-0 against the Brisbane All Stars, easing into the knockout rounds. In the fallout of the game, and especially when it became obvious Brisbane would not be making the knockouts, the team complained that Azadi had fielded an unregistered player. Brisbane wanted the result made void, and for Azadi to be thrown out of the competition. The player was a reserve goalkeeper who took to the field for minutes, before the team was notified he wasn’t registered and took him off. But Brisbane wanted more, citing the rules they signed at the outset of the tournament, stipulating a team was disqualified if it fielded an unregistered player. Ramazani was left in a difficult position, initially agreeing that Azadi should be disqualified. But the decision sparked protests, pushing and shoving between teams and extensive diplomacy, with Ramazani then retracting the decision and deciding instead to have a replay. Brisbane were livid, refusing to back down from demanding Azadi be disqualified. In the car park, between brawls and debates, one man threatened to harm himself if the decision wasn’t reversed. Seeing the chaos and violence, the Wanderers pulled the plug, with police called to send everyone home. Ramazani says he spent the night in endless meetings, attempting to broker peace between the teams, and a resolution for the tournament. Azadi was ultimately ejected from the competition, with no replay ordered. It was decided the women’s side of the tournament would continue at the Wanderers facility, and that the men would hold an “unofficial” final day at a suburban ground, to crown a winner before the interstate teams had to head home. Teams from Melbourne won both the men’s and women’s side of the tournament, much to the chagrin of the Sydney contingent. The women’s final was resolved after a dramatic penalty shootout, while the mens final was won 2-1 by Melbourne United. The final for the women was the last “official” match of the tournament. Although spectators were restricted to just the families of the players, the crowd swelled as the game wore on, bringing out traditional drums and chanting for their team under a glorious Sydney sunset. It was almost like nothing had happened. And to many, the drama was just part and parcel of the event, an understanding of what was at stake. “We did this for ourselves, no one else,” Nooria Mohamed-Zia, captain of winners Melbourne United, says. “We lost the final for three years in a row, we’ve been thinking about this moment for three years and we finally did it. Nothing else matters.”",Sport/Sport,‘Nothing else matters’: the football event that enthrals (and now and then divides) Australia’s Afghan community ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/nothing-else-matters-the-football-event-that-enthrals-and-now-and-then-divides-australias-afghan-community
1/16/2022,"Summer holidaymakers continue to roll through the glitter strip at Surfers Paradise, even as the Gold Coast’s Omicron outbreak increases. It’s quiet for January, but tourists are still here, wandering between the hotels, the restaurants and the beach. A few streets back from the surf, the diminished workforce at the Paradise Resort is paddling furiously beneath the surface.  Last week, the resort’s sales and marketing team were cleaning rooms and turning down beds. Reservations staff were making coffees. Human resources employees have been shifted to the kitchen to clean tables. “There’s no such thing as a normal week at the moment,” says David Brook, the general manager of the Paradise Resort. In December, as tourism businesses on the Gold Coast prepared for the New South Wales-Queensland border reopening, bookings were strong. Brook says about 96% of available rooms were reserved. Cancellations due to the Omicron outbreak mean the hotel is only at about three-quarters capacity; most of the cancelled rooms have been shut off, due to staffing concerns. There are now more than 21,000 Covid cases on the Gold Coast, in addition to thousands more close contacts required to isolate, and the city’s tourism workforce has been seriously affected. “We’ve reached a cycle stage. Staff have got Covid or become a close contact, they’ve had to be off for five days and they’re returning as others go off. It’s been really tough, but we’re getting through it,” says Brook. “Anything where there are high labour costs – and that’s our industry – it’s being affected a huge amount. That’s especially true for the small tour operators, surf classes, jetski places. If they lose two or three staff, that’s their business shut down.” Some of the larger hotels on the Gold Coast have had trouble getting fresh linen, as workers at third-party contractors who wash and replace bedding have been affected by the Covid wave. At the Big4 Gold Coast Holiday Park, the general manager, Andrew Hewitt, has been doing shifts in the kitchen. Last week he made the “previously unspeakable” decision to close the cafe for dinner service. “We’re in the second year of this now. We’ve done a lot of things that were unprecedented in the last 24 months,” Hewitt says. He says tourism operators had been aware of the challenge Covid outbreaks could pose once the state borders opened. “If anyone thought this season was going to be a walk in the park, of course it wasn’t. I told my family: ‘Do not expect to see me home over Christmas’. “Housekeeping was my biggest concern and still is. If you’ve got no one to make the beds, how can you sell a room? “We had people answering reservation calls from home [but] one day we just had to say the phones aren’t going to go online until 9am. We didn’t even have somebody to take messages. “Just when you think you’re going good, all of a sudden a staff member goes down. Then two go down.” North Queensland’s tourist market has been hit harder than most during the pandemic. The local industry’s umbrella group estimates businesses have lost $5.3bn in potential revenue while international and many domestic tourists were locked out due to border closures. Prior to 2020, the Cairns area had about 2,500 tours and other “products” to entertain travellers. Of those, more than 600 are no longer operating. Christmas period bookings in Cairns had been strong – an increase compared with the last real summer, in December 2019. But the reality has been 50% worse than the initial forecast and “millions of dollars of cancellations”, says the Tourism Tropical North Queensland chief executive, Mark Olsen. “We had high hopes,” he says. “We saw a flurry of businesses reopening when the borders reopened. For many of them this will be the hardest time. They’ve reopened at what was going to be the boom time. They’ve scaled up and they’re ready and the customers just aren’t there. They’re the ones we worry about the most. “This was supposed to be the turning point, a domestic boom that would push us through … and it’s just been a fizzer.” Olsen says staff, linen and produce shortages had become a particular concern. Many hotels were locking rooms – not offering them to tourists – because of the shortages. “What we’re seeing is a lot of our frontline staff have left the industry or left the region. A lot of staff who were coming to help during the peak season couldn’t leave home, caught up in the Covid circus,” he says. “It’s exacerbated the problem and we’re now starting to see those supply chain issues coming through. Businesses are now losing really experienced people because the cashflow is so tight.” The chief executive of Destination Gold Coast, Patricia O’Callaghan, says the area had been banking on a $280m summer. “Things are still solid, but the challenge is that there’s a lot of businesses operating at reduced capacity or closed,” O’Callaghan says. “I would say, as a whole, tourism and hospitality is facing some of the most difficult operating conditions since the pandemic took hold. “We’ve lost so many businesses and we will continue to until these conditions improve. But we do feel like we’re moving forward. We’re seeing policy changes that are trying to ease restrictions. We’re in a phase where case numbers are increasing and trying to ride it as best as possible.” Having invested so much in the restart of domestic tourism, businesses are now looking to Easter as the next realistic chance to boost their markets – and the confidence of travellers. In Cairns, forward bookings for Easter have been encouraging. But uncertainty remains in the minds of many would-be holidaymakers.

1/16/2022,"Widely mocked plans to establish a tropical haven for cryptocurrency enthusiasts have run into trouble after a contract to buy an island in Fiji for US$12m fell through. A group of crypto-evangelists, led by Max Olivier and Helena Lopez, outlined plans for the island, Nananu-i-cake, in a lavishly animated YouTube video, featuring a wide-eyed crypto bro named Christopher landing by helicopter and being given a guided tour by a talking coin called Connie.  The full YouTube clip has been taken down, but cached copies show it touted the island as “an international hub for the community to come live, work and have fun and enjoy a first-class crypto lifestyle”, boasting “a complete ecosystem that represents the blooming crypto space” that was “a paradise made by crypto enthusiasts for crypto enthusiasts”. Areas planned included Cryptoland Bay, Crypto Beach, House of Dao – a reference to decentralised autonomous organisations, a form of non-corporate structure promoted by crypto enthusiasts as an alternative to companies – and the members-only Vladimir Club, another crypto in-joke that refers to people who hold 0.01% of a given cryptocurrency. Also on offer were 60 plots of land on what the video describes as “the Blockchain Hills” (Nananu-i-cake has only one hill). These were to be sold to “Cryptolander Kings” via non-fungible tokens – unique tokens that use the same blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The project has been compared to the collapsed Fyre festival and the 18-minute video was greeted with scoffing on social media. There was also controversy after the Cryptoland Twitter account responded to a question asking what the age of consent would be on the island with a now-hidden tweet saying: “Mental maturity should be more than enough! ;)”. The actual age of consent in Fiji is 16. Hi, we apologize if that tweet has offended someone. It was a huge misunderstanding due to the fact that the comment was misinterpreted and the response is not at all a reflection of Cryptoland’s values. Here the statement we made explaining what happened. pic.twitter.com/6nHU0kTDmw Cryptoland apologised for the tweet, saying it was a misunderstanding due to the fact its Twitter account was run by several people, not all of whom “spoke English as a first language”, and they thought the question was about age requirements to visit the island. But the project appears to have hit a bigger hurdle than bad publicity. The real estate agent selling Nananu-i-cake, Rick Kermode, of New Zealand firm Bayleys, told Guardian Australia that the contract to sell it to Cryptoland’s backers fell through this week and the island was back on the market. “We’re telling people that it was under contract during the period of time that they had the contract but it has come back on the market,” he said. The 220ha (550-acre) Nananu-i-cake sits about 1km off the northern coast of Viti Levu, one of Fiji’s two main islands, about 2.5 hours drive from the international airport. According to Kermode’s listing, it offers a jetty, five beaches and a luxury villa (with a pool) that sits on one of the island’s highest points “with magnificent 360-degree views, most particularly to the west over neighbouring Nananu-i-ra and the south Pacific Ocean”. Kermode said it was a fantastic site for tourist development because it was on the eastern side of the island that gets the least rainfall and is available for sale on freehold title, which is rare in Fiji. Tourism development on Fiji had been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, he said. “It’ll probably start to happen again, hopefully when tourism starts to regenerate itself,” Kermode said. “Covid has been a big problem for everybody.” Guardian Australia could not reach Olivier or Lopez through Bradley Robinson, whom Cryptoland describes on its website as its project manager. However, during a YouTube interview with crypto-evangelist Kyle Chasse, who claims to have bought one of the island’s plots of land, Olivier said Cryptoland made the animated promotional extravaganza because “it’s the only way you can feel what Cryptoland is”. “We tried to explain to people the vision but you realise that words just get so limited,” he said in the video, which was uploaded on 15 November. Speaking about the process of buying the island and transferring plots to “King Cryptolanders”, he said: “In the coming weeks it will require to do some paperwork, of course, transferring ownership.” Robinson said the company where he is chief executive, Raffe Hotels and Resorts, had “expressed interest in being involved in the Cryptoland project”. “To date, I have been involved in an advisory capacity during the master planning process, assisting the founders and architects with concept development,” he said. “At this stage I have not formalised any arrangements with the developer to play an ongoing role, however I am continuing to discuss various project management scenarios with them.”",News/Technology,Cryptoland runs aground as $12m bid to buy Fiji island for resort falls through ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/16/cryptoland-runs-aground-as-12m-bid-to-buy-fiji-island-for-resort-falls-through
1/16/2022,"The oil came without warning. One morning in September 2009 it was there, coating Daniel Sanda’s modest seaweed farm on the Indonesian island of Rote: a dark sheen across the water, waxy yellow-grey blocks floating in the sea.  Within days, the crop his family depended on for its livelihood turned white and died. It has still not fully recovered. The oil came swiftly, but Sanda’s fight for justice has been grindingly slow. And he is far from alone. More than a decade after the catastrophic oil spill, thousands of farmers who say they are victims of one of Australia’s worst environmental disasters are still seeking acknowledgment and compensation. In 2010 an Australian government inquiry found that the Montara oil spill was no misfortune, but the result of corporate neglect: “an accident waiting to happen”. The commission found that the Australian subsidiary of the Thai oil company PTTEP was negligent in its operation of the Montara oilwell, 250km off the coast of Western Australia, which exploded in August 2009. The federal court would later find that it had spewed more than 2,500 barrels of oil into the Timor Sea every day for 74 days. The resulting slick killed seaweed crops, destroyed fishing grounds and polluted waters over more than 90,000 sq km, an area larger than Tasmania. In March 2021, the federal court ordered the Australian subsidiary PTTEP Australasia (PTTEPAA) to pay Sanda a little over A$34,000 in damages. So far he has not received anything. In December, the company lodged an appeal, arguing there was insufficient evidence of Montara oil in the coastal areas of Rote and Kupang. The company and Sanda’s representatives have been ordered to undertake mediation. Since 2016, Sanda has been the lead plaintiff of a class action, the representative of 15,483 seaweed farmers seeking compensation for lost livelihoods and opportunities. But there are thousands more outside this group who say they have been affected by the spill – fishers, farmers and families – and who have received no apology or compensation. Ferdi Tanoni, the chairman of West Timor Care Foundation, says people are still suffering, from islands as far afield as Sabu, East Flores, Lembata and Sumba. The federal court’s decision in Sanda’s case was limited to the regions of Rote and Kupang, and PTTEP denies oil from the spill reached Indonesia. Tanoni has spent years crisscrossing the islands in the east of the Indonesian archipelago, advocating on behalf of those who claim they were affected. “It is over 100,000 people who have been affected. In some places, the crops they get are now maybe 10%, 15% of [what they were getting] before [the disaster]. There are many, many schoolchildren who don’t go to school any more because there isn’t any money. “It’s not like it used to be. It’s a very, very hard life now.” In December, Tanoni travelled to Jakarta for a meeting of the Montara taskforce, the beginning, he hoped, of potential negotiations over a settlement. At the last minute, the meeting was postponed; progress stalled again. In January 2009, PTTEPAA chose to plug one of four wells in its newly drilled Montara oilfield in the Timor Sea, 700km from Darwin and 240km from the Indonesian island of Rote. The 2010 inquiry found the job was done carelessly and incompetently: the company did not come “within a ‘bull’s roar’ of sensible oilfield practice”. Three control barriers used to cap the well had not been tested, all were deficient and one had not been properly installed. “The blowout was not a reflection of one unfortunate incident, or of bad luck. What happened with the H1 Well was an accident waiting to happen; the company’s systems and processes were so deficient and its key personnel so lacking in basic competence, that the blowout can properly be said to have been an event waiting to occur,” the inquiry found. The blowout sent uncontrolled plumes of oil rushing into the sea. The company claimed the leak was equivalent to 400 barrels of oil a day – the actual figure, the federal court found in its decision in Sanda’s case, was more than 2,500 barrels each day. By the time the blowout was arrested, after 74 days, oil had spread over more than 90,000 sq km. Eighty-one villages on Rote Island and around the city of Kupang on Timor were hit by the slick. It was a month after the Montara blowout when the oil arrived in the waters off Rote, late in September 2009 – yellow-grey blocks about the size of golf balls floating in a once-clear sea that was now glossy and dark. The sea smelled pungently of oil and was filled with dead fish. In three days, Sanda’s seaweed crop turned white and died. Seaweed farming was a critical industry for thousands in the region. Since 2000, Indonesia had emerged as the world’s dominant source of raw, dried seaweed, and the eastern islands of the archipelago were a key source. The industry had proved an economic boon to villages along thousands of kilometres of coastline. Families who had previously eked out a subsistence existence through farming and fishing found economic stability through a growing global demand for their product. Indonesian seaweed was used in food, fertilisers, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. More than half the households in the region relied exclusively on seaweed farming for income. Seaweed built houses, met hospital bills, put children through school. The farmers who gave evidence in Sanda’s case said the oil that arrived after the Montara spill killed it all and that, although now growing again, the seaweed has never fully recovered. Sanda told the court he had been introduced to seaweed farming by the local bupati – government official – who encouraged him to mark out a plot at Inggurae Beach on Rote Island, growing seaweed from seed on long ropes in the water. The income he earned paid for Sanda to add brick walls and a kitchen to his home, to buy furniture and a motorbike, and to send his children to university. He donated money to his church. All over his village, families rode the wave of economic development. “Before the oil came, my seaweed crops were rich and healthy, and the income from seaweed harvesting was good,” Sanda says. “In 2009, after the oil came, my seaweed became white and weak, then fell down and was washed away by the current.” Justice David Yates of the federal court said Sanda had suffered “a very significant loss” that devastated his income and destroyed his family’s way of life for years. The company accepted it had been negligent in its operation of the well, but argued the oil lost did not reach Indonesian waters and, if it did, its concentration was not toxic enough to destroy the seaweed crops. The company also denied it owed a duty of care to the farmers. Its lawyers argued the farmers’ evidence was unreliable, saying their memories had been contaminated by “consensus” versions of the facts they had discussed with one another. This was rejected by Yates, who said the seaweed farmers had given “accurate and honest accounts”. “I am left in no doubt that all witnesses observed a single, strikingly unusual and unique event in that region at that time,” the judge said. In 2012, PTTEPAA was fined $510,000 in the Darwin local court for breaches of the Offshore Petroleum Act. The company has previously said it has spent more than $40m on the clean-up. The company conducted a 2013 environmental monitoring survey that found “no oil reached the Indonesian coast”, and that 98.6% of the spilled oil remained within Australian territorial waters. The company was not given permission to survey any Indonesian islands. PTTEPAA sold Montara in 2018. A spokesperson for PTTEPAA says the company “remains disappointed” by the federal court’s decision. The spokesperson says the court’s judgment related only to Sanda’s claim and that the other 15,482 claimants were “statute-barred and must be determined separately”. “The court’s decision does not negate the requirement for individuals to demonstrate their actual loss and damage,” the company says. At a court hearing on 21 December lawyers for the farmers said that to individually determine more than 15,000 claims could take “60 years of full-time judicial attention”. The company’s appeal documents argue, among other things, that the original decision wrongly dismissed or placed insufficient weight on evidence from some experts that said it was likely oil from the Montara spill never reached Sanda’s island. The company argues the decision in Sanda’s favour was flawed, and that the judge “should have instead found that Sanda failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that Montara oil reached the coastal areas of Rote and Kupang in a sufficient quantity or concentration to cause damage to seaweed crops”. Lawyers for the company argued before the court that seaweed crops may have been affected by ‘ice-ice’ disease, caused by rising sea temperatures and climate change. The judge said he was “not persuaded” there was evidence to support this. Ben Slade, a managing principal at the law firm Maurice Blackburn, has run the class action since 2016. Slade says the right to exploit natural resources carries with it serious responsibilities, including a duty of care to those affected by careless management of those resources. “PTTEPAA was supremely careless. Its management of the Montara well didn’t come within a bull’s roar of competence and the consequence of that failure was that almost fifteen and a half thousand seaweed farmers suffered devastating economic loss. The Australian courts have found they should be compensated for that,” he says. “The company has denied responsibility in the Australian courts aggressively and has resisted every step of the way. It has taken years and years of working tirelessly to get this case towards a conclusion, when we’ve been right all along.” Emily Mitchell, the research director at Jubilee Australia Research Centre, says tens of thousands more people may have been affected. “No study has ever been funded by PTTEP Australasia in Indonesia into the impacts of the Montara oil disaster,” she says. “In East Nusa Tenggara, 12 years after the spill, people still do not have answers about the extent of the damage, let alone how that damage can be fixed. How will the mangroves grow back? How will fish stocks improve? That is completely unacceptable.” Mitchell says the transnational nature of the oil spill has complicated the effort to hold the company to account. She says environmental impacts in Prince William Sound, Alaska, were still being felt a quarter of a century after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill. “We are now at the halfway point of that timeline, yet there has still never been any comprehensive assessment funded by the company to assess the damage in Indonesia,” she says. Ferdi Tanoni keeps travelling, keeps talking. He says the company must accept its fault, and that the governments of Australia and Indonesia must “have the courage” to ensure justice is done. “People keep calling me and I say to them, ‘keep on praying and we will win’. We cannot do anything else. We have to keep going.”",News/Environment,"‘Very hard life now’: 12 years after the Montara oil spill, Indonesians are still fighting to be heard",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/16/very-hard-life-now-12-years-after-the-montara-oil-spill-indonesians-are-still-fighting-to-be-heard
1/16/2022,"The Chinese Communist party appears utterly deluded. Hasn’t it learned in its 100-year history that some politicians aren’t worth buying? Wasting its money, or rather the money of the subjugated Chinese people, on Barry Gardiner, of all MPs, seems more silly than sinister. Why bother? If you’ve never heard of him, Gardiner is an unremarkable Corbynista, who has continued the far left’s tradition of excusing anti-western dictatorships. The Labour MP took £420,000, a large whack even by the lax standards of Westminster, from Christine Ching Kui Lee, an influence-peddler MI5 said had “established links” for Beijing with British politicians.  Suddenly, Gardiner had to find excuses for himself rather than a regime that is terrorising the Uyghur people, occupying Tibet and crushing democracy in Hong Kong. He said he didn’t know Lee had links to a hostile foreign power – presumably, he thought she was rewarding his stand on renationalising the railways. And in any case he had been “critical of the Chinese government on many occasions”. This was news to the journalists who recorded the revolting moment when Gardiner was in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and deplored on the BBC, “the escalation of violence between protesters in Hong Kong and ordinary people in Hong Kong”, as if the threat to “ordinary people” is not a dictatorial superpower that stamps their rights into the dust. But when Gardiner said he was a “very poor investment” from a Chinese point of view, he was right, and he brought back my original question: why bother? The answer is that, as Xi Jinping turns China from a one-party state into a one-man imperium, everything matters. No detail is too small to sweat. No sympathetic politician too obscure to ignore. With opponents, Xi demands a gangster’s respect by unleashing retaliation out of all proportion to the original offence. China explodes at trivial examples of opposition a stable superpower would have the self-confidence to ignore. If you want to know why Muslim countries stay silent about the persecution of fellow Muslims in Xinjiang or why scientists were so quick to dismiss the theory that the Covid pandemic began with a leak from a Wuhan lab, look at China’s willingness to use overweening force to secure conformity with the party line. Filippa Lentzos, of the Centre for Science and Security Studies at King’s College, London, was describing Covid scientists when she said they did not talk about lab leaks “because they feared for their careers [and] their grants”. But she might have been describing businesses and governments, too. Last year, I heard the Czech politician Zdeněk Hřib explain to the leaders of European cities how he had learned the hard way why they should not allow Chinese technology in their infrastructure or have any dealings with the organs of the Chinese state. He discovered when he became mayor of Prague in 2018 that the city had committed itself to supporting Xi’s one-China policy, as part of an apparently harmless twinning agreement with Beijing. Hřib abandoned the policy because he was a liberal who did not agree with forcing Taiwanese people into a communist state against their wishes. In any event, he thought it ridiculous for a central European city to take a position on conflicts in the far east. China reacted as if he had declared war. It banned cultural contacts. Czech oligarchs with Chinese interests hired hack journalists and PR shills to attack him. Miloš Zeman, who was then the Czech republic’s Trumpian president, warned him and Prague of “unpleasant consequences”. Today it is Lithuania’s turn. China is blocking imports and threatening multinationals with punishments if they do business with the tiny Baltic country, solely because it trades with Taiwan. We should bother, not out of admiration for this government’s apparent policy of committing British forces to fight alongside the US in a war over Taiwan, but because of what China is doing to Britain. The Chinese embassy showed why when it responded to the spying claims by accusing the security service of “smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK”. Muslims, Jews, Chinese people and others undoubtedly worry about blowback when global politics turns national attention towards minorities. But in this instance there is no greater intimidatory threat to Chinese people in the UK than the Chinese Communist party. Or, for that matter, to Chinese people in China. Within hours of the Gardiner story breaking, a contact who works for the pro-democracy movement told me that, even after they have found asylum in the UK, Hong Kong activists communicate through encrypted apps because they worry about what could happen to them here and to their families in China. Just before Christmas, two activists who dared to speak publicly described their “never-ending fear” to the New Statesman. You could see why they were frightened. Anonymous spies had offered £10,000 on the Chinese social media platform WeChat for their work or home addresses. Meanwhile, universities, so quick to atone for the slavery of the past, show little concern for modern-day slavery in Xinjiang as they hoover up Chinese money. They say they want safe spaces to protect students from the tiniest of micro-aggressions, and yet allow the Chinese state, via its on-campus Confucius Institutes, to keep tabs on Chinese students and their teachers. The government should close them, as the Swedish government has, and act to build the UK’s resilience against dictatorial enemies. But there’s the rub. It’s not just that the collapsing Johnson administration is incapable of taking serious measures. Even when the Tories were in their pomp, they showed no inclination to damn the sources of corruption. Honourable MPs and whistleblowers have warned for years that the openness of the City, the libel law, estate agency and indeed the Conservative party to dubious Russian money undermined national security. Last summer, I wrote that all the professional services a dictatorship could want was on open sale in the capital, and warned that if Putin’s allies did not worry ministers, they “should reflect on what will happen when the Chinese Communist party realises what London has to offer”. No worthwhile reforms followed, for a reason I should have grasped at the time. Worthwhile reform is impossible for as long as the Conservatives remain in power.

There are more tangible psychological ramifications to be found: a 2019 study by the United Nations revealed that the female voices of digital assistants – like Siri and Alexa – were entrenching gender stereotypes. “The speech of most voice assistants … sends a signal that women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers,” the study found. By altering your Siri’s voice setting, you are training your brain to unlearn the coded biases within its subconscious – or at least that’s what you can tell yourself.

1/16/2022,"For most Australians, mention of the Yarra River likely brings to mind the opaque sludge that wends its way through Melbourne’s central business district. But the river didn’t always look like that, and if you follow it upstream towards its source in the Dandenong Ranges, the vista is one of verdant bush, clean air and bubbling cold rapids. This is the part of the Yarra on which we are going tubing – that is, rolling down the river on little more than a tyre tube.  We’re on the outskirts of the lush green bush town of Warburton, and our hosts are Richard and Simone, who run the Warburton Motel. They bought it pre-pandemic and renovated the tired old country motor inn to a spruced up, activity-oriented getaway with a community vibe, and gorgeously restored 1966 bathrooms. The adventure arm of their business, Bike and Hike, is literally run out of their garage. The key conceit is that it’s more enjoyable to take a long walk, ride a long way – or, in our case, float down the river in one direction – than it is to hike there and back again, or repeat the same section of river over and over, lugging your tubes back up the dusty bank when you want another go. Of course, you could go tubing on your own. While driving us upriver in his van, Richard points out intrepid children doing precisely that: pushing off from the bank behind a row of tents in the riverside camping ground and tumbling down the rapids. Getting set up to go tubing yourself could be as simple as getting your hands on an old truck tyre, but if you were going to fork out for some specialised kit, you’d be looking at about $120 for the heavy duty tube, at least $60 for a paddle, and between $40 and $100 for a life jacket, if you want to wear one. The advantage of doing it with a company like Bike and Hike, though, is not simply that they have all the equipment so the cost is lower for a one-off ($47.50 per head), they’ll also do the leg work of driving you a solid way upstream, so you can just focus on the fun bit: paddling downriver. Pushing off from our launch point (a nondescript clearing near the river road) I quickly realise that steering is going to be a challenge. The current catches me and immediately pulls me downstream, but reclining in a bouncy rubber raft is not the best posture for paddling – a lesson I learn after accidentally splashing cold water in my own lap and crashing straight through some overhanging, cobweb-covered branches. Whoops. It takes me about half the ride to get the knack of it, paddling on one side of the tube and making strategic use of spinning in circles in order to manoeuvre around obstacles. Once I can direct myself away from the snags and overhanging branches without completely spinning out, I’m able to start appreciating the beauty of the river itself. And it is lovely. The trees are huge and majestic. My companion points out a sacred kingfisher, diving in the rushing water for prey. A little further on, a pair of rufous fantails start swooping around us, snapping up insects. And then I have to start frantically paddling again, lest I crash into a fallen tree. (My advice: wear shoes.) We’re on the water for about an hour and 20 minutes, though the time flies. We’re happy, drenched and buzzing with adrenaline when we climb out – twice, in my case, once unsuccessfully. With Warburton only 90 minutes from home, we could have driven up and back in a day, but we decided to spend the night instead. The town has a range of pub-style accommodation at the also recently renovated Alpine Retreat Hotel (from $176 p/n). It’s not a huge town, but for those who aren’t particularly water-oriented, there is a beautiful bike trail that starts off the main drag and runs all the way to Lilydale following the old train line, and a gentle riverside walk for the less energetic. For the drive back the next morning, Silva Coffee Roasters does a coffee tasting (like wine tasting, but instead of putting you to sleep it makes you really wired). The town is also full of quirky vintage and trash-and-treasure stores that haven’t yet been totally picked over. I browse through, eyes peeled for old truck tyres.

1/16/2022,"Virat Kohli has left the building. India’s most vocal captain, on and off the field, signed off from his Test leadership position via social media. A day earlier Kohli had addressed the media after India’s loss to South Africa in the Cape Town Test that gave the home team the series 2-1, but did not hint at stepping down. There was no intimation from the Board of Control for Cricket in India, not so much as a tweet or a media release. When he thought the time was right, Kohli called it. In his time as Test captain Kohli led India in 68 Tests, winning 40 and losing only 17. Statistically, he is India’s most successful captain. Globally, too, he stands tall. Only South Africa’s Graeme Smith (53 wins), Australians Ricky Ponting (48) and Steve Waugh (41) have a better record as skipper.  Kohli has built a legacy that will probably live on long after him. This is of an Indian team that can and will win overseas, in any and all conditions. When he took over as captain, Kohli’s vision was of a side that could win in Australia and England. He achieved both by building a fast-bowling infrastructure that was previously absent in Indian cricket. Kohli did not settle for one or two fast bowlers. He demanded he had a half-dozen at his disposal to choose from at any point, with any and all being able to win him matches. This school of thought needed the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru to work with the India A set up, advised by the Indian team’s coaching staff, to work together. That this happened was a miracle of sorts, but it was a non-negotiable to Kohli. Once he had the resources, he deployed them. Even when it was not the most prudent move, at times when it might have cost India, Kohli played five specialist bowlers. This allowed the bowlers in that group to grow individually and as a pack that hunted together. But it also meant that India’s batsmen were perpetually put on notice. The top order had to score or there would be hell to pay for. What effect this had on Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, whose careers seem in terminal decline, only time will tell. For now, Kohli the batsman comes to the fore. Even children on the street in India know that it has been two years and 15 Tests since Kohli last scored a Test hundred. Kohli made 136 against Bangladesh in a pink-ball Test in Kolkata, but since then he has not been able to keep up the high standards he has set. To add to the intrigue, Kohli announced in September last year that he would give up the captaincy of the Twenty20 International team, also via social media, to allow himself some much-needed mental space. When he did so, Kohli said that he looked forward to leading the Indian team in the 2023 50-over World Cup at home. In December last year India’s selectors chose to unify the white-ball captaincy, which meant relieving Kohli of the 50-over leadership and handing it to Rohit Sharma. If he did not see the writing on the wall then, the most powerful man in Indian cricket, and by extension world cricket, seemed to have finally got the memo after India’s 2-1 loss to South Africa. “It’s been seven years of hard work, toil and relentless perseverance every day to take the team in the right direction,” Kohli posted in his retirement statement. “I’ve done the job with absolute honesty and left nothing out there. Everything has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test captain of India, it’s now.” “There have been many ups and also some downs along the journey, but never has there been a lack of effort or lack of belief,” he added. “I have always believed in giving my 120% in everything I do, and if I can’t do that, I know it’s not the right thing to do. I have absolutely clarity in my heart and I cannot be dishonest to my team.” At 34, Sharma is not the obvious choice as the inheritor of Kohli’s legacy, but this is just as well as he is his own man. A batsman of excellence in his own right, Sharma now has the mantle he was probably best suited to years ago. He is an exceptional leader of men, as five Indian Premier League titles demonstrate, but even when he has been called upon to step in for India he has been creative and efficient. What this means for Kohli is less clear. In all his career he has been the alpha, the top dog, the one running the team. It will be a challenge for him to adjust to life as a mere player, one batsman among many, even if special. Once again in his cricketing life, Kohli will have to take instruction from someone else.
