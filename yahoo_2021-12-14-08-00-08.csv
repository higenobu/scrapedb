12/14/2021,"MAYFIELD, Ky. — As a catastrophic tornado approached this city Friday, employees of a candle factory — which would later be destroyed — heard the warning sirens and wanted to leave the building. But at least four workers said supervisors warned employees that they would be fired if they left their shifts early. For hours, as word of the coming storm spread, as many as 15 workers beseeched managers to let them take shelter at their own homes, only to have their requests rebuffed, the workers said. Fearing for their safety, some left during their shifts regardless of the repercussions. At least eight people died in the Mayfield Consumer Products factory, which makes scented candles. The facility was leveled, and all that is left is rubble. Photos and videos of its widespread mangled remains have become symbols of the enormous destructive power of Friday’s tornado system. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that 74 people were confirmed dead in the state.  McKayla Emery, 21, said in an interview from her hospital bed that workers first asked to leave shortly after tornado sirens sounded outside the factory around 5:30 p.m. Employees congregated in bathrooms and inside hallways, but the real tornado wouldn’t arrive for several more hours. After employees decided that the immediate danger had passed, several began asking to go home, the workers said. “People had questioned if they could leave or go home,” said Emery, who preferred to stay at work and make extra money. Overtime pay was available, but it wasn’t clear whether those who stayed were offered additional pay. Supervisors and team leaders told employees that leaving would probably jeopardize their jobs, the employees said. “If you leave, you’re more than likely to be fired,” Emery said she overheard managers tell four workers standing near her who wanted to leave. “I heard that with my own ears.” About 15 people asked to go home during the night shift shortly after the first emergency alarm sounded outside the facility, said another employee, Haley Conder, 29. There was a three- to four-hour window between the first and second emergency alarms when workers should have been allowed to go home, she said. Initially, Conder said, team leaders told her they wouldn’t let workers leave because of safety precautions, so they kept everyone in the hallways and the bathrooms. Once they mistakenly thought the tornado was no longer a danger, they sent everyone back to work, employees said. Anyone who wanted to leave should have been allowed to, Conder said. Company officials denied the allegations. “It’s absolutely untrue,” said Bob Ferguson, a spokesman for Mayfield Consumer Products. “We’ve had a policy in place since Covid began. Employees can leave any time they want to leave and they can come back the next day.” He also denied that managers told employees that leaving their shifts meant risking their jobs. Ferguson said managers and team leaders undergo a series of emergency drills that follow guidelines of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. “Those protocols are in place and were followed,” he said. A 24-hour hotline is available as of Monday for employees to call about hazard pay, grief counseling and other assistance, he said. Autumn Kirks, a team lead at the factory who was working that night, denied Monday afternoon on MSNBC that people’s jobs were threatened if they didn’t go in. But another employee, Latavia Halliburton, said she witnessed workers’ being threatened with termination if they left. “Some people asked if they could leave,” but managers told them they would be fired if they did, she said. The first tornado warning passed without any damage, but several hours later, another warning was issued. Once the second tornado siren sounded sometime after 9 p.m. Friday, Conder and a group of others approached three managers asking to go home. “‘You can’t leave. You can’t leave. You have to stay here,’” Conder said the managers told her. “The situation was bad. Everyone was uncomfortable.” Mark Saxton, 37, a forklift operator, said that he would have preferred to leave but that he wasn’t given the option. “That’s the thing. We should have been able to leave,” Saxton said. “The first warning came, and they just had us go in the hallway. After the warning, they had us go back to work. They never offered us to go home.” As the storm moved forward after the second siren, the employees took shelter. The lights in the building started to flicker. Moments later, Emery, who was standing near the candle wax and fragrance room, was struck in the head by a piece of concrete. “I kid you not, I heard a loud noise and the next thing I know, I was stuck under a cement wall,” she said. “I couldn’t move anything. I couldn’t push anything. I was stuck.” Emery, who was trapped for six hours, had several chemical burn marks on her legs, her buttocks and her forehead from the candle wax. She also sustained kidney damage, her urine is black, and she still can’t move her legs because of the swelling and from having been motionless for so long. Employees who wanted to go home early said they were mistreated. “It hurts, ’cause I feel like we were neglected,” Saxton said.",U.S./NBC News,"Factory bosses to workers before tornado: 'If you leave, you're more than likely to be fired'",https://news.yahoo.com/factory-bosses-workers-tornado-leave-214937404.html
12/14/2021,"The Fox News Christmas tree fire came up during Monday's White House press briefing. Peter Doocy linked it to New York's bail reform law and nationwide crime. He also mentioned the ""half-million dollar"" damages caused by the fire. Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked about the network's highly publicized Christmas tree fire during Monday's White House press briefing. Doocy inquired if the Biden administration considers it ""good governing"" for the man accused of setting fire to the network's ""all-American Christmas tree on Fox Square"" along Sixth Avenue in Manhattan to be released without bail. The network's morning show ""Fox & Friends"" covered the fire last week as a commentary on how ""no city is safe, no person is safe, from the subway on down."" The next day, a new tree was set up outside Fox News headquarters. Since the suspect was charged with several misdemeanors — including arson, criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and criminal trespass — but not a violent felony, he was able to be released without bail under New York's bail reform law. Only third degree felony arson requires a defendant to post bond under New York's 2019 law. The exchange between Doocy and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was part of a broader question about crime. Doocy described a nationwide ""increase in criminal activity because some prosecutors are too soft on crime,"" a complicated subject involving a record spike in murders from 2020 but far fewer nationwide than the peak reached in the early 1990s, as well as a continuation of the overall crime rate lowering nationwide since 1994. Stringing together other incidents he tied to New York's bail reform law — which the Biden administration has no control over — Doocy brought his employer's Christmas tree fire into the mix. ""So the final one would be, just in the last week we saw a New York Post item about a pickpocket with more than 30 arrests, back out on the street,"" Doocy said. ""We've seen an arsonist burn down a half-million dollar Christmas tree in New York City, back out on the streets,"" he continued. ""Does the president think that's good governing?"" Psaki showed little patience for Doocy's third question, referring him to the New York Police Department, which announced the arrest of the suspect shortly after the early morning blaze last week. ""Again, I think I've spoken to the president's concern about retail theft,"" Psaki replied. ""If you have specific — and any actions we've taken, for specific cases, I would point you to the local police departments or the Department of Justice."" Psaki has dismissed questions from Fox News in the past. Last month, she brushed off Doocy's question on whether President Joe Biden should apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who was recently acquitted of all charges and found not guilty of fatally shooting two men during civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin last year. Rittenhouse accused Biden of ""defaming"" him by including an image of him alongsisde white supremacists and militia groups in a 2020 campaign video. ""The president believes in condemning hatred, division and violence. That's exactly what was done in that video,"" Psaki said at the time. Despite the occasional tense exchange in the briefing room, Doocy told the New York Times in September that it ""never feels like I'm getting smacked down or vice versa."" ""I understand why it looks like that, some of the ways that stuff gets clipped, but it doesn't feel like that in the room,"" he said.

12/14/2021,"Scientists have detected new cracks in the key ice shelf that buttresses Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier, indicating that the ice shelf could break apart within the next five years. Why it matters: The destruction of the ice shelf could accelerate the movement of inland ice into the sea, eventually causing sea levels to rise by several feet and endangering coastal communities worldwide, per the Washington Post. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free State of play: The Thwaites Glacier is known as the ""doomsday glacier,"" due to the possibility that it may already be past a tipping point into a virtually unstoppable, runaway melt. Roughly the size of Florida, the Thwaites Glacier's meltwater already contributes to about 4% of global sea level rise. The Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf acts as a brace preventing faster flow of meltwater from the glacier, and the shelf is held in place by an underwater mountain, according to the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This part of the ice shelf was previously thought to be stable until scientists took new measurements during a field campaign over the past 2 years. Warming ocean water is melting the ice from below, meaning the shelf is gradually losing its grip on the underwater mountain and satellite imagery has revealed fractures in the shelf. ""Similar to a growing crack in the windshield of a car, a slowly growing crack means the windshield is weak and a small bump to the car might cause the windshield to suddenly break apart into hundreds of panes of glass,"" reads a summary of the findings. The breaking of the ice shelf will increase the flow of ice off Antarctica, it adds. The big picture: The Thwaites glacier is situated in a deep basin, so if it collapses, neighboring glaciers would follow, and over the next few centuries it could lead to the loss of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet, contributing to a large rise in sea levels, according to Science. “That would be a global change,” Robert DeConto, a glaciologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, told Science. “Our coastlines will look different from space.” Like this article?
