2/24/2022,"The best free streaming service for cinephiles is the Korean Film Archive’s YouTube channel. It hosts an ever-expanding collection of restored and subtitled films that have been chosen for their outstanding quality and their significance to the history of Korean cinema. Imagine a free US film archive that made available Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and The Godfather, as well as a hundred other classics, and you start to see what a gift KOFA’s YouTube channel is to the world.  Among the many great films it offers, one stands out above them all: Obaltan, Yu Hyun-mok’s 1961 masterpiece about life in Seoul in the aftermath of the Korean war. The best way to understand the difference between how Obaltan is regarded in South Korea and how it is regarded in the west is to consider the results of three polls. In a poll of film-makers held in 1999 by the South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo, Obaltan was voted the best Korean movie ever made. In a 2014 poll of experts organised by the Korean Film Archive itself, the title of greatest Korean film was shared by three movies. They were Ha Gil-jong’s bittersweet campus comedy The March of Fools; Kim Ki-young’s satirical horror movie The Housemaid (which is a favourite of Martin Scorsese’s and the acknowledged inspiration for Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning Parasite); and, once again, Obaltan. In contrast, when the British Film Institute’s Sight and Sound magazine held the 2012 edition of its prestigious Greatest Films of All Time poll, Obaltan did not receive a single vote from any of the 846 participants. Other Korean classics got votes. Ed Wood’s Plan 9 From Outer Space got a vote. But Obaltan got none. Clearly, this is a film that most audiences in the Anglosphere have yet to discover. And what a film they will find when they do. Obaltan – often translated as “Stray Bullet” or, perhaps more accurately, as “Aimless Bullet” – is as desolate and atmospheric as any American film noir. It sits alongside The Third Man and some of the major classics of Italian neorealism as one of the great films about peacetime in a city still disfigured by war. The brilliance of Obaltan’s narrative is that the film focuses on whichever character is most important to the action for as long as they remain important to the action, and then withdraws from them almost completely. Consequently, it takes a while to work out which is the central character. At first, it seems as if it could be Gyeongsik (Yoon Il-bong), a disabled veteran who now walks with crutches and feels he has lost his place in the world as surely as if he had never returned from the war. Then it appears to be Gyeongsik’s former army comrade, Yeongho (Choi Moo-ryong), who is finding it similarly difficult to fit into civilian society. Eventually, we see that the character around whom all the others are in orbit is in fact Yeongho’s brother, Cheolho (Kim Jin-kyu), a quiet, dedicated accountant on whose small salary an entire extended family depends. The family lives in Haebangchon (“Liberation Village”), a hillside shanty town filled with families that lost their homes in the war and / or defected from North Korea. Cheolho’s wife is nine months pregnant. His brother is a liability. His sister is soon to be arrested for prostitution. And his bedridden mother, who has post-traumatic stress disorder or dementia or both, believes bombs are still dropping and repeatedly moans “Let’s go!” or “Let’s get out of here!” – by far the most famous lines in the script – to relatives who have nowhere to go and no way of getting there if they did. On top of that, he has an incessant toothache he can’t afford to fix. Kim Jin-kyu’s performance is so effective that the pain seeps out of Cheolho’s teeth and into our own. Watching events wear him down is like watching waves relentlessly eroding a precarious cliff. The most haunting image in Obaltan is one of the most haunting images I’ve ever seen. Driven to crime, Yeongho botches a bank robbery. Chased by the police, he flees through a sewer, where he hears a baby’s cry. The baby, he sees, is bound to its mother’s back. The mother has hanged herself. Yeongho runs on. So do the police officers. The baby continues crying. The shot of the dead mother’s dangling body is as fleeting, and as unforgettable, as our first glimpse of Orson Welles in The Third Man. Seeing it, we realise – if we haven’t realised already – that the wretched lives we have been following in the film are not unusual. Everyone in post-war Seoul has a story of suffering, and the city is indifferent to them all.

2/24/2022,"British officials are concerned about “spillover” from any heightened Russian cyber-activity in Ukraine, as demonstrated by last week’s attack on two banks by hackers linked to the GRU spy agency. Although there have been no Ukraine-related Russian attacks on the UK since start of the crisis, cyber-specialists have been holding meetings with key companies to discuss the possible threat and how it could be tackled.  “Organisations need to understand there is a heightened risk,” said one official, with a particular focus on monitoring whether an intense Russian cyber-attack on Ukrainian targets could have wider consequences. Jeremy Fleming, the head of the spy agency GCHQ, held a roundtable last week to discuss the threat with organisations responsible for Britain’s “critical national infrastructure”, which includes the communications, energy, food, health and transport sectors. Ukraine has been a target for regular Russian cyber-attacks since the start of the war in 2014 and last week was hit with a “sophisticated” attack that tried to disrupt customer services at two Ukrainian banks and the website of the defence ministry. On Friday, the NCSC, Britain’s cybersecurity agency, said it believed Russia’s GRU military intelligence was behind the “denial of service” attack. But although relatively serious, officials believe it was “not necessarily a precursor” for a military offensive or enhanced cyber-action. A recent NCSC briefing, which is considered still valid, said: “While the NCSC is not aware of any current specific threats to UK organisations in relation to events in and around Ukraine, there has been an historical pattern of cyber-attacks on Ukraine with international consequences.” In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by GRU operatives. Ukraine’s long experience in dealing with cyber-attacks – two of which, in 2015 and 2016, briefly disrupted some power supplies – means that western officials believe Kyiv is relatively experienced at picking up the pieces after a damaging attack. Nevertheless, the UK and the US have been helping the country’s cyber security agencies, as the crisis has intensified. On Tuesday, six EU countries said they too would offer further assistance. A western official said: “We share our understanding of the treats and we have and continue make them aware of threats.”",News/Technology,UK firms warned of Russian cyberwar ‘spillover’ from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/23/uk-firms-warned-russia-cyberwar-spillover-ukraine-critical-infrastructure
2/24/2022,"One day, nearly six years ago, I had to sit completely still for several hours at a time. I was having my portrait painted, you see, by three artists for the Sky programme Portrait Artist of the Year. As far back as primary school, I was diagnosed by several adults as having ants in my pants. I am afraid those ants are still there, poor things. What lives they have led. I find keeping still even for a few minutes a real challenge at the best of times. For two two-hour sessions, under the close scrutiny of the artists and several television cameras, it was nothing short of traumatic. I can only compare the feeling to the odd occasions when I’ve experienced claustrophobia, trapped in a lift or a jam-packed aircraft cabin on a long flight. When the ordeal came to an end, I was invited to view the likenesses these artists had created. One was the work of a woman from the West Country. I will not name her, because I can’t imagine this was the proudest hour of her artistic career and doubtless she doesn’t want to be reminded of it. In her portrait, I looked like how I might appear after a heavy night out, if viewed through some misshaped glass. I’ve never been a great admirer of my face, but this was a picture that even my fiercest critic would acknowledge didn’t flatter me. To put it another way: even when my self-esteem has hit rock bottom, I never think of myself as looking quite this bad.  The other two portraits were really good. One was a colourful affair featuring me looking thoughtfully, but amiably, into the middle distance. I’ll be honest with you: I quite fancied myself (and I don’t say that very often). Ooh, I thought: he’s caught the blue in my eyes just right. The third portrait was an altogether more severe creation, in charcoal and chalk. It was plainly a very skilful piece of work, but there was something about it I couldn’t love. It looked to me like the kind of portrait an eastern European dictator might have commissioned to convey a benevolent but not-to-be-trifled-with authority. There was a subtle but unmistakeable air of menace about me. It reminded me of the images of President Tito I used to see as a kid adorning a wall in every shop, office, bar and restaurant of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The deal with the show was that I was allowed to keep one of the three portraits. A friend who worked on the programme advised me to go for the severe one. But because I found it so much more pleasant to look at, I went for the colourful one. My friend told me I was an idiot. Although the Titoesque portrait was judged the winner of this episode of the show, I went away happy. Even when the chap who painted it, Gareth Reid, went on to win the whole competition (for his picture of Graham Norton), I still preferred the colourful one. I still preferred it even when the work of the newly crowned portrait artist of the year shot up in value and I was offered the Tito-style one for £15,000. The more people told me I had made an idiotic decision, the more I preferred the one I had chosen. And I still bloody well prefer it, even though that confounded winning portrait is now featuring at an exhibition of the show’s best art at a gallery in Warwickshire and worth even more. My beloved colourful one, however, hangs unloved in my mum’s bedroom. She is open to offers in excess of £15,000, if you’re interested.

2/24/2022,"“Crude” computer programs that prioritise new road building should be banned from the design of new housing because they cause billions to be diverted to roads that could be used for creating more compact communities, campaigners claim. Traffic modelling spreadsheets that “almost always tell us that ‘computer says road’”, should no longer be used by planners and more money should be spent on building places geared for walking, cycling and public transport, warns a report by the Create Streets campaign.  It been endorsed by Rory Stewart, the former Conservative leadership candidate, Toby Lloyd, a former Downing Street housing adviser and the Royal Town Planning Institute. The attack on “big road urbanism” argues that the Department for Transport cost-benefit modelling tools for new roads fail to “properly capture non-travel-time benefits, such as health, wellbeing and the environment… so the answer will always be to build more or bigger roads.” The Department for Transport strongly denied any bias towards road-building in its modelling, and a spokesperson said: “The environment is at the heart of our proposed transport schemes, and we always encourage sustainable options such as public transport, cycling and walking.” The Create Streets thinktank is led by Nicholas Boys Smith, a former adviser to George Osborne and and has worked with architects and urban designers close to Prince Charles to argue for more human-scale planning. It believes billions in taxpayers’ money could be saved by changing decision-making on road building with smaller sums instead spent on placing shops, gyms and other social infrastructure closer to homes linked by buses, cycle paths and walkways. The result would also be healthier and greener, it argues. As an example of what it believes is going wrong, it is highlighting plans to spend £1.4bn building one roundabout and 10 miles of new road near Bedford. The 2km-wide Black Cat interchange covers a space bigger than York city centre, which is one of the UK’s most walkable cities. But transport planners say the project will relieve heavy congestion and save drivers an hour and a half on their journeys every week. Traffic delays in England were at close to their highest level since 2015 just before the pandemic, but almost halved during the first lockdown. They have since been rising again towards peak levels. The government is pressing ahead with a £24bn road-building and renewal plan announced in 2020. Several road projects were announced last year as recipients of the £1.7bn “levelling up fund”. Road building is already the single biggest annual outlay for councils, which last year allocated £7.5bn, or 29%, of their total capital expenditure to highways and transport services. They spent ​​£6.1bn on housing. Create Streets highlights how scores of streets and squares in a popular medieval city like Siena in Tuscany can fit into the space taken by a motorway interchange in Houston, Texas. “Instead of spending tens of millions of pounds on one junction or on widening a few miles of road, we should instead design better places where more journeys are by foot, bike or public transport,” said David Milner, Create Streets’ deputy director. “We can do this by siting amenities we want to visit in the heart of new developments, not their perimeters.” Planners and developers have for decades used computer models to determine transport plans that tend to put the needs of rush hour traffic first. The impact of the pandemic, which has led to widespread remote working, and the pressing need to slash carbon emissions from domestic transport, which emits 27% of all of the UK’s CO2, are increasing calls for change. “We are seeing e-bikes being a car killer,” he added. “They increase the range and the frequency of bike riding.” The study is also being endorsed by CPRE, the countryside charity, and warns that good design principles for new and regenerated communities are being “cast aside”. “We are told the ‘infrastructure won’t cope’ or ‘the junction can’t take it’,” said Milner. “Almost every traffic model tells us that, ‘computer says road’.” Andrew Taylor, planning director of Countryside Properties, one of the UK’s largest housebuilders, is also backing the call for change. “This is not about avoiding investing in necessary junctions and improvements but about trying to refocus our energies and money on placemaking, 15-minute communities and foot and cycle connectivity within developments to reduce the need for these other physical interventions,” he said A DfT spokesperson said: “Our modelling works alongside our £5bn transport decarbonisation plan, £2bn of which is specifically invested to encourage active travel.” ",News/Politics,‘Computer says road’: call for change to ‘crude’ planning models,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/computer-says-road-call-for-change-to-crude-planning-models
2/24/2022,"This was taken in May last year in Myrnohrad, an industrial town 50 miles from Donetsk, a stronghold of the illegal Russian occupation in eastern Ukraine. Then, as now, fears of a Russian invasion were high. While much of the west thinks the threat of conflict started only a few weeks ago, it’s been the reality for Ukrainians for almost a decade. I was walking around Myrnohrad taking photos with a big portable flash and a plate camera when I saw this woman sit down and light a cigarette. She looked so confident and self-absorbed. I speak a little Russian, so I told her I was taking pictures of ordinary life across Ukraine and asked if she would pose. She agreed without hesitation.  Normally, when you ask people to pose they do just that – pose – and become self-conscious. But for this woman, it was as if I wasn’t there. It was perfect: she was completely in her thoughts. I love the blue case in her lap, though I never found out what was in it. Maybe it’s a lease for an apartment. Maybe it’s divorce papers. Whatever it is, it felt like she was on a mission. To me, she is a great symbol for Ukraine, a country that is now my home. I suspected that she had been through some tough journeys but remained resilient, brave and generous. It’s difficult to get shots this candid and the photograph was nearly used as the cover of my new book, Stop Tanks With Books. It’s a series of photographs from across the country intended to help westerners empathise with Ukrainians. Falsehoods propagated by the Kremlin have come to define how the rest of the world sees Ukraine. The idea that all Ukrainians are fascists is complete nonsense. Those myths only exist to help foment the inertia that has left the country abandoned in the face of Russian aggression for years. My own relationship with Ukraine began in 2015 when I was invited to visit by a military hospital in Kyiv. They had heard about my book Battle Against Stigma, which documented war trauma and the mental health struggles of veterans. The hospital was dealing with troops returning from the war in Donbas in the east and requested a Ukrainian-language version for its patients. I was amazed: in Britain, 500 copies of the book had been impounded on arrival in the UK at the request of the Ministry of Defence, but here was a post-Soviet country thinking so progressively about how to treat their veterans. As soon as I arrived in Ukraine I fell in love – with the people, the food, the culture and the history. I took every opportunity to come back. When the New York Times asked me to shoot people on holiday in their own country, I could’ve gone anywhere and I think the editors were surprised when I decided on Odessa. Eventually, I couldn’t shake the thought: “Why am I living in London when I could be living in Kyiv?” So a year and a half ago, I took the plunge and moved. I don’t have a second home in London. Ukraine is my home and this work is deeply personal. The British government, like others, has advised all its subjects to leave immediately, and to my mind this has fanned the flames of panic. I, like many others, am staying put. I do not want to lose my adopted home, nor see my friends and their families lose their lives defending the country’s rightful independence. Ukrainians are a proud, brave people; they won’t run away. If Russian forces invade further it will be a bloodbath. Ukrainians aren’t asking for British soldiers to come and lay down their lives. But they do want the support of western powers in repelling a Russian invasion. I hope Stop Tanks With Books adds weight to those calls. It is not a neutral work, I have picked a side. I’m pro-Russian but anti-Kremlin. Throughout my career, I have seen the role of the artist as one of counteracting state propaganda. When I embedded with the paras in Afghanistan in 2010, I found the gap between what I saw and what was reported mind-blowing. What changes people’s minds about a conflict is a poem, a song, or a photograph. It’s people’s feelings that need to be changed. To my mind, that’s the role of the artist.

2/24/2022,"The Biden administration has halted a Trump-era plan to approve a mining road in Alaska that would cut through indigenous land and alter one of the last roadless wildernesses in the US. The construction of the Ambler Road in northwest Alaska was permitted under Donald Trump over the objections from some native American groups, allowing the laying of 211 miles of road through the traditional homelands of the Koyukon, Tanana Athabascans and Iñupiat peoples.  The department of interior has now asked a federal court in Alaska to send the permit back to the department as there are “significant deficiencies we have identified” in the decision-making that led to the approval. The department said it would conduct a new environmental analysis to determine the impact of the road, which critics said will disturb pristine tundra, rivers and wildlife. The road “represents a fundamental threat to our people, our subsistence way of life and our cultural resources,” said Brian Ridley, president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, which represents 42 tribes in Alaska. “We appreciate that the federal government recognized the flaws in the previous administration’s decisions to permit the road.” Trustees for Alaska, an environment group that sued to stop the road, said that the Biden administration should’ve gone further by fully revoking the permit. “This project never should have been authorized in the first place, and the agencies can’t fix their broken analysis by papering over their mistakes after the fact,” said Suzanne Bostrom, senior staff attorney with the group. Approved in July 2020, the road is seen by proponents as an essential link to access valuable deposits in the area such as copper, cobalt, zinc, silver and gold. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican representing Alaska, said that the reversal is “stunning” and will threaten “this crucial project, which will enable Alaska to responsibly produce a range of needed minerals.” An assortment of Australian and Canadian mining companies, and Alaska’s industrial development and export authority, planned to spend $60m this year for the road and associated mines in the area, before lawsuits from native and environmental groups sought to stymie the project.",News/US news,US government halts Trump-era plan to approve mining road in Alaska,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/biden-alaska-mining-road
2/24/2022,"Aroom swarming with thousands of giant, exotic creepy-crawlies may sound like your worst nightmare (or one of Ant and Dec’s Bushtucker Trials on I’m a Celebrity). It is also the starting point for Bug Out, the latest bizarre true-crime documentary series, which is set in the US’s first bug zoo, the Philadelphia Insectarium & Butterfly Pavilion. Prepare for a mystery with more twists than a worm colony. The show focuses on the moment in August 2018 when the museum’s boss, Dr John Cambridge, arrived at work and did a double take when he realised his room, that ought to have been full of critters, was suddenly empty. Glass tanks were upended, shelves bare, displays cleared out. Thousands of live bugs, worth an estimated $50,000 (£38,000), had been stolen. It was the biggest insect heist in history.  Many of the missing animals were rare, large or potentially deadly – in some cases, all three. The thieves’ haul included scorpions, tarantulas, rhinoceros cockroaches and a six-eyed sand spider. That spider is one of the world’s most venomous arachnids, with a bite akin to that of a rattlesnake. There is no known antidote. The aspiring director Ben Feldman – not to be confused with his namesake actor, AKA Jonah from Superstore (“One of my interviewees was so disappointed,” he laughs) – was working as a lawyer in Philadelphia, his home town, when the heist news broke. Its value as a story that he could film made his ears prick up. “I’d heard of the museum,” the 37-year-old says via video call. “Lots of school trips go there. It was set up by this ex-cop called Steve Kanya. Back in 1975, he had a pest-control company called Bug Off. As a publicity stunt, he’d put his ‘Catch of the Day’ in the store window – a huge cockroach, a termite colony or whatever. He noticed that cars kept pulling over to look at it and thought: ‘Huh, there’s something here.’ That developed into the first insectarium in the country.” When Feldman heard about the theft, he contacted Cambridge. “He immediately said: ‘There’s so much more to this story.’ So I just kept pulling at strings. I figured it was just a clickbaity headline. I never expected such a crazy rollercoaster.” The case became nationwide news to such an extent that Jimmy Kimmel and Amy Poehler joked about it on late-night TV. The FBI set up a hotline for tip-offs. The museum received thousands of dollars in donations from sympathetic citizens. In the process of investigating this one-of-a-kind robbery, the Philadelphia police lifted the rock to find a seedy subculture of bug poachers, obsessive collectors and illicit smugglers. They soon surmised that, like half of workplace robberies, this was probably an inside job. But which of the museum’s eccentric staff was responsible? And where were the 7,000 bugs? Those under the magnifying glass included Kanya, who claimed Cambridge had swindled him out of ownership. The documentary also reveals that the museum’s etymology expert, Wlodek Lapkiewicz, had a lucrative sideline trading illegal species via mail. Another employee, Michael Kinzler, had a criminal record that included theft from an employer. Chris Tomasetto and Alison Mumper, a sweet couple covered in insect tattoos, were also under suspicion, having led a staff mutiny. Their colleague Kelvin Wiley was big on social media for letting bugs crawl over his face – and quit his job immediately after the heist. In one scene, Wiley casually opens his mouth and a huge, hairy tarantula crawls out. It provides one of Bug Out’s many “WTF?” moments. “There was an audible gasp from the camera crew,” says Feldman. “I showed that episode to a friend last week and as soon as the spider came out, he was like: ‘This is going to be a hit.’ He was so repulsed.” Another memorable scene shows a panicking employee disposing of a giant African snail – illegal in the US – in grisly style. “It’s the size of a dog,” says Feldman. “Like something out of Star Wars.” Cambridge, meanwhile, has a delicious turn of phrase. He describes one ex-colleague as “a tremendous ding-a-ling of a human” and another as “an enormous bag of assholes”. The surprise-laden saga takes in death threats, embezzlement and organised crime. Feldman follows the money from bug-runners in Australia to criminal cartels in Mexico. There is a botched police raid. Giant millipedes and poisonous scorpions, mailed illegally from Africa, escape inside a post van. At one point, a federal agent – the excellently named Ed Newcomer – catches the world’s most wanted butterfly smuggler, the notoriously elusive Yoshi Kojima, in a honey trap – despite Newcomer being straight and married. Bug Out took three years to make and led Feldman to quit his legal career to become a full-time film-maker. Like an off-kilter whodunit, it untangles a spider’s web of lies and exposes bitter feuds behind the scenes of a seemingly wholesome museum. Feldman tells the extraordinary story over four pacy 35-minute episodes that beggar belief and are eminently bingeable. Bug Out continues the trend away from “murdery” crime documentaries towards con-based yarns, be it online-dating scams (The Tinder Swindler, Sweet Bobby) or identity fraud (Inventing Anna, The Puppet Master). They are just as compellingly voyeuristic and equally revealing about human nature, but without the unpleasant aftertaste. “This isn’t the kind of murder-based true crime we’ve all seen a hundred times,” agrees Feldman. “I’d put Bug Out in a category of its own. It’s Tiger King meets Ace Ventura.” The story has several scorpion-like stings in its tail, and Feldman believes the full extent of the scandal still hasn’t emerged: “I think there’s more to come.” No spoilers, but the climactic episode has a dizzying rug-pull and a couple of very tense confrontations. “There was definitely an atmosphere during those conversations,” he says. “That’s where my legal training came in handy.” Bug Out is on IMDb TV, Amazon’s free streaming service, from 4 March",Arts/Television & radio,‘It’s Tiger King meets Ace Ventura’: the wild true story of the world’s biggest insect heist,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/23/bug-out-its-tiger-king-meets-ace-ventura-the-wild-true-story-of-the-worlds-biggest-insect-heist
2/24/2022,"Ministers are preparing tougher sanctions against Russia, which officials said would target UK-based oligarchs, tech exports and sovereign debt. The move follows Boris Johnson’s measures, which were criticised by Conservative MPs for failing to hit Vladimir Putin’s power base hard enough. The measures have been deemed weaker than those announced by the US and EU, though No 10 said the packages had been coordinated.  Some MPs and analysts said the UK sanctions did not match the hardline rhetoric of the prime minister, Boris Johnson. But the conciliatory efforts of some European countries such as France and Germany were followed by more sweeping sanctions, including a pause made by the German chancellor to the €10bn Nord Stream 2 pipeline. EU foreign ministers agreed sanctions to target banks financing the military operations. These are understood to include Promsvyazbank, a defence sector funder, which has also been sanctioned by the UK. Three “high net worth” individuals were sanctioned by the UK, though all three had been on US sanctions lists since 2018. The EU is to impose travel bans and asset seizures on 27 individuals and entities who played a role in “undermining Ukrainian sovereignty”, including the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the commanders of the Russian air force and Black Sea fleet. That will also apply to the 351 members of the Duma who voted in favour of Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk – a step the UK is also expected to take. Joe Biden, the US president, also imposed severe sanctions on Promsvyazbank and against Russia’s sovereign debt, which he said meant the Russian government being cut off from western financing. As yet there have been no sanctions over big state-owned commercial banks. Individuals and their relatives have also been targeted by US sanctions; those people include Aleksandr Bortnikov, the director of the Federal Security Service, and Sergei Kiriyenko, a former prime minister of Russia. Officials were reluctant to spell out what would trigger the next round of sanctions. Johnson warned Russia it would face sanctions the moment the “first Russian toecap” stepped further into Ukrainian territory. The key question is how far Russian troops will advance into territory not already under de-facto control of Russian-backed separatists. So far the advances appear to only formalise Russian presence; in practice that has been the case for eight years. Putin said that Russia recognised the borders of Luhansk and Donetsk claimed by the self-proclaimed “people’s republics”. It could mean an advance well beyond the current frontline of conflict, in areas still under the control of the Ukrainian governments and including significant towns and cities, such as Mariupol. Planned measures would have an impact on the banking and finance sectors, ban hi-tech exports, and sanction a wider range of people and companies in the defence and energy sectors and other areas of strategic significance to Russia. Stopping Russia selling sovereign debt in UK Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said Britain would stop Russia selling sovereign debt in London, which is issued as bonds in foreign currencies to finance growth and development. To limit sovereign debt sales in London, Britain would need additional legislation, according to officials. Banning Russia from the Swift payments system Banks, mostly in France, Italy and Austria, are concerned about Russia, lent an estimated $30bn, being banned from the global payment system Swift; that would hit Russian banks hard but also make it tough for European creditors to get their money back. Russia has been building up an alternative payment system. Blocking hi-tech exports One proposal is to stop shipments to Russia of computers, chips, consumer electronics, telecoms equipment and other items made anywhere in the world but produced using US, UK or EU technology. A similar measure was deployed against the Chinese technology firm Huawei. Targeting more oligarchs Officials say there is a longer list of Russian oligarchs and other allies of Putin who will be sanctioned, including people in the UK. Those targeted in the first tranche of sanctions were the billionaire Gennady Timchenko, and Boris and Igor Rotenberg, though all were already under American sanctions. Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, has said the UK could exclude Russia from the Swift payments system. It would cut Russia off from a global network used by almost all financial institutions worldwide. The US and Germany are said to be worried about the potential economic shock it could cause. Labour has also called for the UK to ban the Russian TV channel RT, by getting Ofcom to review its licence. Johnson confirmed on Wedneday that the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, had written to the broadcasting watchdog, Ofcom, asking for a review. He previously said politicians should not determine which media organisations to ban. There are also concerns about retaliations that could be taken against UK media organisations in Russia, including the BBC. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said the UK government should heed the call of Russian’s key opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, and sanction the 35 individuals he had named, using parliamentary privilege to list them in the Commons. The Conservative party is also coming under pressure to break links with Russian oligarchs who have donated more than £2m to the party. Truss said the government was taking an “escalatory approach” with international allies. She said she thought Putin was “hell-bent” on a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. “We will agree a further package in the event, which we think is highly likely, of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We don’t want to be in the situation … where we’ve got nothing left in the locker. Nothing is off the table in terms of who we’re targeting.”",News/World news,Sanctions on Russia: what is on the table?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/sanctions-on-russia-what-is-on-the-table
2/24/2022,"Under a butter-yellow sky, high up on the Altus Plain, driving my horse at full gallop, I spied a group of peasant women dancing. They hopped between feet, as if on scorching ground, twirling in unison beneath the sails of a neglected windmill. It is a mesmerising scene – one of hundreds you will happen upon while exploring the relentlessly beautiful, relentlessly hostile expanse of Elden Ring’s fantasy world, the Lands Between – but its rustic appeal is not to be trusted. I learned that lesson several hours earlier, when I caught the strains of a melancholic song carried by the wind. I rode toward the sound, hoping to meet someone who might offer support in my journey. The singer, however, was no friendly merchant or cooperative knight, but a grotesque siren, with beating leather wings and foot-long claws. The song was a ploy, and I was the prey. The dangers posed by director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s games have been notorious since 2009’s Demon’s Souls: these are challenging works, filled with eldritch monsters, where even apparent allies are not to be fully trusted. Every danger must, eventually, be confronted. But Elden Ring differs from its predecessors in its expanse: every hillcrest represents a fresh opportunity. If one path seems too foreboding, one dragon too fearsome, one group of cackling dancers too disconcerting, you can simply ride off in another direction. The rhythms of struggle, setback, perseverance and, finally, triumph familiar to any player of Miyazaki’s work are present here, and exquisitely refined. But the frustrations have been eased; there is always another alluring path wending into the horizon, another cave entrance hidden in the bushes, another mineshaft down to a subterranean cathedral city.  This is an ancient world. Old battles have left scars on the earth: toppled statues, rotting fortifications, charred ground where the grass is yet to regrow. Game of Thrones’s creator George RR Martin provided Elden Ring’s history, a narrative foundation on which Miyazaki and his team have carefully built. But don’t expect House Lannister-style intrigue; this is not a story game in any traditional sense. There are no tedious cinematics to endure. Any character you meet who wants to talk, rather than fight, will offer only fragments of clues about the world and your purpose within it. What is clear, however, is that Elden Ring wants you dead or banished, and you must scavenge whatever resources and alliances you can to resist extinction. Newcomers have much to learn, but Elden Ring is a more welcoming game than its predecessors. While there are hundreds of different weapons to find and forge, even your chosen character’s starting arsenal, once improved by the relevant blacksmith, will remain workable for dozens of hours. Provided you’ve wooed them correctly, friendly characters or other players can be summoned to provide support during the most challenging battles with the game’s hellish monstrosities, and it’s now possible to conjure a variety of spectral warriors to provide additional backup. As in Miyazaki’s previous games, you are never entirely alone in Elden Ring. The ghostly outlines of other players occasionally flicker on-screen as you roam its world. Later, hostile players may enter to hunt you – and others can be summoned to your defence. Combat in Elden Ring is unmatched by any other game, with a sense of heft and precision that rewards patience and learning, whether battling with weapons or spells. You can fight on the ground or, if you prefer, on horseback, galloping around a foe before retreating to a safe distance. Your steed, Torrent, is a revelatory introduction, clambering sheer rockfaces like a mountain goat, enabling thrilling getaways with his pace and nimbleness. It is possible to gallop across a misted lake, wake and draw a dragon from the mouth of the cave it guards, then dip inside, loot the treasure from horseback, and make your escape. Miyazaki and his team prize secrets, and opening up the world has multiplied the possibility for riddles, conundrums and treasure hunts. There is a deep sense of wonder and excitement whenever you happen upon a cave mouth on some out-of-the-way shoreline that leads to a warren of trinkets – and the ghostly graffiti that other players can leave to point others toward these points of interest has never been more useful. Miyazaki’s worlds have always felt like elegant contraptions, with secret passages and delicious shortcuts that provide “ah-ha” moments as the architectural logic is revealed. That sense of watchmaker’s vision is only heightened by Elden Ring’s expanded scale, and minute details (the skeletons who, once reformed from a pile of bones, tap their heads down into place) ensure Elden Ring delights from every angle. It is not an accomplishment in itself for a game to be large, or long. An algorithm could theoretically toss off a virtual universe, and another could fill it with busywork. It is inane to equate scale with value and enrichment. Elden Ring’s hills, valleys, mountaintop settlements and underground palaces offer something far rarer: true texture, variety, and long-term intrigue. This is a massive world, astonishingly rendered (the sun and moon wheel in the sky, casting each scene anew) and seemingly limitless in its creative diversity. It is an unrivalled feat of design and inventiveness. For Miyazaki, Elden Ring represents the actualisation of a vision he and his team have refined for more than a decade. Technology has finally provided the power to meet their expansive imaginations. Video games can be all kinds of different things, representing all manner of artistic ambitions. Most, however, share a common goal: to conjure a compelling fictional reality, filled with beckoning mysteries, enchanting secrets, and enriching opportunities to compete and collaborate. They aim to provide a liminal space in which a determined player can fix that which is broken, order that which is chaotic. By this definition, at least, Elden Ring is the finest video game yet made. Its final gift is the assurance that, whatever monsters lurk in a broken world, with perseverance and cooperation, they too can be overcome – all without losing the mystery and wonder that makes our existence beguiling, infuriating, and fascinating. Elden Ring is released on 25 February; £49.99.",Arts/Games,Elden Ring review – an unrivalled masterpiece of design and inventiveness,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/23/elden-ring-review-an-unrivalled-masterpiece-of-design-and-inventiveness
2/24/2022,"Donald Trump has said that Vladimir Putin is “very savvy” and made a “genius” move by declaring two regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states and moving Russian armed forces to them. Trump said he saw the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis on TV “and I said: ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine … Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.”  The former US president said that the Russian president had made a “smart move” by sending “the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen” to the area. Trump, a long-term admirer of Putin who was impeached over allegations he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless it could help damage the reputation of Joe Biden, praised the Russian president’s moves while also claiming that they would not have happened if he was still president. “Here’s a guy who’s very savvy … I know him very well,” Trump said of Putin while talking to the The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show. “Very, very well. By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. “But here’s a guy that says, you know, ‘I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent’ – he used the word ‘independent’ – ‘and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.’ You gotta say that’s pretty savvy.” Trump’s intervention was criticized by the two Republicans serving on the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, who are among the few Republicans who have been critical of the former president. Liz Cheney tweeted that Trump’s statement “aids our enemies. Trump’s interests don’t seem to align with the interests of the United States of America.” Adam Kinzinger, meanwhile, retweeted a screenshot from the House Republicans that showed Biden walking away – which was captioned with the comment: “This is what weakness on the world stage looks like” – to denounce it in fiery terms. Kinzinger wrote: “As still ‘technically’ a member of house Republicans, let me, with all my might, condemn this damn awful tweet during this crisis. You can criticize policy but this is insane and feeds into Putins narrative. But hey, retweets amirite?” During a lengthy speech on Monday that questioned Ukraine’s right to exist, Putin said he recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine’s east – the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) – and that Russian troops will be sent there for “peacekeeping operations.” The move has been roundly condemned by western leaders as a dangerous escalation of the tense situation at the border between the two countries and a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said that Putin’s declaration was “nonsense” and that Russia was “creating a pretext for war”. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said that Russia was “plainly in breach of international law” by trying to break off the two territories. Other than Cheney and Kinzinger, most other Republicans and leading conservative figures have vacillated between condemning Biden as being weak in his response to the situation and claiming that Putin is being vilified in a conflict that should not interest the US. “Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America’s foreign policy,” said Tucker Carlson, the rightwing Fox News host on Tuesday. “It’s the main thing that we talk about. Entire cable channels are now devoted to it. Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in eastern Europe.”",News/US news,Trump praises ‘genius’ Putin for moving troops to eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/trump-putin-genius-russia-ukraine-crisis
2/24/2022,"Scotland Yard’s leadership has hit back at Sadiq Khan’s ousting of the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Cressida Dick, claiming “due process” was not followed by the mayor of London and calling on the home secretary, Priti Patel, to review her alleged unfair treatment. Sir Stephen House, the Met deputy commissioner and a close ally of Dick, made the comments against Khan, who publicly clashed with Dick earlier this month.  It followed revelations about hate messages circulating among officers at Charing Cross police station from 2016 to 2018. The mayor was angered that nine of them were still serving in the Met, with two promoted, one of whom had committed misconduct. Dick was pressed to come up with a plan to deal with the huge problems facing the Met, and in the mayor’s view failed to do so. Dick then decided to resign. House told the London assembly’s police and crime committee that the mayor played to the media rather than following a process set out in law. He said: “I feel deeply disappointed. There’s a clear procedure in statute laid down to allow the removal of a police chief officer. It’s not been followed in this instance; it’s not even been initiated in this instance. “Due process has not been followed, and instead we’ve seen matters played out in the media. Because of this, I’ve written to the home secretary to ask her to have a review carried out of the events that have taken place.” House’s comments make public the simmering anger among Dick and her allies at the mayor’s rejections of her reassurances she was doing enough to tackle the Met’s confidence crisis. He said Khan had recently been a “strong advocate” for Dick, believing she should have a three-year extension to her term in office, not the two years the home secretary granted her in September 2021. House said the mayor’s office for policing had been briefed months ago about the Charing Cross scandal, which came after a series of outrages that have sapped public confidence in policing and caused mounting concern in government. Khan is also the police and crime commissioner for London, a role delegated to a deputy mayor, Sophie Linden. She and House clashed over official confidence figures, with House citing one saying 75% had confidence in the Met while Linden cited a number that showed a drop in confidence across a range of measures since Dick was commissioner. Most crucially, 51% thought their local officers were doing a good job, down from 68% just before Dick took over. House said Dick was “the outstanding police officer of her generation”. A spokesperson for London’s mayor dismissed House’s attack, saying Khan’s actions were entirely proper: “The deputy commissioner’s comments about due process are entirely incorrect. “The commissioner took the decision to step aside having failed to come up with a substantive plan that gave the mayor confidence she could root out the serious cultural issues in the Met, and regain the trust of Londoners. “Her decision removed the need for the mayor to follow the statutory process. “There is a precedent for this series of events. Ian Blair resigned as commissioner in 2008 following the loss of confidence in him by the mayor at the time.” The mayor at the time was Boris Johnson. The spokesperson for Khan added: “The mayor is now working with the home secretary on the process to appoint a new commissioner at the Met, who understands the scale of the problem and who will take the necessary action to restore trust in the service.” It is yet to be announced when Dick will stand down as commissioner. The rancour and turmoil at the Met comes as it investigates the prime minister and others over parties breaching their own lockdown rules. House said the Partygate investigation was expected to take weeks and not months, and added that questionnaires sent to those believed to have attended rule-breaking parties were now being sent back to detectives and assessed to see if fines were merited.",News/UK news,Senior Met officer attacks Sadiq Khan over Cressida Dick exit,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/23/senior-met-officer-attacks-sadiq-khan-over-cressida-dick-exit
2/24/2022,"The governor of the Bank of England has called on businesses to show restraint when raising their prices, after he came under heavy criticism for saying workers should not demand big pay rises to help manage inflation. Andrew Bailey said that he recognised his call for workers to show restraint in the annual wage-bargaining process was unpopular, but warned that there were risks of an upward spiral for inflation taking hold.  However, in a conciliatory response to questions from MPs on the Commons Treasury committee, he said the same point also held true for firms planning price hikes to protect their profit margins. “I’m not saying people should not take pay rises. I did make the point it was in the context of large pay rises. And my concern is the second-round effects. If everybody tries to get ahead of the shock we’ve had from outside, then we’ll get the second-round effects and it will get worse. That’s the problem,” he said. Asked by the Labour MP Angela Eagle whether big companies and City bankers should exercise similar restraint, Bailey said: “The same point holds on restraint. [It] holds for everybody.” The Bank’s governor said he was worried that current high rates of inflation, caused by soaring energy prices, could persist for longer if workers and firms tried to offset the shock by significantly raising their incomes. This could create “second round effects” to the initial shock from higher energy costs. However, Bailey struggled to answer when asked how much he was personally paid compared to the median UK wage of £31,285. “[It’s] substantially higher. It’s somewhere over £500,000, I can’t tell you exactly what it was. I don’t carry that around in my head,” he told Eagle. The Bank’s governor was paid £575,538 including pension in his first year in the job from March 2020. This is more than 18 times the UK average pay, which remains below the 2008 financial crisis peak once inflation is taken into account, making this the weakest period for wage growth in 200 years. Bailey’s comments earlier this month earned him a rebuke from No 10 and drew a furious response from trade unions. Bailey told MPs he would agree to visit a care home to see how low-paid workers were managing with the rising cost of living. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for me as governor of the Bank of England to make an observation about the pay level of a particular group in society. [But] I will take my governor’s hat off for a moment. My mother was in a care home for several years, I have close experience. I have enormous respect for people who work in care homes. It is a very, very difficult environment for people to work in,” he said. Britain’s biggest banks have reported a bumper bonus season fuelled by a rise in profits, while several companies have warned they will push up the price of their goods and services due to higher costs. The Bank’s governor said he was most concerned that poorer households would bear the brunt of persistently high rates of inflation. “It’s those with the least bargaining power in the labour market that lose out in this situation,” he said. “In a process where there are people trying to offset the shock to real income, some people will be better able to do it than others.” Asked by the Labour MP Rushanara Ali about the risks to higher levels of inflation, Bailey said that rising tensions between Russia and the west over Ukraine had pushed up global gas prices – which risked feeding through into the cost of living.",News/Business,Bank of England boss asks firms to show restraint when raising prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/bank-of-england-boss-andrew-bailey-asks-firms-to-show-restraint-when-raising-prices
