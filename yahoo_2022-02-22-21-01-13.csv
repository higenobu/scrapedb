2/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s oil refinery near New Orleans exploded into flames on Monday, threatening to crimp fuel supplies and raise pump prices at a time of already rampant inflation.

Marathon said five people were injured. The blaze that started around 9:30 a.m. local time was declared extinguished about 4 1/2 hours later. The fire occurred in a hydrocracker, according to a person familiar with the operation, a crucial price of equipment that breaks heavy petroleum molecules down into lighter products such as diesel. If any damages are significant enough to halt production at the Garyville complex, regional fuel supplies may be stretched. Benchmark gasoline futures rose 1.6% on news of the fire. Demand has been on the rise at a time when more than 10% of Gulf Coast refining capacity already is idle for repairs and other maintenance work. Retail gasoline prices have climbed 7.5% this year, adding to 2021’s 46% advance, according to AAA. The last time prices were this high was the summer of 2014, when international oil prices were above $100 a barrel.

2/22/2022,"Inflation is making these nervous times for anyone who invests in stocks and bonds. But there's no need to lose your cool. With the rate of inflation having risen to 7.5%, highest in 40 years, is it best to stay the course or to bail out in search of higher returns with other investments? Based on research, certified financial planner Ray LeVitre believes he has the answer. LeVitre, who founded the Net Worth Advisory Group in Sandy, Utah, took a close look at bursts of inflation over nearly a century. Most of those periods came and went within a couple of years, often followed by solid rebounds. But one of the most troublesome periods was the sustained inflation of the 1970s, which led LeVitre to examine it closely to see what lessons it holds for today. Between 1973 and 1982, the annual inflation rate never fell below 5.8%. In four of those years, it exceeded 10% – a far cry from the 3% annual inflation rate on average since 1926. ►Profit during inflation?: These 5 tips could help investors beat rising prices To anyone holding stocks, the onset of the inflationary spiral was devastating to portfolios. Investing $10,000 entirely in a mix of stocks – from large cap growth to small cap value – in 1972 would have shrunk by $3,935, nearly 40%, within two years, LeVitre's analysis shows. But from there, it would start to rebound. It would take until 1976 to pass $10,000 again but by 1982, it more than doubled to $22,827. It's an impressive-sounding gain and it came close to matching inflation over that 10-year span, falling only $111 short. Investing $10,000 entirely in a mix of bonds – no stocks or cash – would have resulted in falling $1,275 behind inflation. And going entirely to short-term instruments by buying only Treasury bills also came close to beating inflation. Investing in a 50-50 mix of stocks and bonds, however, would have provided investors with the asset mix necessary to beat inflation, LeVitre said. During the 1970s, those investors would have managed to have come out $209 ahead. For purposes of the study, the hypothetical stock portfolio would have consisted of various index funds, evenly split between growth and value. It included 50% large caps, 20% mid caps, 10% small caps and 20% in foreign stocks. Nothing exotic. His conclusion? “What’s interesting for this period is is that each portfolio I tested had pretty similar returns and kept up with inflation with varying amounts of volatility,” LeVitre said. ►Investing amid inflation: Here's how to save on taxes and survive a stock market slump As such, it’s a case for holding the line. But not all would agree. A study released last year by the London-based investment management firm Man Group found that commodities performed best overall during eight inflationary periods studied. Stocks performed poorly and bonds offered weak returns. And clearly, the nation’s current situation has some major differences from past inflationary periods. In the 1970s, the nation was reeling from an oil export embargo by Arab countries to protest U.S. support of Israel in 1973’s Yom Kippur War, stagnant economic growth that gave rise to the term “stagflation” and later in the decade, gasoline shortages that caused long lines at stations and drove up prices. Today, the U.S. is an oil exporter nation itself, no longer as dependent on oil from the Mideast and elsewhere abroad. The current bout of inflation follows government intervention in the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic and comes after a series of big government stimulus packages to try to keep the economy purring. Critics say, however, they ended up feeding inflation. The Biden administration has insisted inflation will be temporary. The Federal Reserve is expected to attempt the delicate task of starting to raise interest rates to head it off as soon as next month in a manner that won’t trigger a recession. There’s no way to know when the inflationary spiral will end, but LeVitre believes there is enough evidence to support the case for sticking by traditional investments. Investors won’t make a killing by any means during prolonged inflation, but at least they can tread water or come out slightly ahead. “I would stay with stocks. I would continue doing what you’re doing with your diversified portfolio,” he said. This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: What assets do best in inflation?

2/22/2022,"Mortgage rates surged to the highest level in two years, leaving homebuyers on high alert as further increases loom. “Things aren’t going back down,” DLB Financial Services CEO Debbie Boyd told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “So we have to quit thinking this is a bubble and just start thinking that this is it now. This is the real thing.” The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage — the most common loan for homebuyers — increased to 3.69% last week from 3.55% the previous week. That’s the highest level since January 2020, according to Freddie Mac, and well above the average of 2.73% a year ago. The surge in rates followed an increase in 10-year Treasury yields, which rose above 2% for the first time since 2019 this week. Solid employment growth for January and a high inflation report are likely to accelerate the Federal Reserve’s plan to increase benchmark interest rates to combat inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. “I think we're going to have three, maybe four hikes this year. Doesn't mean they're all going to be huge,” Boyd said. “But even an eighth of a point, or a quarter of a point does trickle down through the markets, and it makes everybody nervous.” Though recent rate increases have helped fuel homebuyer sentiment to plummet, the housing market has remained red hot. “If you need a new house, you're going to go buy a house. If you're moving across the country and have to relocate, you're going to be buying a house,” Boyd said. “It doesn't matter what the price is.” The average sales price across the country for an existing single-family home rose 14.6% to $361,700 in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. As a result, entry-level homebuyers generally spent up to 25.6% of their household income on mortgage payments, further straining affordability for young buyers. “Real estate markets are caught in a lopsided dynamic with many buyers eager to find the right home before rates rise even higher, but very few available homes for sale as a result of almost a decade and a half of underbuilding,” said George Ratiu, Realtor.com’s manager of economic research. “The benefits that ultra-low interest rates provided over the last two years are wearing off and affordability is becoming a huge hurdle for many buyers.” Still, rates are historically low. By comparison, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage reached an all-time high of over 18% in 1981, according to Freddie Mac. “We are used to now historically low interest rates. I remember when I got a 5.50% rate several years ago, like 10 years ago, and that was a great rate,” Boyd said. “So it's all in what we're used to. We've forgotten that rates were higher than 2% at one time.” While rising mortgage rates will likely price out many young and moderate-income first-time homebuyers, now could be a good time to lock in a rate if you want to refinance or are looking to invest. Homeowners rushed to refinance their mortgages in January during a three-week break from rate increases that added more than a half-point to the 30-year fixed rate last month. “Call it a preemptive strike of getting a refinance in place before mortgage rates run any higher,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, previously told Yahoo Money. Last week’s increase in rates cut down the population of high-quality refinance candidates who could shave three-quarters of a point from their mortgage to 5.1 million, according to figures mortgage technology and data provider Black Knight previously gave Yahoo Money. That’s down from 5.9 million the previous week. So now’s the time to refinance. The same holds true for any real estate investors, Boyd said, before rates climb to 4% in the second half of the year. “So you're going to be buying a little bit more expensive with a little more expensive money. But it's not going to get cheaper,” Boyd said. “So if this is the market you want to get in, you need to get in now.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money.

2/22/2022,"Thanks to continued fear and uncertainty, the stock market is heading down lately. The escalation of Russia's threat to invade Ukraine comes at a time when the market is already vulnerable given inflation worries and growing expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The NASDAQ is down 13% so far this year, while the S&P is just a whisker north of correction territory, at a 9% loss. It’s no secret that you can find some tasty morsels at the bottom of a river or a lake or a shallow sea – but you can also find some excellent stocks at the bottom of a market trough, too. Fortunately, there’s a trick to finding them. Just look for the right signals: strong ratings and solid upside potential come to mind, but so does a bullish outlook from the corporate insiders. The insiders are just that, people on the ‘inside’ of a company, with access to information that the retail investor usually can’t get. Insiders are typically corporate officers, and they carry a heavy responsibility to both Boards of Directors and company shareholders to maintain profits and increase share values. They don’t take their stock trading lightly, and for investors, this means that insiders’ purchases aren’t just a signal on a stock’s prospects – they’re often a brilliant 1000-watt flashing neon sign. And when those insiders start picking up beaten-down stocks, the ones hanging out at the bottom of the pond with the catfish, then it’s time to really take notice. We’ve done just that, using TipRanks’ Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to pick out two stocks that have seen recent ‘informative’ action from the insiders – and that are trading at bottom-level prices. Here are the details. Crocs (CROX) We all know Crocs, those foam clogs that brought ‘ugly chic’ to footwear and sparked a whole line of shoes – the signature clogs, sandals, sneakers, even more formal shoe styles. Crocs offers us an example of a company that has survived and thrived by branching out from its initial breakthrough product – without losing its original brand. Crocs can be found in more than 90 countries worldwide, and the company has sold over 720 million pairs of shoes since its debut in 2002. It's not just the company’s lifetime aggregate that makes for good numbers. Crocs has been consistently beating the analyst expectations on revenues and earnings since the middle of 2020, and the most recent report, for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021, was no exception. The company reported $586.5 million at the top line, just edging over the $585 million forecast, and showed a total of $154.9 million in earnings, for an adjusted EPS of $2.15 – where analysts had been predicting $1.98. On a full-year basis, Crocs’ results were record-breaking. The company reported an impressive $2.31 billion in revenue for 2021, up 66% year-over-year, and, for the first time, exceeding $2 billion annually. Even with those big gains, however, investors were disappointed with Crocs’ outlook which factored in supply chain snags and came in below Wall Street’s expectations. Crocs shares have been falling since November; the stock peaked above $180, but is down 56% since then. Turning to insiders, we find that the corporate officers are willing to buy in at current prices. Two company directors, Douglas Tref and Thomas Smach, have made ‘informative buys’ in recent days, for considerable sums. Tref bought 8,100 shares, spending more than $740K. Smach made a larger purchase, spending $1.066 million to pick up 12,356 shares. These insiders are not the only ones bullish here. Jonathan Komp, 5-star analyst with Baird, sees opportunity for investors here. He writes: “We have been impressed by CROX's multi-year efforts to improve operations, drive higher operating performance, and unlock significant growth potential globally. As a stand-alone story, we have held a very favorable view of the company's ability to deliver a +low-20% EPS CAGR through 2026E based on plans to emphasize digital, product innovation, and ESG initiatives among other factors."" ""We see an improved risk-reward following the Q4 report, since we think investor sentiment regarding the sustainability of growth for the core Crocs brand and current operating margin, as well as the potential for upside relative to 2022E HEYDUDE assumptions could become more clear. Looking on a one-year-out basis, assuming CROX can achieve our current estimates, we see a compelling return potential,"" the analyst added. To this end, Komp puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on CROX, and his $200 price target suggests a one-year upside of a hefty 152%. (To watch Komp’s track record, click here) The consensus view on CROX shows that Wall Street, generally, is upbeat on the shares. The stock gets a Strong Buy rating, based on 9 reviews with a 6 to 3 split in favor of Buys over Holds. The share price is $79.26, and the average target, at $178.13, indicates room for ~125% appreciation in the year ahead. (See CROX stock analysis on TipRanks) Albemarle Corporation (ALB) Now let’s take a turn to the chemical industry. Albemarle, a North Carolina-based company, is a maker of lithium and bromine products, and is the world’s largest provider of the lithium needed in electric vehicle (EV) battery packs. The company has a global operations network, with facilities and ops in the US and Europe, Chile, Australia, the Middle East, and East Asia. Albemarle presents us with a difficult picture to interpret. The company reported its 4Q and full year 2021 results earlier this month – and the numbers were roughly in-line with the Street’s expectations. For 4Q21, the top line of $894 million was a shade below the $894.5 million forecast, while the bottom line of $1.01 for adj. EPS was slightly better than the 99-cent estimate. For the full year, the company reported revenues of $3.3 billion, up 6% from 2020. The trouble comes in, however, with the full-year earnings. GAAP EPS, at $1.06 per share for the year, was down 70% from 2020, and the company’s free cash flow turned negative. These are the factors that spooked investors and helped push the stock down by 20% in the subsequent session. But should they have got that sort of beating? Albemarle has been pursuing an active expansion/acquisition strategy, which has left the company cash-poor for now – but in a position to expand production to meet expected increased demand in coming years. Investors should remember that, according to industry experts, lithium production can take up to two years to ramp up. Albemarle appears to be preparing for that now, rather than waiting to scramble when new orders come in. A look at some recent announcements helps to tell the story. In January, Albemarle signed a development agreement with 6K, a leader in microwave plasma technology, for the exploration of novel lithium battery materials and a possibly disruptive new manufacturing process. And in February, Albemarle signed a non-binding agreement with Mineral Resources Limited on the potential expansion of the MARBL Lithium Joint Venture. Albemarle’s insiders appear sanguine on the stock. Last week, Netha Johnson, President of the company’s bromine specialties, bought up 1,060 shares, spending just over $199K on them. In the second purchase, Kent Masters, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board, made a purchase of 5,241 ALB shares for $999,983. In the meantime, 5-star analyst Colin Rusch, of Oppenheimer, believes the company is setting itself up for future gains. He says of Albemarle, “We note that management's increased estimates for lithium demand through the end of the decade may prove conservative as EV production continues to ramp and as power infrastructure integrates a higher percentage of renewables capacity augmented by energy storage. We believe some investors may be concerned about inflationary pressures on ALB's production costs, but we believe the company will be in a position to not only pass those costs on over time but also to enjoy substantial operating leverage.” Based on the above, Rusch rates ALB shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $307 target implies a 12-month upside potential of 61%. (To watch Rusch’s track record, click here) All in all, ALB holds a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 15 reviews including 9 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at $253.67, suggesting a 33% upside potential.
