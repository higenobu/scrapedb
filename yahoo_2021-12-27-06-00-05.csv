12/27/2021,"A woman trying to reach Atlanta before Christmas ended up in FBI custody after she caused a mid-air “disturbance” that injured fellow airline passengers and the Delta flight crew, according to the Atlanta Police Department. It happened Dec. 23 on Delta flight #2790, which left Tampa, Florida, at 4:30 p.m. and arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at 6:10 p.m. Atlanta police officers were waiting when the flight landed “in reference to a disturbance call involving an unruly passenger,” officials said in a Dec. 25 press release. “When the aircraft arrived at the gate, officers were able to meet with exiting passengers who advised that the suspect, Ms. Patricia Cornwall had caused a disturbance while in the air,” officials said. “This disturbance (led) to the injury of fellow passengers and Delta employees. Based on the statements gathered and visible evidence, officers detained Ms. Cornwall and contacted the on-call FBI agent.” Cornwall was taken to an Atlanta police precinct and later taken into custody by the FBI, officials said. Details of what caused the disturbance and the extent of injuries were not released. A video recorded on a Tampa-to-Atlanta Delta flight was tweeted Dec. 24 by ATL Uncensored/Atlanta News, and it shows a woman standing in the aisle cursing at a seated male passenger. Crew members are seen trying to restrain the woman, who slaps the man across the face and tells him multiple times to put on his COVID-19 face mask. (She has her mask pulled down below her chin in the video.) Someone in the video reports a woman “went crazy on the airplane, punched this man in the face, spit on him, scratched him (and) poured hot water on my leg.” The Justice Department on Nov. 24 directed U.S. attorneys general to prioritize cases against those who “endanger the safety of passengers, flight crews and flight attendants.” “Passengers who assault, intimidate or threaten violence against flight crews and flight attendants do more than harm those employees; they prevent the performance of critical duties that help ensure safe air travel,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release. “Similarly, when passengers commit violent acts against other passengers in the close confines of a commercial aircraft, the conduct endangers everyone aboard.” Family argument ends with dad killed and son seriously hurt, North Carolina cops say Sheriff’s office shares grim photo after Alabama deputy’s ear was ‘torn and bitten’ Murder suspect found dead and naked in woods after break-ins, stabbing dog, NC cops say",U.S./Macon Telegraph,"Fight on Delta flight from Tampa to Atlanta ends with multiple injuries, police say",https://news.yahoo.com/fight-delta-flight-tampa-atlanta-181232637.html

12/27/2021,"President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that if NATO does not provide binding guarantees to curtail military deployments in Eastern Europe and to bar Ukraine from membership in the alliance, he will be forced to consider a variety of options, including a military response. Putin's demands are contained in a pair of draft treaties Russia submitted to NATO earlier this month. POLITICO reported that Putin, whose remarks aired on Russian state TV Sunday, expressed concerns about the possibility of missiles being deployed in Ukraine if the former Soviet satellite joins NATO. ""We have nowhere to retreat,"" Putin said. ""They have pushed us to a line that we can't cross. They have taken it to the point where we simply must tell them; 'Stop!'"" When asked about the exact nature of the response he was proposing, Putin said it would ""depend on what proposals our military experts submit to me."" NATO is unlikely to agree to Putin's terms. ""NATO member countries decide who is a member of NATO, not Russia,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, according to The Washington Post. President Biden has threatened increased sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. The Russian military announced Saturday that more than 10,000 Russian troops had returned to their bases after a month of drilling on the Ukrainian border, Reuters reports. Despite this reduction, Russia still has tens of thousands of troops stationed on the Ukrainian border, and intelligence analysts continue to warn that an invasion could be imminent. Russian state media frequently refers to Ukraine as ""a colony of the West"" and smears Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, without evidence, as a drug addict, according to BBC.

12/27/2021,"COLFAX, Calif. (AP) — A major Christmas weekend storm caused whiteout conditions and closed key highways amid blowing snow in mountains of Northern California and Nevada, with forecasters warning that travel in the Sierra Nevada could be difficult for several days.  A 70-mile (112-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 80 was shut Sunday from Colfax, California, through the Lake Tahoe region to the Nevada state line. The California Department of Transportation also closed other mountain routes while warning of poor visibility and slippery conditions for drivers.  “Expect major travel delays on all roads,” the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nevada, said on Twitter. “Today is the type of day to just stay home if you can. More snow is on the way too!” The weather service issued a winter storm warning for greater Lake Tahoe until 1 a.m. Tuesday because of possible “widespread whiteout conditions” and wind gusts that could top 45 mph (72 kph). Rockslides caused by heavy rain closed more than 40 miles (64 kilometers) of coastal Highway 1 in the Big Sur region south of the San Francisco Bay Area. There was no estimate for the reopening of the scenic stretch that is frequently shut after wet weather. The latest in a series of blustery storms hit Southern California with heavy rain and wind that flooded streets and knocked down power lines late Saturday. Powerful gusts toppled trees, damaged carports and blew a track-and-field shed from a Goleta high school into a front yard two blocks away, according to the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. No injuries were reported.  More than 1.8 inches (4.5 centimeters) of rain fell over 24 hours in Santa Barbara County's San Marcos pass, while Rocky Butte in San Luis Obispo County recorded 1.61 inches (4 centimeters), the weather service said.  Los Angeles International Airport said a “storm-related electrical issue” forced a partial closure of Terminal 5, causing post-Christmas passengers to divert to other terminals for certain services.  “Cancellations and delays are possible, so it will be important to check your flight status today if flying through Terminal 5,” LAX tweeted. In the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles, crews were repairing a section of State Route 18 that washed down a hillside after heavy rain late Thursday. The closure of the major route into the Big Bear ski resort area could last for weeks, officials said.  The continuing storms were welcomed in parched California, where the Sierra snowpack had been at dangerously low levels after weeks for dry weather. But the state Department of Water Resources reported on Christmas Eve that the snowpack was between 114% and 137% of normal across the range with more snow expected. Friday night into Saturday, 20 inches (50 centimeters) of snow fell at Homewood on Lake Tahoe’s west shore. About a foot (30 centimeters) was reported at Northstar near Truckee, California, and 10 inches (25 centimeters) at the Mount Rose ski resort on the southwest edge of Reno.",U.S./Associated Press,"Major storm dumps snow, closes mountain routes in California",https://news.yahoo.com/major-storm-dumps-snow-closes-175235806.html
12/27/2021,"Naren Gupta, a venture capitalist who co-founded Nexus Venture Partners to help plant Indian SaaS startups on the world map, died on Saturday. He was 73. Gupta, who moved to the U.S. to pursue higher education in late 1960s, co-founded Integrated Systems, a software firm that was ultimately sold to Intel. After leaving the firm, Gupta began exploring investment opportunities. “My introduction to venture capital and investment was really accidental,” he said in a podcast last year. “I really had no plans to do it. But the opportunity seemed good, and I met lots of entrepreneurs and once in a while, I made investments.” One of the earliest investments Gupta made was in an Indian startup, which against his urging, agreed to an acquisition offer. The deal made Gupta realize that if he had a formal venture fund, his portfolio startups would be in a position to take longer-term bets. “That’s why I got interested in venture in India. In 2005 and 2006, I made a number of trips and met hundreds of companies,"" he recalled in the podcast. It was a bold bet. There were very few startups in India at the time and far fewer investors willing to back them. Nexus, additionally, was focusing on startups that solve problems faced by large enterprises. Its bet was that enterprises across the globe would find the solutions relevant. ""Technology really does not follow any political boundaries. What we were able to do early on was bring the U.S. norms and approach to building companies and mix that with the Indian talent and Indian capability to get things done. India is very entrepreneurial at getting things done,"" he said. The fund he co-founded in 2006 was Nexus Venture Partners, which today operates over $2 billion assets under management. Nexus has backed several promising startups including API platform Postman, online classifieds platform Olx, coding platform WhiteHat Jr, and edtech Unacademy. Gupta also served as a chairman of the board of Red Hat prior to the firm's acquisition by IBM. Sumanth Raghavendra, a Bangalore-based entrepreneur, said in a tweet that several generations of Indian startups owe Gupta “a debt of gratitude.” He embodied everything positive that a founder looks for in an investor, always backing founders unconditionally, especially when they were in a tough spot. — Kunal Bahl (@1kunalbahl) December 26, 2021 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js “Naren was a stalwart in the global technology and entrepreneurial ecosystems and a pioneer of Indian venture capital.

12/27/2021,"Beijing might have seemed like the best option at the time. The International Olympic Committee needed somewhere to stage its 2022 Winter Games after several European capitals withdrew from bidding, scared away by the risk of hosting and paying for a multibillion-dollar sports event. The only remaining suitors were Beijing and the little-known city of Almaty in Kazakhstan. When IOC members convened in July 2015 to cast their votes, the Chinese capital prevailed by a slim majority. “This is really a safe choice,” IOC president Thomas Bach said, predicting the winner could reliably “deliver on its promises.” Seven years later, as the Feb. 4 opening ceremony draws near, Bach and his colleagues still are paying the price for selecting a host country with a reputation for human rights abuses. Their standard line — sports and politics live in separate worlds — has failed to quiet global condemnation from activists, human rights organizations and some athletes. Though threats of a multinational boycott have abated, the U.S. government has led a string of democratic countries in declaring a lesser “diplomatic boycott,” meaning they will protest by refusing to send representatives to the competition. “We will not be contributing to the fanfare of the Games,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, went a step further in dubbing Beijing “the Genocide Games.” :: The last thing these Olympics needed was another distraction. In the wake of last summer’s Tokyo Games, the IOC faces yet another competition with strict COVID-19 restrictions and fears of an outbreak among athletes and coaches from around the world. But concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant have taken a backseat to political strife. China has attracted criticism for its treatment of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities, with reports of indoctrination camps and cultural erasure leading to claims of genocide. Crackdowns on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and aggressive policies directed at Tibet, Mongolia and Taiwan have drawn further censure. This month, Tibetan students protested by chaining themselves to the Olympic rings outside the IOC’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that allowing Beijing to serve as host city this winter “makes a mockery of the Olympic Charter, which states that the Games should seek to foster ‘respect for universal and ethical principles.’” There is historical precedent for politics intruding on the Games. Three European nations withdrew from the 1956 Summer Olympics in response to the Soviet Union’s crushing of the Hungarian Revolution. In 1976, more than 20 African and Arab countries refused to participate in a protest related to South Africa’s apartheid policy. More famously, the U.S. led a 65-nation boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games to protest the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan and the Soviets retaliated by skipping the 1984 Los Angeles Games. The Biden administration settled on a less-severe diplomatic boycott because, Psaki said, “I don’t think that we felt it was the right step to penalize athletes who have been training and preparing for this moment.” Britain, Canada and Australia followed suit. The fallout has extended beyond geopolitics, with Human Rights Watch calling for corporate sponsors to address human rights violations; other groups have demanded that NBC not televise the Games. The Olympics have become increasingly vulnerable to this type of controversy because of their cost. Oslo dropped out of the running for 2022 after its ruling parties declined to support a bid they deemed “so expensive.” Stockholm cited “too much speculation with taxpayers’ money” in making a similar decision. As bids in democratic countries give way to political concerns and public referendums, authoritarian nations can step forward with promises to pay the hefty tab, no questions asked. Beijing spent a reported $40 billion when it hosted the 2008 Summer Games. Russia topped that with an estimated $51 billion in 2014. “The Olympic family has put its faith in Beijing again to deliver the athlete-centered, sustainable and economical Games we have promised,” the nation’s bid committee said in a statement. :: It was early November when Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai accused a former Communist Party leader of pressuring her to have sex. As the scandal went viral, she vanished from public view. Her disappearance raised fears, given the growing list of Chinese officials, celebrities and activists who have gone missing after criticizing party figures or speaking out against national policies. The timing was especially bad for IOC leaders. Bach arranged a 30-minute video call with Peng, sharing only a still photograph of their meeting and a brief statement. “She explained that she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time,” the statement read. “That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now.” Things got even more muddled last week when Peng denied to a Singapore newspaper that she ever said she was sexually assaulted, calling it ""a lot of misunderstandings."" In the weeks since this started, Olympic leaders have continued to defend going to Beijing. Bach dismissed the diplomatic boycotts by saying “we have our full focus on the athletes … the rest is politics.” China was predictably sharper in hitting back against the U.S. and others. With the 2028 Summer Games set for Los Angeles, party officials hinted at a replay of the American-Soviet tit-for-tat in the 1980s. “The U.S. will pay a price for its practices,” said Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. “You may stay tuned for follow-ups.” With less than two months to go before the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, helped the IOC’s cause by accepting an invitation to the Games. France, which will host the 2024 Summer Olympics, has done likewise and many European Union countries are reportedly hesitant to decline for fear of hurting trade relations with China. “I don’t think we should politicize these topics, especially if it’s to take steps that are insignificant and symbolic,” French President Emmanuel Macron said. “To be clear, you either have a complete boycott, and don’t send athletes, or you try to change things with useful actions.” :: Facing repeated questions about competing in China — a familiar theme at news conferences this fall — U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee officials stuck to the IOC’s line of reasoning. “We strongly believe that the governments of the world, including our own, and the respective diplomatic teams and experts, should lead the conversation about international relations,” USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said. “We’re still trying to stay in our own lane.” This balancing act has been trickier for athletes, some of whom have strong personal opinions. “I can say human rights violations are abysmal,” ice dancer Evan Bates said. “We’re human beings too and when we read and hear about the things that are happening [in China] … we hate that.” But, like others, Bates stopped short of calling for a full boycott. He would like to believe that staging the Olympics in Beijing might “shed light on this topic.” Luge racer Tucker West put it another way. “It’s not my job to decide where the Olympics are,” West said. “So I’m going to show up to Beijing.” For 17 days in February, China will have the opportunity to showcase its new arenas and ski resorts as well as a multibillion-dollar, high-speed railway line connecting the city to distant mountains. There will be scenes of joyous athletes and cheering crowds — only domestic spectators will be allowed — telecast worldwide. Representatives from more than 70 of the 90 countries expected to participate in the Games recently  attended a diplomatic briefing to hear about Olympic venues and schedules. Organizers spoke at length on coronavirus protocols designed to keep the competition safe. IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch, who served as a liaison between his organization and China, expressed confidence that the Games would be “extraordinary.” He did, however, acknowledge the last few years have been “a very long and complicated journey.” This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",World/LA Times,The ugly side to China hosting the Olympics has taken center stage.
