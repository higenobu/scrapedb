12/12/2021,"Ministers announced a huge expansion of the booster vaccine campaign on Saturday night, amid warnings that further restrictions will be needed imminently to prevent tens of thousands of deaths. With new Covid measures being discussed in Whitehall and claims of people being turned away from booster walk-in centres, third jabs will be opened up to those in their 30s from Monday in England. Those who had their second jab three months ago or more will be eligible.  It follows a warning from leading scientists that failure to impose tougher Covid restrictions to limit the spread of the Omicrom variant could lead to a further 25,000 to 75,000 deaths over the next five months. The researchers, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, predicted that a massive wave of infections was likely to sweep the nation in January. At best, this could lead to about 175,000 hospital admissions and 24,700 deaths by the end of April next year. However, under their most pessimistic scenario, there could be up to 75,000 deaths and a total of 492,000 hospital admissions – the latter figure being almost twice as high as the peak of hospitalisations that were seen in January 2021. It would put a struggling NHS under severe strain. The team behind the study said the actual outcome will depend on how well the Omicron variant escapes vaccine protection and how effective booster jabs are at restoring protection against the virus. “We may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed,” said Dr Rosanna Barnard, co-leader of the study. “Mask-wearing, social distancing and booster jabs are vital, but may not be enough. Nobody wants to endure another lockdown, but last-resort measures may be required to protect health services.” But the government’s prospects of successfully imposing new restrictions on the public were questioned on Saturday by senior behavioural experts. They have warned that reports of Downing Street parties, where Covid rules were allegedly flouted last year, have caused widespread anger and resentment. “It is always more difficult to re-apply restrictions because people are fatigued and generally fed up,” said Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at Edinburgh University. “But now it’s going to be even harder, because trust has been eroded to a very significant level. People are really fed up with the government. And if you don’t trust the government, why would you do what the government asked you to do?” Bauld said it was likely that far more people would flout rules if they were asked to limit numbers allowed indoors at one time, as happened last winter. “Many are likely to say: I’m fed up, I don’t trust this government, and I want to see my friends and family, so I’m just going to ignore the rule.” The government is also under extreme pressure from its own backbenchers over the imposition of plan B measures last week. Boris Johnson faces his biggest-ever parliamentary rebellion on Tuesday, meaning that the restrictions are likely to be enshrined in law only with Labour’s support. The rebellion will make it harder for Johnson to impose further measures should they be recommended in the days ahead. Whitehall sources said that time was needed to see what effect the measures already imposed had on the course of the virus. An additional 633 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant were reported across the UK on Saturday, according to the UK Health Security Agency. It brings the total number of confirmed cases to 1,898. While 30- to 39-year-olds will be able to book their booster from Monday, under-30s have been turning to online forums to find vaccination centres willing to ignore government guidance and offer them the jab. On Reddit, nearly 25,000 people are a member of the UK community GetJabbed, where they are sharing locations of clinics in cities such as London, Manchester and Liverpool offering boosters to younger people. One poster linking to a vaccination clinic in Essex said that they were offered the jab within five minutes of arriving, “no questions about age or living in the area”. Another reported getting a jab in Smethwick, near Birmingham, while other under-40s said they had been vaccinated on Saturday in Woking, Basildon, Hounslow and Bristol. Labour also claimed that on current trends, the government was on course to miss its target of giving everyone a booster jab by the end of January. “The NHS should continue to prioritise those most at risk, including the elderly, housebound and care home residents, but there is no reason others who are eligible and keen to get their booster vaccines now should be turned away,” said Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary. “We want to make sure everyone can enjoy Christmas safely this year, as well as protecting our NHS. The best way to do that is boosting the booster campaign.” An NHS spokesperson said: “NHS sites are expected to vaccinate those most at risk from the coronavirus first in line with JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] guidance – which at present is people aged 40 and over, as well as those with health conditions and healthcare workers, but this will be extended to over-30s from Monday. “The NHS is rapidly mobilising to ensure people are offered lifesaving protection as quickly and as safely as possible so when you are called we strongly advise you to get your booster jab.” Health chiefs warned that the NHS was now under such stress that further prioritising boosters would have an impact elsewhere in the service. “The NHS will obviously do all it can to speed up the booster injections if that’s what’s needed,” said Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts. “But we need to recognise the complex logistics involved, as the government’s chief medical officer stressed [last] week. “We also need to recognise the wide range of other pressures the NHS is under. Amazing though our staff are, they can’t deliver the impossible. As we saw [last] week with GPs and over- 75 health checks and new patients, we are now at the stage where prioritising a new pressure means deprioritising somewhere else.” Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University, added that Omicron was now spreading so fast that people were now “very likely” to meet someone infected with the Covid-19 variant. As a result, a lot of people could still end up in hospital even if the coronavirus mutation proves to provoke milder symptoms than the Delta variant, as some researchers have suggested.",News/World news,Scientists fear falling trust in Boris Johnson could harm bid to curb Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/scientists-fear-falling-trust-in-boris-johnson-could-harm-bid-to-curb-omicron-surge

12/12/2021,"There is a contrarian view of Britain’s economic outlook. Those who subscribe to it argue that despite fresh government restrictions to combat the Omicron variant, the recovery is robust and the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates when it meets this week. It is a minority view in the City, but it could find favour inside Threadneedle Street when members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) gather, and bring a surprise increase in the base rate from 0.1% to 0.25%.  Three-quarters of investors are now betting on rates staying where they are, but Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, is not among them. “Fundamentally,” he says “news of the Omicron variant has changed very little on the medium-term economic outlook.” He points out that inflation is high and heading above 5%, there are record job vacancies and unemployment has continued to fall, even though the furlough scheme ended abruptly at the end of September. Over at the Bank of England, several hawkish policymakers believe that without higher borrowing costs to calm price increases, workers might start seeking double-digit wage rises, triggering a wage/price spiral and raising the spectre of soaring inflation into 2023 and beyond. George Buckley, chief economist at Nomura, asks: “Does the Bank really want to be in a position in two to three months’ time where inflation has risen further, the virus is once again in retreat, and yet it has failed to get policy rates off the ground?” The only reason for another delay would be if Office for National Statistics figures, due this week, shortly before the MPC meets, show a deterioration in the labour market, in particular a rise in unemployment or a slowing of wages growth. “The labour market is of course the only key data point between now and [the] meeting that could change things for us,” says Raja. Most economists in the Square Mile have cut the odds of a rate rise in response to the working from home directive issued by Downing Street. A dramatic slowdown in the UK’s GDP growth in October to just 0.1% – amid flagging business and consumer confidence before the government’s restrictions – is another factor that could weigh against a rate rise. That could mean Bank policymakers are forced to admit that rather than taking the lead among central banks and being the first to increase borrowing costs since the pandemic started, they will play the same game as the Bank of Japan, the People’s Bank of China and the European Central Bank (ECB), and keep credit ultra-cheap. There is a consensus in the City that the ECB, which also meets on Thursday, will reject calls for tighter monetary policies, especially from Germans afflicted by annual inflation already running at 6%. ECB president Christine Lagarde has sought to calm those concerned by rising prices, telling them inflation is “transitory” and tighter monetary policy will do little to depress inflationary pressures that date back a year or more in the supply chains of carmakers, laptop assemblers and timber importers. The US economy is the outlier. It has raced back to rude health on the back of a huge government stimulus package. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said recently that inflation was “not transitory” and Fed action was needed to tame rising prices. After US inflation hit 6.8% in November, its highest level since 1982, analysts now expect four or even six rate rises by the end of 2023. But US economic growth has begun to wane, and Omicron could prove devastating for the large numbers of unvaccinated Americans. The outlook remains uncertain.",News/Business,An interest rate rise in Omicron times?

12/12/2021,"Conor Benn took a significant step up the ranks of the welterweight division, which is the most competitive category in contemporary boxing, when he stopped the American veteran Chris Algieri with a finish of clinical brutality near the end of the fourth round in Liverpool on Saturday night. It was a devastating stoppage, which was greeted ecstatically by Nigel Benn, Conor’s father, who roared his approval at ringside. Almost as impressively, the 25-year-old Benn boxed with a new maturity and calm throughout the contest. He also showed good defence as he slid away from Algieri’s punches with such alacrity that the crowd responded with appreciative applause. But from the outset, the contest looked one-sided as Benn backed Algieri against the ropes. The older fighter stuck his tongue out in the opening round as if he had nothing to fear but at the break his cornermen were already trying to curb the swelling around his eyes.  Algieri went down for the first time in the second round when a cuffing left hook caught him off balance. He tumbled heavily to the canvas and rolled towards the ropes but Algieri looked more aggrieved than hurt as he was forced to take a standing eight count. Benn retained his discipline through the next two rounds and, in the finest performance of his career so far, he sealed his 20th straight victory with authority. He forced Algieri to retreat to the ropes and, with 10 seconds left in the fourth round, produced his stunning knockout. A left jab down the pipe was followed by a perfect right hand which made Algieri crumple forward, in slow motion, before falling face first towards the canvas. It was a worrying knockout but, fortunately, Algieri was helped to his feet after a few minutes. Benn consoled him but it was a sad end to Algieri’s career. Beyond Benn’s impressive improvement, this was a skilful piece of matchmaking. Algieri is well known in America, where he now works as a boxing pundit, and he remains in excellent condition. He had also lost only three bouts in his previous 28 contests and those defeats had been against Manny Pacquiao, Amir Khan and Errol Spence. Pacquiao and Spence are supreme talents and Benn has never faced a fighter of their calibre. Algieri used to be a solid pro and he would once have been a real test for Benn. But he is now 37. Victory over a faded Algieri does not mean Benn is ready to fight the prodigies of the division. Jaron Ennis and Vergil Ortiz are the two most intriguing young welterweights in boxing and Eddie Hearn, Benn’s promoter, knows that he needs to keep his fighter away from such gifted company in the immediate future. Spence and Terence Crawford, the two kings of the division, offer an even more formidable threat. They are so good that they are both in the top five pound-for-pound rankings. Benn is hungry and intense, and he carries real power allied to his new composure, but he is still some way from being ready for any of the premier American welterweights. At least beating Algieri so decisively allows him to believe he is closing the gap which separates him from the very best in his red-hot division. In the other headline bout, Ireland’s Katie Taylor, the undisputed world lightweight champion, won a clear decision on all three scorecards against Firuza Sharipova – her unheralded but tough opponent from Kazakhstan. Taylor has had some hard and testing bouts in recent years while compiling her flawless 20-0 record and she would have hoped for an easier night. Sharipova, who had exuded feisty confidence all week, came to win and she was ready to resort to roughhouse tactics to try to unsettle the far more experienced champion. But Taylor was willing to trade, trusting her faster hands against the technically sound and rugged challenger. The champion was far from her best but early in the second round she backed up Sharipova and caught her with a sharp left. In the corner after the round, ice had to be applied to a swelling to Sharipova’s left eye. But Sharipova remained full of ambition and she won some rounds with her aggressive and determined boxing. She seemed undeterred by the cut over her left eye which bloodied her white top. She was intent on turning their battle into a dogfight and in the sixth round she was warned and deducted a point for hitting Taylor after they were told to break. There was plenty of brawling and Taylor looked a little flat but she still did the more accomplished work – although Sharipova won the eighth to show that she was still trying to find a way to win. But in the ninth Taylor snapped back Sharipova’s head with some accurate counters. The last of these landed just as the bell rang and the 27-year-old fighter from Kazakhstan smiled wearily at the champion. Sharipova came out fast from her corner for the last round and flurries of punches were greeted by whoops from her corner. But Taylor was still in control and, amid the grappling and brawling, she landed a final few combinations in mild rebuke of her spiky opponent. Taylor had told me a few weeks ago that, while knowing little about her opponent, she expected that Sharipova would have excellent technical skills – as most fighters schooled in Kazakhstan are good technicians. Sharipova matched that prediction, with added dollops of hostility and grit, but there was little doubt that Taylor had won the decision. The way is now clear for Taylor to fight Amanda Serrano, the great Puerto Rican, in the most lucrative contest in the history of women’s boxing. There are legitimate expectations that both Taylor and Serrano will make more than a million dollars when they meet in the ring next year. That will be a contest of great significance and, with Christmas looming and after a testing year, the 35-year-old champion deserves a break from the ring after another bruising if decisive victory.",Sport/Sport,Conor Benn’s demolition of Chris Algieri earns roar of approval from Nigel ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/conor-benn-demolition-chris-algieri-boxing
