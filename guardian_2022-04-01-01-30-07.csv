4/1/2022,"An innovative universal sound for e-scooters is being developed by scientists at the University of Salford working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People (RNIB) to help pedestrians hear the oncoming vehicles. The silent motors of e-scooters can be dangerous for people who expect to be able to hear hazards approaching on roads and pavements, and the researchers have gained funding to explore a range of audible motor sounds to find one which is sufficiently noticeable to help safety, while being pleasant for those around, and avoiding unnecessary urban noise pollution. Dr Antonio J Torija Martinez, the project’s principal investigator, said: “Based on initial research, we found that the addition of a well-designed acoustic signal can significantly increase vehicle awareness and ultimately safety.” Working in conjunction with e-scooter hire company Dott, the researchers will now explore the impact of different songs on users and the public across Europe, working with international blind associations. Rather than simply playing a uniform tone, the project is exploring the possibility of a scooter making an artificial sound that reflects its speed and thrust, matching the expectations people already have based on experience with petrol engines. “Light electric vehicles pose a significant safety hazard to many people with sight loss,” said Robin Spinks, Strategic Lead Innovation Projects at RNIB. The researchers deployed a mathematical measurement of the annoyance and pleasantness of various sounds in an effort to find the best option for the scooters: something too annoying would be inappropriate for use in a busy city but something not annoying enough might risk being hard to notice in an emergency situation. Then, the best candidates for the note were put through an experimental trial. Test subjects were placed in a VR environment, and told to press a button on a controller as soon as they detected a moving hazard; at the same time, they were given a brief passage of text to read and answer questions on, to simulate the distraction of a busy street. In the end, the winning sound was a “broadband” sound – one containing an even mixture of noise in both low and high frequencies – mixed with a “modulated tone”, a clear single note distorted slightly. The mixture mimics the sound of a car, which has a broadband noise generated by the tyres on the road, and a tonal sound generated by the engine itself. The work follows on from a trial carried out by TfL in January 2020 to explore the possibility of playing a similar warning sound for electric buses travelling at low speeds.",News/UK news,Scientists creating e-scooter sound to help blind people detect them,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/scientists-creating-e-scooter-sound-to-help-blind-people-detect-them
4/1/2022,"In the past, he would have been able to send publicans to the stocks for inflating the price of beer because everyone, including the children, drank it. “Unfortunately I don’t have those powers,” said the UK’s newest official “ale taster”. But there will be perks. “The role will certainly involve tasting ale. Or I bloomin’ well hope so,” joked Paul Boswell. “They’re not paying me so I hope I’ll get something out of it.” Boswell was speaking after being appointed this week as ale taster for Congleton in Cheshire, part of celebrations marking 750 years since it received its charter. In 1272, the charter meant four appointments could be made: mayor, town crier, catchpole (debt collector) and ale taster. It was an important job, Boswell said. “The ale taster’s role was basically a combination of trading standards and weights and measures to ensure that the proper ingredients and quality ingredients were being used and they weren’t overcharging for the beer.” Because of the perils of drinking water, most people then drank ale, said Boswell. That included children, albeit about 1 to 2% strength, he said. “It was about making sure the quality of the beer was good and it was a fair price – and if people fell foul of that, they were fined or sent to the stocks.” Boswell will not do that but he does see his role as helping to promote the town’s night-time economy, which is, like everywhere, recovering from a tough two years. One plan is to develop an ale trail around the town’s hostelries. Congleton is a town that prides itself on the quality of its pubs and beer and being a place to unwind after a hard working day. In the 1600s, people came in large numbers to the town attracted, unfortunately, by the quality of its bear baiting. When the bear died, the town’s Bible, it is said, was sold in order to buy a new bear. Today, Congleton, still known as Beartown, goes to lengths to help charities around the world rescuing bears. The town’s brewery is called Beartown and one of its beers is Kodiak, named after the sort of bear thought to have been kept in the town 500 years ago. An ale taster outfit has been made by local historian and costume maker Jenny Unsworth. Boswell, who moved to Congleton last year, spent 35 years working in the brewing industry before retirement. That and his passion for medieval history made it an obvious job to apply for, he said. He was sworn in this week at a ceremony in the Beartown Tap in which he read an oath from 1272. The ceremonial role is for one year only and future engagements will include a medieval banquet and fayre and the town’s annual food and drink festival. As ale taster he will adopt the name Benedict Goodale, he said. “Benedict means ‘blessed’ and of course Congleton is blessed with lots of good ales. I just felt that Paul Boswell doesn’t sound very medieval so we thought I should have a persona I adopt when I put this silly hat on, basically.”",News/UK news,Only here for the beer: Congleton appoints ale taster for town anniversary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/congleton-appoints-ale-taster-to-mark-the-towns-750th-anniversary
4/1/2022,"Greta Thunberg is releasing a new book this autumn, which aims to offer a “global overview of how the planet’s many crises connect”. “I have decided to use my platform to create a book based on the current best available science – a book that covers the climate, ecological and sustainability crises holistically”, Thunberg said in a statement. “Because the climate crisis is, of course, only a symptom of a much larger sustainability crisis. My hope is that this book might be some kind of go-to source for understanding these different, closely interconnected crises.” In The Climate Book, which is due to be published by Penguin this autumn, Thunberg has assembled more than 100 contributors, from scientists Johan Rockström and Katharine Hayhoe to economist Thomas Piketty and novelist Margaret Atwood. The 19-year-old also shares what she has learned from her own experiences of climate activism. In particular, she discusses the prevalence of greenwashing, revealing the extent to which we have been kept in the dark about the issue. She names this as one of our biggest problems, but also our greatest source of hope – because, she believes, once we are all given the full picture, we will be able to act. “Right now, we are in desperate need of hope”, Thunberg said. “But hope is not about pretending that everything will be fine.” She added: “To me, hope is not something that is given to you, it is something you have to earn, to create. It cannot be gained passively, through standing by and waiting for someone else to do something. Hope is taking action. It is stepping outside your comfort zone. And if a bunch of weird schoolkids were able to get millions of people to start changing their lives, just imagine what we could all do together if we really tried.” Since 2018, when Thunberg, then 15, started her now famous school strike, the Swedish teenager has been calling for stronger action to be taken against the climate crisis. She has become a worldwide celebrity and figurehead of the environmental activist community, becoming the youngest Time Person of the Year in 2019 and being nominated three times for a Nobel peace prize. She has previously published three books, two co-authored by her parents and sister: Scenes from the Heart and Our House Is on Fire, and one collection of speeches, No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference. This new book is set to be her most comprehensive work yet, pulling together ideas and knowledge from experts with a view to “equip us all” to make positive change. “Greta has proven herself to be one of our finest and most galvanising new writers”, said Chloe Currens, Thunberg’s editor at Penguin. “In a series of sharp, insightful and impassioned chapters, which knit the book’s different parts together, she shares her own experiences and responds to what she’s learned.” Currens went on to call The Climate Book “unique” and “alive with moral purpose”. It “aims to change the climate conversation forever” she said. The Climate Book is due to be published in the UK on 27 October 2022, with a US release planned for early 2023.

4/1/2022,"Beijing has expelled its high-profile former justice minister and deputy police chief from the ruling Communist party, denouncing him as being “extremely despicable” and accusing him of befriending “political frauds”. Fu Zhenghua – who had reportedly helped bring down China’s former security chief Zhou Yongkang a few years ago – has been removed from public office over serious violations of party discipline and laws, said the state news agency Xinhua in a brief announcement that attributed the decisions to Beijing’s top anti-graft body. The Chinese version of Thursday’s announcement – which has since been widely publicised across China’s tightly controlled media – hinted Fu’s case was related to that of Sun Lijun, who was last year accused of extreme “political ambition” and leading a corrupt and extravagant life. “[Fu has] never been loyal to the party and the people; [he has] participated in Sun Lijun’s political gang; [he has] befriended several ‘political frauds’ for a long time,” the announcement said. Last October Fu was placed under investigation for “serious violations”. Dr Ling Li, an expert in Chinese politics and law at the University of Vienna, said that the fact that the case had now been transferred to the procuratorate for prosecution “shows that the investigator is satisfied with whatever evidence they have obtained for the criminal charge and the prosecution”. Once a rising political star, Fu, 67, was appointed in 2013 to lead the investigation into China’s former security chief Zhou, who was jailed for life in 2015 for abuse of power and corruption. Fu’s role was regarded by some Chinese politics observers to possibly indicate a close relationship with the top leader, Xi Jinping.",News/World news,Top Chinese ex-official expelled from Communist party in latest purge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/top-chinese-ex-official-removed-from-office-in-latest-purge-fu-zhenghua
4/1/2022,"There is a stark disconnect between how well the Home Office thinks it is doing at transforming itself into a more compassionate organisation and the extremely modest progress external observers believe the department has actually made. Four years on from the government’s first apologies for the Windrush scandal, the publication of yet another critical investigation into the Home Office followed a well-worn pattern. A forensic summary of the department’s outstanding problems was met with cheerful declarations from ministers and officials suggesting that things were going pretty well. Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary, said he was pleased the report recognised the “significant progress made” in transforming the Home Office. Priti Patel, the home secretary, said the publication “highlights many achievements, including the work we have put into becoming a more compassionate and open organisation”. After four years of critical investigations into Home Office failings on Windrush, these familiar declarations that everything is more or less fine have become increasingly wearisome and decreasingly plausible. As a civil servant, Wendy Williams is balanced and thoughtful in her conclusions: she acknowledges that some progress has been made and offers a scattering of damning faint praise, noting signs of “slight cultural change”. It is understandable, she adds, that “in an organisation as large as the Home Office, the scale of change envisaged in my report takes time”. But overall her tone is one of muted disappointment. She makes it very clear that insufficient progress has been made in areas that really matter. There was limited evidence that a compassionate approach was being adopted, a migrants’ commissioner (empowered to stand up for migrants’ rights) has not been appointed, a target-driven approach remains, and the department has shown little progress in improving the way it engages with the public. Williams detected complacency. The Home Office has a tendency to overstate the amount of progress it has made, she noted, warning that it faces a tipping point, where it can either continue the efforts it has begun to take to implement change, or it can “sit back, rest on its laurels, be self congratulatory”. At a time when concern is mounting about the Home Office’s slow progress in issuing visas to Ukrainian refugees who are trying to flee a warzone, and when there is growing unease about elements of the nationality and borders bill that will criminalise refugees who arrive by unauthorised routes, a reminder of the Home Office’s slowness to reform feels very timely. But it is important to be clear about who is to blame. Some of these failings may be down to cultural and bureaucratic problems within the department, but others simply reflect government policy. Despite promising to review its hostile environment policies (now rebranded compliant environment measures), the Home Office has not done this. The vital question not addressed by the report is: how can the Home Office transform itself into a compassionate department when some of the policies it is being required to implement are designed not to be? Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights director at Amnesty International UK, points out that ultimately officials are just required to implement policy. “If that policy is oppressive or insensitive to the realities of the people to whom it is applied, it will sustain an oppressive and insensitive culture,” he said. “There is little officials can do to change this unless the policy is radically rethought and revised – and currently ministers show every inclination to do the very opposite.”",News/Politics,Home Office’s claims of compassion ring increasingly hollow,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/31/home-office-claims-compassion-ring-hollow-analysis
4/1/2022,"Everyday life is punctuated by song. There’s the nonsense you sing to keep the baby entertained on the changing mat, the earworm you hum while washing up, the current favourite that you blast out in a traffic jam, and the inaudible mumbling emanating from a stranger’s headphones. Then there are the songs we sing communally at religious ceremonies, royal events and with arms round each other at the end of parties. Without realising it, we are constantly digesting and regurgitating narratives, recalling history and finding our place in the world through words set to a melody. What Let the Song Hold Us wants to know is, what happens to us if the song is loosened from its usual confines – if its conventions are altered or the lyrics question identity instead of reaffirming it? Larissa Sansour and Søren Lind are two of the artists trying to find out, fusing Palestinian and European music practices to create an Arabic-language opera. Elsewhere, Korakrit Arunanondchai and Alex Gvojic create a narrative of both fact and fiction, while Rae-Yen Song’s choral echoes move from understanding into feeling. For most of the works in this group exhibition, a transcript is published online. This is important because it’s unusual – beyond subtitles – for the words of artists’ films to be made so readily available. “Transcript” could really be replaced by “song sheet”, because just as it is the words that imbue a song with its meaning, so the text in these pieces stand as the central motif. It is vital that we absorb the words, so much so we can go back – even after we can no longer see the artwork – and re-read them. Sansour and Lind’s three-channel video As if No Misfortune Had Occurred in the Night follows Palestinian soprano Nour Darwish as she roams a crumbling temple. The dramatic cinematography is arresting, but it is the content of the song that elevates the piece. “Each tragedy shared with those still unborn / My blood delivering the words / I forbid myself to speak,” sings Darwish, playing the role of a Palestinian mother who has lost her daughter. The reference to “blood” emphasises the close bond between parent and child and also the way in which trauma passes from one generation to another. Aretha Franklin’s version of Bridge Over Troubled Water plays over Zinzi Minott’s exploration of the Windrush Generation in Merseyside. Suddenly the vocals stop, replaced by an upbeat track that accompanies people dancing in a modern-day kitchen. Like the disjointed music, the visuals are glitchy, creating a patchwork of experiences and influences, reflecting the alteration of a cultural identity when it is displaced and marginalised. Footage of joyous dancing is offset by discussion around the uncertain future of a Caribbean community centre and violently rushing water, creating a work that celebrates both the endurance and precariousness of a group of people. “It’s true that the remit of memory is theoretically infinite,” says Tessa Norton in her installation, Dark Circles. “But in practice, its capacity is limited to just three generations. The fourth generation back might as well be the fortieth.” Like Minott, Norton uses song – or spoken word – to search for an identity that has been affected by the British empire. Exploring the ambiguity of Anglo-Indian heritage, Norton sets her immersive piece in the limbo of a traditional railway waiting room. Sitting on a bench beneath flickering lights, we watch three female performers crackling in black and white as Norton speaks to us of our inability to fully understand the nature of time and space, and our place within it. “The nature of who we are and where we fit in is only as solid as a beam of light,” she points out. Norton’s conversational tone is soothing, but the content is probing, highlighting the discomfort generated by oppression over generations. “Sometimes you just need to know when to be quiet. Do you know what I mean?” she asks at the end, which really could apply to any of the works in Let the Song Hold Us. The show asks us to put aside for a moment all those songs we carry inside us – all the ideas we have about our identity and history – to consider someone else’s experience. Even Ebun Sodipo’s Following the Gourd, an interactive website rather than a stereotypical “song”, offers the Black trans community the opportunity to dictate their own stories through a collection of sound snippets and collages from pop culture. When it does get noisy again, and I start to listen to music on the train home, the songs from Let the Song Hold Us stay with me, adding a new dimension to my previously mindless consumption, questioning the narratives I am absorbing and the world I’m approving.

4/1/2022,"Just a few weeks ago, Nadine Dorries had almost shed a tear during a Commons statement as she praised the efforts of BBC and Channel 4 journalists in reporting the war in Ukraine. For someone who has spent most of her career trashing the BBC and Channel 4, this was a rare slip. The culture secretary is a good hater. She doesn’t forgive and she doesn’t forget. Just as soon as the war is over she will revert to type. It will be like Lyse Doucet and Matt Frei never existed. As part of her campaign to single-handedly bring down the BBC, Dorries had originally tried to nominate the former Daily Mail editor Lord Dacre – a one-man war on anything even vaguely liberal – as the new chair of the media regulator, Ofcom. This proved too much of an ask for the selection panel, who refused to ratify his appointment and Dacre stormed off in a huff, even when Dorries tried to get him to apply for the job a second time. For a man who prides himself on being hard and non-PC, he’s surprisingly thin-skinned. He can dish it out, but he can’t take it. Dacre’s replacement was never likely to share his total, pathological lack of sensibilities, but Dorries must have thought that in Michael Grade she had found a more than adequate second best. A Tory peer who seemed to share her anti-woke agenda. Someone who had complained about the BBC licence fee and had spoken out against liberal values. Best of all, he had described the BBC’s coverage of partygate as aggressive and disrespectful. It was perfectly normal for the prime minister to go to as many parties as he wanted. He made the laws and he was entitled to break them. And if Boris Johnson chose to lie about them, then that was his prerogative. Lord Grade is in for a hell of a shock when someone tells him it was ITV and the Daily Mirror who broke most of the party stories. Dorries, though, might soon be shedding a few more tears because, on the basis of his performance at the pre-appointment session of the culture select committee, Grade might not be the culture warrior she had hoped. Rather he appeared as, at worst, slightly out of touch with a few opinions, lightly held. If the committee wanted some other opinions, he had them too. He could be whatever anyone wanted him to be. He wasn’t that bothered. His role at Ofcom was to be independent and he could do that. And, in any case, look on the bright side: he wasn’t Paul Dacre. That thought seemed to be uppermost in the committee’s mind. There was nothing riding on Grade’s appearance – the meeting was entirely decorative as the committee had no powers to block his appointment – so the proceedings were good-natured throughout. No one cared enough to ask any really tough questions and Grade was intent on being as polite and uncontroversial as possible. And like him or not, you have to recognise he is an old pro. Within minutes, he had most of the committee eating out of the palm of his hand. So why had Grade chosen to apply for the job, asked the committee chair, Julian Knight. Grade paused. He had been at a loose end and had been reading the situations vacant. No one had suggested he put his name forward. Far from it. He had just realised how interested he was in the government’s online harms bill. And what social media did he use? Ah, he said. That’s what made him such a specialist in the area. Because he actually used none. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok: forget it. But his son did spend a lot of time on his phone so that probably made him an expert. Labour’s Clive Efford moved on to Grade’s comments on the licence fee. Grade looked astonished. He had never said the BBC shouldn’t be funded by the taxpayer. He merely thought it was insensitive that the corporation was asking for more money at a time when it was reporting that people were having to choose between heating and eating. No one asked him the key question of whether he thought the BBC would still be good value if the licence fee was increased. The only trace of feistiness came when the SNP’s John Nicolson questioned him on his anti-woke agenda. Calling his future Ofcom colleagues “woke warrior apparatchiks” was just office bants, Grade said. And he had previously only stood up for the right of a Freeview nostalgia channel to show an old programme from the 70s in which someone had blacked up. It was clearly an archive show. Hell, he’d been the person to axe the Black and White Minstrels and beauty shows when he’d been head of BBC1 back in the 1980s. Yes, he’d stood up for Laurence Fox on Question Time. Lozza’s grandfather had been a friend of his dad’s. And he’d only said it was good to hear different voices to be supportive. Someone had to stand up for not very bright, moderately successful actors. Besides, this would all stop once he was chair of Ofcom. Every complaint would be dealt with strictly on its own merits. As for diversity, how much more diverse could his appointment be? Who else was handing out £142K for three days a week jobs to 79-year old Tory peers? It was tough work, but someone had to do it. After that, it all went very cosy as committee members asked vague questions about other aspects of Ofcom’s remit without being very interested in the answers. It was jobs for the boys, but the boy was near enough one of them. Grade just kept things vague and genial. He’d do his best and get his head around the job when he started. There was just time for one sting in the tale, when Labour’s Kevin Brennan asked him about his West End flop, Man of La Mancha. That clearly hurt Grade. He must have lost more than he cares to remember. For his next musical, he’d be sure to cast a star who could actually sing. That was the only lapse in judgment on his CV to which he was prepared to admit.",News/Media,Michael Grade the cultural warrior goes peacenik before MPs | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/31/michael-grade-the-cultural-warrior-goes-peacenik-before-mps
4/1/2022,"A plumber who landed a record contract after he was overheard singing at work has now signed a Hollywood movie deal for the rights to his story. Kev Crane, a 50-year-old plumber from Leicestershire, was fitting a bathroom for local record producer Paul Conneally in August last year when he started singing along to the radio. Impressed by his vocals, Conneally, who owns New Reality Records in Loughborough, offered Crane a record deal and he went on to release his debut album. Now Hollywood has got wind of his story, and Crane has signed a deal with Los Angeles-based filmmaker Stacy Sherman and American screenwriter and producer Billy Ray, who wrote 2013 blockbuster Captain Phillips. A script has already been written by British sitcom and film writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who wrote for television series including The Likely Lads, Porridge and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. “It’s like I’m watching this happen to someone else. Not for one minute did I think this could happen to me,” Crane told the BBC. “I’ve had some sleepless nights thinking about this whole story – the record deal and now the film. It’s so exciting.” Conneally said: “Never in a million years did I think this would happen when I first heard Kev singing. We know the story won’t follow our life stories exactly but will be based on it, and we can’t wait to see exactly what they do with it.” The pair have been speculating about which actors might play them in the movie. Conneally has suggested Simon Pegg and Nick Frost would be a good fit. Other names that have been thrown in the ring include Jude Law, Colin Firth, Jason Statham and Ricky Gervais. “We grew up watching shows like Porridge and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet along with films like The Commitments, so it feels unreal to be now working with the creators of those and having Zoom calls with them in LA and to think it’s our story that they’re working on,” said Crane, who lives with his wife Karen, in the village of Quorn. “My wife has been so overwhelmed by it all – in tears about it. I am just going with the flow.” Sherman said she became interested in the story as it’s a tale of “the human spirit and music”. “What could be better?” she said. “Sinks fixed, dreams dashed, heartache, hope and UK music.” Crane said he had previously been in a band and had written an album but it was “more of a hobby”. “I like to sing while I am working and [Conneally] pulled me into the living room one night for a conversation about my singing voice,” he said. After listening to Crane’s music “he offered me a chance to sign up to his label – it was just like that”. For now, Crane is still fitting bathrooms around the east Midlands, but has another record out this week, and is starting work on his second album. Meanwhile, the film is in pre-production, and the pair are eagerly awaiting the final result. “We don’t have a set date for the film’s release yet. We’re learning just how much work goes into the making of a feature film, especially one made in LA,” said Conneally. Crane isn’t the only singer who was talent spotted when they were least expecting it. The Florence and the Machine frontwoman said she was discovered by Mairead Nash, who went on to become her manager, when she sang in the toilets while on a night out. In an MTV interview, the singer said: “I went to one of Mairead’s club nights and we were in the toilet talking about boys or something, and I was pretending that I had a band. “I sang a snippet of an Etta James song. I was like: ‘I can sing!!’ I was pretty drunk … But toilets have really good acoustics, and I found out that Etta James sang to her manager in a toilet as well.” Back in 1964, Stewart was playing his harmonica at Twickenham railway station after seeing blues singer Long John Baldry perform at the the Eel Pie Island hotel. Baldry heard him play and invited him to sit with his group, where he discovered Stewart could sing as well. He offered him a job with his band for £35, after securing the approval of Stewart’s mother. The now legendary rock singer built up his confidence playing with the band, before embarking on his solo career. American singer-songwriter Toni Braxton was spotted by producer William E Pettaway Jr while she was refuelling her car at a petrol station. Pettaway was working as an attendant at the Annapolis service station and recognised Braxton from her local performances, introduced himself and offered to produce her. Although sceptical, Braxton accepted the offer. When she was 14 years old, American singer, songwriter and actor Mandy Moore saved up some money to book time in a studio in Orlando to work on her music. She was overheard by FedEx delivery worker, Victor Cade, who sent a demo tape to his friend at Epic Records and Moore soon landed herself a record deal.",Arts/Film,Flushed with success: singing plumber signs Hollywood film deal,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/31/flushed-with-success-singing-plumber-signs-hollywood-film-deal
4/1/2022,"Two years ago this week, the government launched a scheme called Everyone In, which did just what it said on the tin. It provided funding to ensure rough sleepers were housed in hotels or hostels during the first lockdown. In a single stroke, it essentially eradicated Britain’s street homelessness crisis. It remains among the only positives to emerge from the pandemic, even if it was introduced to remedy an emergency the Conservatives had ignored during their previous decade in power. We hoped at the time it would be the start of a concerted, long-term plan to deal with homelessness in general and street homelessness in particular. How naive we were. A few months later the government quietly pulled the plug on the programme. Look around you now, and it’s hard to imagine that rough sleepers were living in hotels only a couple of years ago. Today, the Museum of Homelessness, which records the annual number of homeless deaths, published its latest findings – and they are horrific. In 2021, 1,286 people experiencing homelessness died in the UK. We are not talking about sofa surfers or those who have secured long-term accommodation in hostels such as the YMCA, the group that forms the vast majority of the estimated 274,000 homeless people in England alone. Instead, we are talking about the most vulnerable people – rough sleepers or people placed in emergency accommodation and other insecure settings. This is a 32% increase from the 2020 study, and a shocking 80% increase from the number registered in 2019. A freedom of information request, coroners’ report, charity or family member verified each death. The easy assumption is that many of the deaths are due to Covid. Wrong. Astonishingly, the Museum of Homelessness recorded only seven homeless people dying of Covid, showing how effective Everybody In was. (Figures from the Office for National Statistics are higher but still impressive). So what went wrong? For starters, according to Shelter, by June 2020, 77% of the 37,430 people helped under the Everyone In banner were not living in settled accommodation (somewhere they could stay for at least six months); and almost one in four were no longer being accommodated at all. Of those being accommodated, few received wraparound support to help with mental health and addictions. When we wrote The empty doorway, a Guardian series telling the stories of people who had lived and died on the streets, we found that every person we profiled experienced poor mental health and dependency. They needed access to mental health and addiction services as much as secure housing, but the Tories have stripped them to the bone. Meanwhile, 41% of the homeless deaths reported by the Museum of Homelessness were related to drug and alcohol use, while 12% were suicides. Street homelessness itself vastly increases the chance of dying young. According to the ONS, the mean age of death in England and Wales in 2019 was 45.9 for homeless men and 43.4 for homeless women, as opposed to a mean 76.1 and 80.9 for men and women, respectively, in the general population. In several cases we examined, vulnerable people were placed in independent or semi-independent accommodation when it seemed apparent to us they needed to be supported. Twenty-two-year-old Jake Humm’s body lay undiscovered for two days at a Brighton YMCA in August 2018, even though he was documenting that he was drinking himself to death on his Facebook account. Former outreach worker Sharron Maasz, 44, died in women-only supported accommodation in Oxford after staff had allowed her “boyfriend” into the building. She died shortly after he shared drugs with her. And on it went. We felt all the deaths we investigated could have been avoided. Perhaps the most alarming thing about the record number of people dying homeless is that the figures are likely to get far worse over the next few years. Those on benefits will suffer a considerable fall in living standards as benefits rise by just 3.1%, with inflation currently at 6.2%. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 1.3 million Britons will be pushed into absolute poverty by the cost of living crisis. The more people living in poverty, the more will become homeless. In February, Crisis and Heriot-Watt University forecast that more than 66,000 more people will be homeless by 2024, with the bulk of the increase being among people forced to “sofa surf”. They estimate that 8,000 more people will sleep rough and 9,000 people will be forced into unsuitable temporary accommodation. Avoiding this catastrophe is not rocket science. We made this argument two years ago and the answer hasn’t changed: restore addiction treatment budgets, take rough sleepers off the streets and introduce Housing First, where homeless people are provided with secure homes – not hostels, not shelters, but real homes of their own – and then wraparound care tailored to their needs. The government also needs to extend the remit of the Care Quality Commission, so it can investigate the homes provided by private landlords for vulnerable people. For those not convinced by the moral imperative here, know this: it costs far more to do nothing. Research conducted by Crisis found that “if 40,000 people were prevented from becoming homeless for one year in England, it would save the public purse £370m”. Boris Johnson was determined to house rough sleepers at the start of the pandemic because he was terrified of dead homeless people’s bodies lining British streets. That never happened – partly because the government acted rapidly to house rough sleepers temporarily. But if he doesn’t take dramatic action this time round, on both the cost of living and homelessness, his worst nightmare may well become a reality.  Simon Hattenstone is a Guardian journalist.

4/1/2022,"Households in the UK will see their energy bills rise by 54% from 1 April, with prices expected to rise again in six months. Despite the chancellor’s spring statement offering a fuel duty cut and changes to the national insurance threshold, people are still struggling with the cost of living. We spoke to six people about their experiences and what spiralling heating costs will mean for them. In Hull, Lee Craven, a 48-year-old support worker at a mental health charity, is running out of money at least a week before his salary is paid each month. “I often work [overtime] just to make ends meet,” he said. His electricity bill has doubled since this time last year, and that’s before the price hike comes into effect on Friday. “I think it’s going to be pretty bad,” he says. “You get to the point where you dread the post coming through the door.” By the last week of each month, Craven has run out of cash and has to get help from his parents. “I’ve got nothing – literally no money whatsoever,” he said. “I know where my money goes, it’s just going on bills. I’m not entitled to universal credit so I’m having to cut back on things like food. It’s really hard going. If it weren’t for my mum, I’d have to go to the food banks.” Last month, he disconnected his broadband, and now uses his mobile phone as a hotspot. “It’s a luxury that I just can’t afford,” he said, adding that subscriptions to music streaming platforms have also had to go. Craven used to shop at Sainsbury’s, before switching to cheaper supermarkets like Lidl and Aldi a couple of months ago because of the rising cost of food and essentials. “I used to like Sainsbury’s for the quality,” he said. “I was always budgeting my food quite well and would spend about £25 a week – now it’s about £35.” In Northampton, Will, who is retired, has seen around a 50% increase in his electricity usage since his landlord moved supplier recently after the previous one went bankruptcy. “It used to cost approximately £5 a week but it’s now gone up to about £10 depending on how cold it is,” said the 72-year-old. Will, who has been living in shared accommodation for three years, uses a prepayment meter, which he “pops coins into” when he needs to. “I probably use the electricity the most in the household. I had major heart surgery last June and the cold really affects me, and because I’ve not been well I’m virtually at home all day.” His monthly income is about £1,300, which includes his state pension and financial assistance he receives for housing and council tax. He believes he would be eligible for a warm home discount but because his landlord receives the electricity bill he doesn’t think he can apply for it. “It’s been tough. I’m having difficulty walking so at least I’ve been able to reduce my expenditure by not going out, but I’ve also been eating less. If the electricity price goes up again it will become quite a concern. We’ll just have to wait and see.” John Ellis, 31, from Suffolk, is “livid” that his monthly payment for gas and electricity will jump to £255.76 from the start of April. He said he received correspondence from E.ON in December to say it would increase to £186 from January, and it agreed he would pay £95 instead. However, in February he was told it would increase again. “I’m in a bit of a rubbish situation,” said Ellis, who works as an account manager and lives with a housemate in a two-bedroom house. “I have about £600 outstanding on my energy account that I didn’t know about, and because E.ON never increased my direct debit I’ve been accumulating debt over time. “I’m in a somewhat fortunate position in that my energy bills cost slightly less than 20% of my monthly income at the moment but if it goes up in April that would be unacceptable.” He had been with E.ON on a variable rate for a few years and was recently moved in February to its sister brand E.ON Next, which claims to supply 100% renewable energy. “It’s a bit bonkers,” he added. “We’re still discussing the April payment but I’ve told them if they try to take it I’ll cancel my direct debit. There’s no way I’m paying that much money – it’s just wrong.” Until she got a new job in further education a few weeks ago, Marie*, a 54-year-old from Liverpool, was living extremely frugally. The rising cost of living has meant she has at times been unable to afford prescriptions. “I get the lower rate of PIP [personal independence payment benefit], which I have to use for taxis to work as arthritis stops me walking the distance to the bus stop without pain. I need inhalers and co-codamol for pain and some months I haven’t been able to immediately pay for prescriptions,” she said. Although she has always worked “low-wage jobs” and is good at food budgeting, Marie began to worry when she noticed the prices creeping up, even in supermarkets “like Lidl and Aldi”. “Panic sets in and it’s scary. You go round the supermarket and you’re totting up the cost in your head,” she said, explaining that she often has to put back items at the checkout. “You’d just make sure you have toilet paper, milk and bread.” The only clothes she buys are socks and tights. “I wear shoes until they fall apart.” She said the spiralling cost of living has pushed people in her area to the brink. “I live in a poor area, and people just look like the fight’s gone out of them. It was bad enough before, but people just look so much more miserable now. I grew up under Thatcher – we thought it was bad then but things are so much worse now. We didn’t have food banks during the 1980s – now they are essential.” From next month, Christine Nebbett, a 46-year-old from Norfolk, will see her electricity bill shoot up from about £95 to £195 a month. The amount she pays for broadband will increase too. “I got an email saying my contract has ended and it’s going to go from something like £23 to £40,” she said, explaining she chose the provider “because it was really quite low for broadband – my son needs it as well because he’s at university”. “I don’t know what to do on the internet,” she said, wondering if it is “feasible” to cut it off. “That means having to apply for jobs just on a phone, and my son, when he comes back from university, still needs to study. There is no wriggle room now.” Rising costs of living have left Nebbett, who works in retail but is on statutory sick pay and universal credit, with few areas to make cuts to. “I’ve already got rid of anything extraneous,” she said. “I’ve got no Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify.” Nebbett said she is considering taking her car, which cost her about £500 four years ago, off the road. “It’s more expensive for road tax, fuel and oil because it’s an old car,” she said, but this would be difficult as she lives in a rural location with poor transport links. Although she avoids driving as far as possible, she said: “There is always something extra and unanticipated.” She recently had to use fuel to drive to get a PCR test. The unexpected trip meant she later could not afford to drive to the supermarket. “I’m going to get very cold,” said 70-year-old Mary Strode from Powys, Wales. The retired overseas development worker said she was not eligible for any government help because her house was in council tax band E. She uses oil central heating and does not pay for her electricity via direct debit. “I can’t get the council tax rebate even though I live in a house worth less than £300,000 with two bedrooms and a box room,” she said. “Apart from the holiday lets, most of the people in our village are of modest means. Council tax might work well in cities but not outside the south-east of England.” Strode, who lives on her own, said her income was less than £20,000 per annum and with no fuel price cap on heating oil, she’s going to struggle. “Heating oil is the big expense for me,” she said. “I pay about £80 a month but I’ve cut down a lot. When I last filled up in January it was 72.5p a litre but now it’s around 99p plus VAT. I still have half a tank left so I hope it lasts as I can’t afford to fill it up again.” She pays for her electricity as and when she uses it because she likes “the feeling of having things under control” rather than paying by direct debit. “It helps me try to economise,” she added. “Another thing I think I’m going to do is let a room out for the Hay-on-Wye festival – anything to help pay for the bills.” *Some names have been changed.",Lifestyle/Money,‘It’s worse than under Thatcher’: energy price rises pile pressure on UK ,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/31/energy-price-rises-uk-gas-and-electricity-costs
