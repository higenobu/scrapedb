3/8/2022,"A group of “desperate” New Zealanders with Ukrainian friends and family have called on the government in Wellington to allow visa-free travel for people from Ukraine, as other western countries loosen their entry rules to allow in more of those fleeing the Russian invasion. New Zealand’s government has so far resisted calls to change its refugee system in response to the crisis, which the UN says has caused more than 1.3 million Ukrainians to leave their country. Kostyantyn Starodub, a spokesperson for NZ Ukraine Action, has family in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, where Russian missile strikes have caused significant civilian casualties. The city is now being encircled by Russian troops and international observers fear Russia’s President Vladimir Putin may order indiscriminate shelling, as he has in other Ukrainian cities. Starodub said he had told his family to “leave any way that you can. Then we’ll figure out a way to get you here.” But according to legal advice received by his group, Ukrainian family members are unable to apply for New Zealand visas due to pandemic-related border restrictions. “This is open war,” Starodub said. “Civilians, including children, are dying every day … New Zealand doesn’t understand the [invasion’s] scope.” He said visa-free travel would help solve the problem. His group is also urging the government to introduce a fast-track visa process for Ukrainians, increase the number of visa categories available to them and create a new Ukrainian refugee quota on top of the 1,500 refugees New Zealand takes annually. “Imagine what it’s like driving through a country at war, with children and without money or a house,” Starodub said. “Being able to come and stay with family, wherever in the world they are … is far better than being in a refugee camp.” The Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March said Ukrainians were “desperate and pleading for action from the government. I’m really concerned we are repeating some of the mistakes we recently made in Afghanistan in regards to supporting families who are trying to flee before things get even worse.” The opposition National party has also urged the government to fast-track visa applications and introduce a special humanitarian visa for Ukrainians. The immigration minister, Kris Faafoi, did not respond to questions about allowing visa-free entry to Ukrainians. Instead he noted that after pandemic-related travel restrictions are lifted, which the government plans to do later this year, “Ukrainian Kiwis [will be able] to bring wider family, beyond partners and immediate dependents, to New Zealand on temporary visas”. Last week, in answer to parliamentary questions by Menéndez March, Faafoi promised to prioritise urgent visa applications and consider what “further mechanisms can be utilised within our existing policy”. But according to the minister, as of Monday last week New Zealand was considering only 106 visa applications from offshore Ukrainian citizens. Jacinda Ardern has indicated that New Zealand would consider providing help to countries surrounding Ukraine as they deal with the wave of refugees. “We do want to do more,” the prime minister said in an interview with TVNZ on Monday. Multiple other countries have introduced visa-free travel for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion. The EU has declared that Ukrainian refugees may remain in member countries for up to three years before applying for asylum. Canada’s immigration minister, Sean Fraser, announced on Thursday that the country would waive most visa requirements and accept an “unlimited number” of Ukrainians. After coming under significant pressure, the UK introduced less expansive changes which will allow the parents, grandparents, children and siblings of Ukrainian nationals in the UK to apply for visas. The UK government expects 200,000 people will be eligible to apply under the new rules. The calls come as New Zealand’s cabinet announced a sanctions bill designed to put pressure on Russia’s leaders and oligarchs. New Zealand usually implements sanctions only when called upon to do so by the UN security council, an approach that has prompted criticism, given that Russia has vetoed the UN’s attempts to criticise it. The government said the “first of its kind” bill would be rushed through parliament this week and would allow the country to freeze assets, prevent people and companies from moving their money and assets to New Zealand to escape sanctions imposed by other countries, and stop super yachts, ships and aircraft from entering New Zealand waters or airspace.",News/World news,‘Desperate and pleading for action’: New Zealand under pressure to help Ukraine refugees ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/desperate-and-pleading-for-action-new-zealand-under-pressure-to-help-ukraine-refugees
3/8/2022,"Frank Lampard might have arrived in north London hoping to end Everton’s woeful away record, perhaps even, in some of his more feverish dreams, to hear the entire ground rise as one to acclaim his expertise. In the end he kind of got some of the way there. His decisions to bring on first the Ukrainian Vitalii Mykolenko and then the former Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli were greeted with the unique generosity of a crowd that got to cheer five unanswered home goals and enjoy repeated choruses of “Lampard’s going down”. Everton’s display of defensive haplessness helped Antonio Conte’s unpredictable Spurs side appear like world-beaters, and ended in a scoreline so emphatic it left the club with a goal difference more than doubled in improvement, from plus three to plus eight. Spurs had not won consecutive league games since early December. Now they return to Manchester, where they beat City last month, to face United on Saturday having won three out of four. Everton meanwhile had not won a Premier League away game since August, part of a run of three wins in their first four since revealed to be the falsest of dawns. By the time they get another chance it will be April. Before kick-off a local youth choir took to the pitch to sing One Day, an uplifting plea for peace. “It’s not about win or lose,” they sang at one point, as a collection of highly paid athletes gathered in the tunnel for whom it still very much is, “because we all lose when they feed on the souls of the innocent.” The songwriters will not have had Michael Keane and Mason Holgate in mind when they wrote this bit, and the singers were concentrating on a conflict that makes this one look embarrassingly trivial, but some sympathy for hapless centre-backs is probably warranted when Harry Kane and Son Heung-min are in the mood and ready to tuck in. The home side, who took last week’s FA Cup tie at Middlesbrough seriously but lost it, made one change to that side, with Rodrigo Bentancur displacing Harry Winks on his return from injury. Everton, who took their Cup game against Boreham Wood less seriously but won it, made six changes to that team but just one to the side that lost to Manchester City in their last league outing, Dominic Calvert-Lewin forcing Alex Iwobi onto the bench. Everton’s England striker was never more than occasionally involved in a first half that turned fast and hard away from the away side from the 11th minute, when Tottenham set up the game’s first clear chance. Everton had been bright enough in the opening exchanges, snapping into challenges and denying Tottenham space as they tried to play out of defence, but they would be less successful at denying the hosts space when Spurs tried to play into theirs. Two goals in three minutes squeezed the spirit out of Lampard’s side. First Ben Davies played the ball down the left for Ryan Sessegnon, who accelerated away from Séamus Coleman with cruel ease before sending in a cross that was missed by Kane at the near post but ricocheted into the top corner off the knee of Keane, his marker. Then in the 17th minute Dejan Kulusevski drew Holgate away from Son before playing in the South Korea forward, who finished hard and low beyond Jordan Pickford. Few would have been surprised to see Kane and Son spearhead Tottenham’s attack, but it was at this point that Matt Doherty more unexpectedly took over. First he released Son down the left, only for Pickford to save his shot and Kane to volley the rebound wide, then the pair reversed roles when Doherty blasted an effort at the Everton keeper having been teed up by Son. Finally Doherty produced a splendid first-time defence-splitting pass to send Kane clear to extend Spurs’ lead to three. At this stage Everton’s chances, such as they were, relied on Lampard masterminding a stunning half-time transformation. Just 40 seconds after the restart Spurs scored their fourth. Sergio Reguilón had only just come on, replacing Sessegnon who had ended the first half with the physios, and his first task was to run entirely unnoticed on to Kulusevski’s low cross and pass it into the net. In the 53rd minute Calvert-Lewin had the visitors’ best chance of the night thus far, albeit not a terribly good one, sending a low shot across goal and wide. Perhaps this, finally, was the first green shoot of an Everton recovery? Absolutely nobody held their breath, but if they had it might have lasted through two decent Spurs chances and a fifth goal, all of which came within the next 90 seconds. First Son’s shot hit Jarrad Branthwaite, another half-time substitute – it was taking a Holgate clearance full in the head, rather than the mental tortures of life at the heart of this Everton defence, that did for Keane – then Eric Dier headed over. Finally, Everton gave the ball away midway into their own half, Doherty crossed and Kane scored with a beautifully measured left-foot volley.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane leads Tottenham’s thrashing of Frank Lampard’s inept Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/tottenham-everton-premier-league-match-report
3/8/2022,"Our House (ITV) starts with a tantalisingly universal nightmare. Fi (Tuppence Middleton) returns home from a weekend away, spots a removal van outside her house and steps aside to let the movers pass – only for them to turn and walk right up her path. Her house has been emptied of her belongings, and a couple she has never met are moving in. They seem as baffled as she is. They tell her they picked up the keys this morning and show her a contract that bears her signature. The idea is not as far-fetched as it might seem. Only last year, a man returned to his house in Luton after working away after neighbours reported seeing someone inside; he found it gutted and in the middle of renovations because it had been sold without his knowledge. In such an impossible situation, what would you do? It’s a good question, but one the opening episode doesn’t really try to answer. Instead, this four-parter, an adaptation of Louise Candlish’s 2018 novel, is standard ITV thriller territory, perfectly watchable, basically functional, if not particularly fresh. Whatever the TV equivalent of landfill indie is, this is it. It’s the kind of song that gets stuck in your head, because the first time you hear it, you feel as if you’ve heard it a hundred times before. Fi walks around her empty former home repeating “This is my house”, and, given that I watched every single episode of the surprise BBC gameshow hit of that name, I couldn’t help but start to sing its theme tune. We flash back to 10 years earlier, when Fi and her husband, Bram (Martin Compston), come across the house they will turn into a World of Interiors magazine spread. They are so happy and in love that they tickle each other as they strip wallpaper. The house is huge and incredible, and appears to be in London, which made me spend far more time than I should have wondering how they could have afforded it. They both have generic middle-class jobs, in offices with lumbar support chairs and big glass windows, but, even so, that house must have cost a fortune. Over the years, they have children, paint the walls dark blue, put in parquet flooring and big glass sliding doors – then they stop tickling each other. The relationship finally falls apart when Fi comes home one night to catch Bram getting up to some excessively neighbourly behaviour in the shed. Fi is the model of dignity here. As a portrait of divorce, it is all very respectful. She knows she doesn’t want to take Bram back, despite his pleading. They attempt to separate in the least disruptive way possible for the sake of their boys by “birdnesting”, which involves renting a flat across the road, and taking it in turns to live in the house, so the children don’t have to move. “This is not an intimate relationship, it’s a practical arrangement,” says the woman tasked with drawing up a contract for them. The same could be said of this first episode, which is so level-headed it’s crying out for the jolt of energy that comes towards the end, when hints of a greater deception finally, finally start to emerge. I couldn’t understand the decision to “birdnest” rather than sell the house. “We’d lose a shit ton of money,” says Fi, though house prices haven’t crashed since the financial crisis of 2008, and they had done it up to a lovely standard, so, unless someone has opened a nightclub on one side and a 24-hour kebab shop on the other, I can’t see why they wouldn’t have made enough profit to buy two equally lovely, slightly smaller houses. Their disdain for the “studio” flat they share, an ex-local authority place with a drippy tap and non-fancy curtains that is far nicer than at least 70% of the flats I lived in in London, is hilarious. But there wouldn’t be a drama if they had sold up and moved on peacefully, accepting that their relationship had run its course. And maybe the mysterious grandeur of the house will be explained in the episodes to come. There is an intriguing trail of breadcrumbs that hints at Bram’s ability to keep secrets. There are small fibs everywhere, and then, just when it appears to be a domestic drama with a property-porn twist, a bigger one explodes on to the screen. It arrives in the nick of time, and just about manages to save it.",Arts/Television & radio,Our House review – Martin Compston turns domestic bliss into a living hell,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/07/our-house-review-martin-compston-turns-domestic-bliss-into-a-living-hell
3/8/2022,"Eddie Jones has billed Ireland as favourites for Saturday’s Six Nations showdown at Twickenham, pointing to how they are the most “cohesive” team in the world and highlighting how England’s player release agreement differs from their rivals. England go into the match third in the table, a point and a place behind Ireland. Defeat would all but end their hopes of topping the pile, with a final-round trip to Paris to come. England have selection headaches with Alex Dombrandt testing positive for Covid-19 last week and not due to train before Thursday and though Sam Underhill is back in the squad, Jones said he was “a little bit off his best”. Tom Curry was, however, able to train on Monday after he was replaced at half-time against Wales with a head injury. Before last year’s 32-18 loss in Dublin, England had beaten Ireland in four consecutive matches, including two thumping wins in 2019, but Jones highlighted their autumn campaign, in which the All Blacks were emphatically beaten, as a demonstration of their progress. Jones also made mention of how Ireland reap the benefits of having just four provinces to pick from in a system in which the union enjoys far greater autonomy over the domestic sides compared with England. Specifically, Jones believes Ireland’s system is the reason why Johnny Sexton is still their first-choice fly-half at 36 and to further illustrate his point, Leinster have provided at least 10 of Andy Farrell’s starting XV in each of their three matches so far. He also made a pointed reference to the access he gets to his players compared with other nations and while Jones believes that disadvantage is diminished during a World Cup campaign, he claims it puts Farrell’s side in the box seat this weekend. “They are literally, and I say that without any hesitation, the most cohesive side in the world,” said Jones. “The bulk of their team train together for the bulk of the year. So they are very well-coordinated in their attack, they are very structured, they’re very sequenced in set-plays. And they’re tough around the breakdown. So that poses a great challenge for us. But we’re looking forward to the challenge, we’re not intimidated by any team. “Ireland are favourites for the game, they’ve been in very good form in the autumn, they’re a very settled team, well-coached by Andy Farrell. We’re in a perfect position, aren’t we? They’re flying high, we can’t get our own way or past the barrier according to most journalists. “There are teams that have a head start at the moment, but you’ve got to be good enough to overcome those. We don’t use it as an excuse, we don’t complain about it, worry about it, it’s part of the landscape of English rugby. We can only have 25 players [after] Tuesday, other players can have 42 until Thursday so it’s all different. But once you get to the World Cup campaign start, it’s all equal.” Last year’s heavy loss in Dublin was a surprise in that it came a week after England had impressed in victory over France but Jones revealed that defeat demonstrated the need to press the reset button. Neither Mako nor Billy Vunipola have played for England since – with Jones admitting the leadership group had become too Saracens-centric – while George Ford has appeared only as a replacement. “I think it indicated we’d run our race with that group of players, and had to move on,” he said. “We came off a good win against France, and had a chance to finish off that tournament well and didn’t do that. That was disappointing. With the Lions tour and the finish to that Six Nations it made it clear we had an urgent need to move the team on.” Jones also paid a warm tribute to Shane Warne, the former Australia leg-spinner who died of a suspected heart attack last week, aged 52. “I was lucky enough to meet him on a couple of occasions. I remember we had a net session with the Wallabies against the Australian side when they were right at the top of their game and Warne was right at the top. “We had a guy called Wendell Sailor, he was a larger than life character, and he was batting against [Stuart] MacGill who was the other leg spinner. And Wendell was coming in and smashing MacGill out of the nets, and Warney grabbed the ball, he winked to the blokes behind the nets and said ‘watch this’. He gave him two and floated them up and he let Wendell smash him and the third one, he bowled a bit shorter, a bit faster, and he was bowled. Then he told Wendell to go where he needs to go! Which I thought was just a great little insight into such a wonderful sportsman.” Scotland have called up Adam Hastings for Saturday’s Six Nations clash with Italy in Rome. The Gloucester fly-half was a surprise omission from Gregor Townsend’s initial squad but has now been added to the group.",Sport/Sport,Jones insists Ireland are favourites for Six Nations showdown in England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/07/eddie-jones-insists-ireland-are-favourites-for-six-nations-showdown-against-england
3/8/2022,"It may not turn you full communist by the end of its single hour, but it’s hard to imagine that new screenwriter Helen Black’s punchy fact-based drama Life and Death in the Warehouse (BBC Three) won’t help shift every viewer’s individual dial to walk to an independent shop next time they need something. It’s a grim story of the behind-the-scenes work that provides us consumers with a life of unparalleled convenience. Our stage is set in an Amazonian warehouse. I use the adjective to mean “massive” only, you understand. Although the online retail giant Amazon has been accused of and associated with many of the practices depicted in Life and Death’s tale of abused and exploited workers, it has rejected all such claims and its name – heaven forfend! – is never mentioned here. A series of opening captions says only that the recent boom in online shopping has created an invisible army of about 1 million warehouse workers, hundreds of whose experiences at various places have been used as the basis for the drama. “Some of these companies you will know, others you won’t have heard of,” it explains. Between the captions, scenes of a woman miscarrying in a toilet cubicle play out, before we move back in time to where this emblematic catastrophe began. As shift workers queue for entry outside a warehouse that serves as the main employer in a small Welsh town, two old school friends catch sight of each other. Alys (Poppy Lee Friar) is a picker – as the name suggests, it is her job to find and take the orders off the miles upon miles of shelves within as their locations come in on her handset and headphones. Unlike most, she has worked her way up to one of the rare permanent positions – held out as a spur to ambition for all, despite the vast odds against securing one – and she wears one of the coveted green vests to prove it. Megan (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) is waiting to start her first day as a management trainee, under the tutelage of senior manager Danny (Craig Parkinson, in the cold-blooded reptilian mode that brought him to public notice as the Caddy in Line of Duty) and his acolytes Donna (Kimberley Nixon, a dead-eyed mean girl all grown up) and Sean (Sion Daniel Young), who appears to have abstained from the Kool Aid occasionally while the other two drank their fill and more. In one corner of the screen we are shown the days of Megan’s probation passing. In another, we watch as the increasingly pregnant Alys’s all-important pick rate dwindles, bringing down her team’s average, which Megan now heads. Megan’s instinct to help – to shift Alys temporarily to a less demanding role, cut her the necessary slack in other minor ways – and her assumption that company policy and Danny will allow for this are eroded at every turn. From refusing to accommodate Alys’s physical needs, despite medical confirmation of the problems with her pregnancy to hauling Megan over the coals for calling an ambulance when Alys collapses during a shift (making their statistics look even worse and occasioning an item on the news), the unfolding disaster is a study in what happens when humanity is subordinated to corporate greed, the futility of individual desire or even action in a system immaculately designed to stymie and suppress it, and the true cost of cheap goods and charming convenience. Yes, it’s agitprop in the sense that it condenses many problems into a single programme and concentrates the mind on them alone, at the expense of wider context and a notional opposing point of view. And, in cramming them all in, it doesn’t have the time or space to go deeply into any of them. But that’s not the point. The point is to showcase as many injustices as powerfully as possible – by individualising systemic wrongs and making concrete intangible violations – of the spirit, of the social contract, of the endlessly unedifying effects of untrammelled capitalism. Black’s drama does this perfectly, aided by fine performances (including Aled ap Steffan as Alys’s friend, co-worker and brave union rep Devon). It covers a lot of sociopolitical ground without forgetting to make us care about the people – those 1 million and counting – who are suffering as its footsoldiers. It ends on a half-note of hope, but one that suggests that the answer – and by implication the current blame – lies in individual behaviour and change. That will surely be part of any solution, of course, but it is only collective action that will pressurise the governments that must bring about true change, that will alter society’s view on how much we will tolerate in the name of capitalism. But perhaps I’m going full communist. Perhaps a little bricks-and-mortar shopping will be enough.",Arts/Television & radio,Life and Death in the Warehouse review – the terrible true cost of online shopping,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/07/life-and-death-in-the-warehouse-review-the-terrible-true-cost-of-online-shopping
3/8/2022,"Oligarchs or kleptocrats who try to sell off property in order to avoid it being listed in a new public register may be forced to declare their details upon sale, a minister has said, as MPs vowed to toughen up a new bill targeting hidden wealth. Ministers have promised sweeping changes to toughen up the economic crime bill, which was rushed through the House of Commons on Monday, as MPs also demanded the closing of loopholes allowing the false reporting of assets. MPs also expressed significant concern about the enforcement of the new requirements, as well as new sanctions and the low budget for implementation compared with countries such as the US. The economic crime bill, fast-tracked through the Commons in a single day in response to Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, had been repeatedly delayed prior to the invasion. It targets those who hide wealth in the UK, particularly through property purchases. These include criminals and those – such as Russian oligarchs – who might be seeking to shelter illicitly acquired money. The bill will reform Companies House in an attempt to verify the identity of every company director and beneficial owner, with the aim of preventing all criminals or kleptocrats from hiding behind a UK shell company. MPs had expressed particular concern that existing owners will have up to six months to register their ownership, which could allow people to dispose of or transfer illicit assets. The bill initially put this grace period at 18 months, but a government amendment will reduce it to six. Labour has called for it to be cut to 28 days. But business minister Paul Scully said the government was minded to go further before the bill reached the House of Lords. “I’m really aware of the strength of feeling that corrupt people must not be allowed to escape the transparency that this register will bring,” he said. “I can therefore see merit in requiring all those selling property to submit a declaration of their details at the point of the transfer of land title during that transition period. And that would mean that for anyone selling, we would be giving them a zero-day transition period.” Ministers have also been asked to scrap the defence that owners did not commit an offence if they claim not to realise they have provided false information, as it must be given “knowingly or recklessly”. Scully also signalled he would address a clause that foreign owners can get an exemption if the secretary of state deems it is in “the interests of the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom”. Introducing the bill, Priti Patel, the home secretary, said the government was “determined to root out the dirty money in our economy, and importantly, to hobble Putin and his cronies”. She said a second version of the bill would come later, including powers to prevent the abuse of limited partnerships, new powers to seize crypto assets from criminals, and measures to help businesses share information on suspected money laundering. The former cabinet minister David Davis said it was not a “perfectly crafted bill” and that it had initially been designed for a different purpose. “We’re dealing with a difficult but sophisticated adversary, and we’re making decisions quickly,” he added. It was now an “economic warfare bill – a war that liberal democracies cannot afford to lose”. Kevin Hollinrake, one of the Tory MPs who has led calls to toughen up the bill, said MPs were keen to close loopholes that would allow people to subvert the legislation. “If you are a kleptocrat oligarch and you own a £20m house in Belgravia, you have probably shifted it to somebody else already, and I think the most important thing for me is we have very timely introduction of these measures,” he told the Guardian. “For me there has to be a requirement for a transfer or sale of any asset in the UK owned by an overseas entity to have to disclose the beneficial owner before that is transferred or sold. That has to be immediate.” Tom Keatinge, director at the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Treasury select committee that it had “not had the resources” to tackle economic crime. He said the UK had “suffered from a fear of being financially outgunned in court by oligarchs”. He added: “There is no one person who lives and dies on how the UK performs on addressing illicit finance. It’s fragmented across government. That is what I mean by the lack of leadership.”",News/UK news,Oligarchs selling UK property to avoid new register may have to declare details,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/oligarchs-selling-uk-property-to-avoid-new-register-may-have-to-declare-details
3/8/2022,"This pulsating tie was contested in a vibrant atmosphere and closed with Nottingham Forest ending Huddersfield’s 18-game unbeaten run and claiming the prize of welcoming Liverpool here for a quarter-final. After Forest defeating Arsenal (1-0) and Leicester (4-1) in previous rounds, Liverpool are in for a fight before what will be a raucous crowd. For Steve Cooper, a former Liverpool youth team coach, and his side, the tie is just reward for emerging as worthy victors against an opponent who took the lead. Forest threatened Jamal Blackman’s goal first when a quick throw along their left led to a Sam Surridge shot. This was deflected and while James Garner’s corner yielded nothing the latter, on-loan from Manchester United, was to prove a class act. A swivelling turn that ended with the midfielder unloading at Blackman, who gathered, was his next contribution as Cooper’s men were a blur of attacking intent, dabbing the ball about impressively. Surridge, on full debut after signing in January, beat Blackman. It was ruled offside and though it appeared a legal strike, as there was no VAR in play, a second look was not possible. Middlesbrough v Chelsea Sat 19 March, 5.15pm (BBC One)Crystal Palace v Everton Sun 20, 12.30pm (ITV)Southampton v Manchester City Sun 20, 3pm (BBC One)Nottingham Forest v Liverpool Sun 20, 6pm (ITV) So far, all Forest. But Huddersfield scored via a cute corner routine. Taken from the right, it featured a phalanx of players grouping beyond the far post who acted as a decoy; when Danel Sinani hit the ball in, Tom Lees could rove into space at the near post, unmarked, and head home. Cue delirium from the travelling support, the strike a body blow Forest had to respond to. They did – supremely well. First, along their right, Garner and Djed Spence punched in balls that those in navy blue scrambled to repel. Corberán, formerly Marcelo Bielsa’s first-team coach at Leeds, has fashioned a high-pressing team and it had Forest penned in by their goal, having to move the ball around slickly to escape. They managed it and there was a smoothness in their excellent equaliser. The ball went upfield quickly, suddenly Ryan Yates was inside Huddersfield’s area and, when Naby Sarr tackled him, there was Surridge to rocket home for a goal that stood this time. It had the City Ground rocking, the wall of noise invigorating both sets of players. Huddersfield should have again pushed ahead when Carel Eiting blazed at Ethan Horvath’s goal but hit a post and when Duane Holmes tried to scoop in the rebound Forest’s keeper leaped from the turf to save. Breathlessly, the entertainment moved on via an instalment that saw Forest take the lead: Surridge claimed a free-kick along the left, Garner lifted it into the area and Yates rose to head beyond Blackman. It was an impressive comeback and when Graham Scott blew for half-time, the question was what might happen next. The referee could be glad of the breather: he had endured constant and hearty barracking, as when Brennan Johnson went down and Forest and their fans howled for a booking that was refused. Hold on for the next 45 minutes and Forest would take on Liverpool. They had a scare when Sorba Thomas raced in down the right and smacked the ball against the side-netting. The teams continued to hurtle at each other – a Forest move winning a free-kick that had Garner again standing over the dead ball from the left but, after dropping it into the Huddersfield area, no finish followed. Moments later Spence seemed about to test Blackman but Harry Toffolo, on as a replacement, made the vital challenge. Cooper, in the technical area, was a fidgeting image of nerves while Corberán was cooler, trusting his second-placed Championship team to create something A Sinani free-kick was one chance but Horvath was able to beat it away and Forest escaped. Danny Ward hit another dead ball around the wall but Horvath, diving right, again saved. Ward, also on as a substitute, next had Horvath flinging himself the other way for another fine stop. At the other end, heart rates quickened when Spence had a golden chance to kill Huddersfield off but, from close range, his attempt flew skywards. It was not costly as Forest ended in pell-mell mode, launching raids that stifled any threat of a late equaliser and extra-time.",Sport/Football,Ryan Yates downs Huddersfield as Nottingham Forest earn Liverpool tie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/nottingham-forest-huddersfield-town-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report
