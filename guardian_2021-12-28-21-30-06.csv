12/28/2021,"Chelsea could be forced to sign a left wing-back in January after deciding Ben Chilwell needs an operation on an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Chilwell has been out of action since sustaining a serious knee injury against Juventus last month, but Chelsea have been waiting to see if the problem heals naturally. Thomas Tuchel’s side have not been the same without the England defender and there were hopes that the 25-year-old would boost their title chances by making a swift recovery after he returned to light training earlier this month.  However Chilwell, whose rehabilitation was delayed after he tested positive for Covid-19 before Christmas, is unlikely to play again this season after it emerged that the injury requires surgery. The procedure is expected to take place this week and will leave Chelsea short of options. Chilwell’s absence is also a blow for England, who have Nations League games against Germany, Hungary and Italy in June. However the defender is expected to have recovered in time for next winter’s World Cup in Qatar. The more pressing concern is the impact his injury will have on his club side. Marcos Alonso is currently the only left-sided defender at Tuchel’s disposal, with Saúl Ñíguez, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Christian Pulisic unconvincing alternatives. Tuchel will be conscious of overplaying Alonso and could decide to enter the market for emergency cover. Chelsea could look at a loan move for Lucas Digne, who has fallen out of favour at Everton. They have also been credited with interest in Milan’s Theo Hernández, but he would be expensive and difficult to sign at this stage of the season. Another option would be to recall either Ian Maatsen or Emerson Palmieri from their loan spells. Maatsen, 19, has helped Coventry push for promotion from the Championship and Emerson, who is on loan at Lyon, started when Italy beat England in the Euro 2020 final. Chelsea, who are six points behind Manchester City at the top of the league, could be without N’Golo Kante and Thiago Silva when they host Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday evening. Kante had a recurrence of a knee injury during Chelsea’s win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day and Silva has a hamstring problem. Meanwhile, Tuchel is waiting to see if Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are ready to return after spells in isolation.",Sport/Football,Chelsea could sign left wing-back in January as cover for Ben Chilwell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/chelsea-ben-chilwell-cover-left-wing-back
12/28/2021,"Britney Spears has said the years she spent under conservatorship have left her scared of the entertainment industry. The singer revealed her reasons for not being ready to return to the music business after her conservatorship was terminated in November in an Instagram post.  In a lengthy note shared as screenshots, she said: “I wanted to be nice but what they did to my heart was unforgivable. I asked for 13 years to perform new songs and remixes of my old songs ... and every time I was told “no”. The controversial legal arrangement controlled her life for nearly 14 years and took away her right to make basic decisions about her finances, career and personal life. “It was a set up to make me fail,” she wrote. “So much wasted time to only embarrass me and humiliate me and I guess it seems odd to most now why I don’t even do my music any more. People have no idea the awful things that were done to me personally ... and what I’ve been through I am scared of people and the business. They really hurt me. “Not doing my music any more is a way of saying ‘fuck you’ in a sense when it actually benefits my family by ignoring my real work.” Spears shared the statement along with a set of graphics about praying. The final three images are the screenshots of her notes, in which she also talks about losing her faith. “I had an experience three years ago where I stopped believing in God,” she writes. “From every angle I was being hurt for no reason and my family was hurting me. I went into a state of shock and the way I coped was being in fake denial. It was too much to really face. It then came full circle and and my heart took over and I was [a] lion.” She also writes about her aims for 2022: “My goal for this year is to push myself a bit more and do things that scare me but not too much. I do know what makes me happy and brings me joy and I try to meditate on those places and thoughts that enable me to experience it.” Her post comes as lawyers acting for her father have called for her to continue paying his legal fees, claiming he had “stepped up” to protect her from “opportunistic and wholly self-interested parties”.",Arts/Music,Britney Spears reveals conservatorship has left her scared of music business,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/28/britney-spears-reveals-conservatorship-has-left-her-scared-of-music-business
12/28/2021,"The country has undergone massive cultural change around violence against women in the past year but the government is still failing completely to recognise the scale of the problem, according to Labour MP Jess Phillips. “I do feel like for the first time in my life violence against women and girls is definitely going to have to be a political priority and they cannot forget it,” she told the Guardian.  “But even with all the cultural change, the conversations, the money apparently being thrown at it, I’m still left despairing with women who’ve got nothing out the system and it’s just failed them again and again. “And are women safer now than they were at the start of the year? No, they’re not.” Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, has long campaigned on issues surrounding violence against women, and each year in parliament reads out the names of all the women who have been killed by men in the preceding 12 months. This year has marked a huge “shift change” in awareness of the issue, she said. “I used to wait for Karen Ingala Smith [from Counting Dead Women] to send me the names. But I see them all myself now; they’re being reported everywhere,” she said. “And finally it’s not just like: ‘Aren’t these individual cases bad?’ We have started as a public to see them in the round.” The murder of Sarah Everard by the police officer Wayne Couzens in March sparked a nationwide conversation around women’s safety that has been galvanised by further killings, including Sabina Nessa, who was found dead in a London park in September, and Gracie Spinks, who was killed by a stalker in June. Andrea Simon, head of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said efforts to further protect women in 2021 had not gone far enough. “It has been an unprecedented year in terms of how much we’re talking about violence against women and girls, which means that for many it feels like a watershed moment,” she said. “However, I think many of the solutions and the responses from government, and in the criminal justice system, have missed the mark. We haven’t gone as far as we should have done. And we haven’t moved as quickly in terms of making things better for women and girls who report abuse.” Phillips said that while the government has claimed to be taking action on the issue, “it’s not OK to focus this entirely on the criminal justice system”. “They’re still stuck in a furrow of ‘tough on crime’. I will respond to their ‘tough on crime’ by saying you’re not being tough on crime, you’re literally letting most rapists through.” To effectively tackle the problem there needed to be institutional change across a wide range of services, she said, particularly in housing and welfare. “In England there isn’t anywhere a single woman on an average wage could afford a private rental property. And we ask ourselves why women end up stuck,” she said. “But the government think that declaring new sentences is the answer.” The government is also failing to dedicate enough resources to prevention, she said. “There needs to be far more about education, far more about what behaviours are and aren’t acceptable, there needs to be far more robust interruption of the perpetrator, whereas currently the system relies on the interruption of the victim.” Reflecting back on the year, Phillips said she felt “a little bit beaten” after speaking out about so many distressing cases. “I have found it a really difficult year. You get to the point where each and every case that I see, I can’t believe that it’s still so bad, and it feels tiring. It feels tiring.” she said. “And I have suffered more because of the raised profile, and the threat level against me has gone up as a result of me speaking out about it.” In April, white supremacist Tony Eckersley was jailed for more than two years after sending hundreds of violent, misogynistic and racist messages to Phillips. She said the online harms bill currently making its way through parliament must be used as an opportunity to protect women online. “But currently it doesn’t say ‘women’ in it once. So there’s work to do,” she said. Phillips said she was hopeful for the future, with more opportunities to help tackle issues around violence against women than ever before, but she still despairs at how much “preventive work” women are expected to do themselves. “Women are the ones passing on the stories to their daughters about what you have to do. There’s a dreadful baton-passing about what to expect in life,” she said. “Women are the ones who have to act differently, have to behave differently, we’re supposed to flag down the buses. Women in relationships are meant to risk assess and then if you are a victim of violence, that is like a full-time job to come forward about it. “There is just so much where we are expected to fill the gaps left by a system that has failed.”",News/Society,"Government failing to tackle violence against women, says Jess Phillips",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/28/government-failing-violence-against-women-jess-phillips
12/28/2021,"One feature of online dating that makes it a recurring pub-discussion topic among my friends is the propensity for the people involved to do strange things. A whole new spectrum of dating behaviour has evolved on “the apps”. Habits that, while now common, are still odd things to do. Someone might seem very interested but then “ghost” or “orbit” (which means they stop replying to messages but still engage with your social media content, liking your posts and photos); or tell obvious but seemingly unnecessary lies; another person might read “the riot act” on a first date, sternly laying down their terms for how the relationship should progress; and there are endless stories about dates reacting bizarrely, even menacingly, if rejected.  One I heard recently was about a man my friend met on an app. When she told him she didn’t want to see him again he went through a phase of sending her pictures from her own social media accounts, platforms they had never interacted on, as if to say: “I’ve got my eye on you.” But most of it is not really threatening, just plain strange. I haven’t dated in a little while but (and there is no way to say this without sounding like I’m 90) I had my Tinder phase, and I remember the strangeness well. One man I matched with spent months sending me puns and jokes based on the TV show How Clean is Your House?. I did my own share of things which probably ended up being discussed in pubs. Once I was on a second date I didn’t really want to be on, with a man I didn’t like, and when he said something mildly obnoxious I latched on to it, picked a fight and then ran out of the restaurant and off down the street. When he messaged me later for an explanation I told him I’d done it because I was a feminist – as if that alone sufficed. But I knew, deep down, the real reason: I did it because I could get away with it. We didn’t know anyone in common. Who would he tell? I’ve come to see a lot of the bizarre behaviour through this prism. The apps have created a dating landscape that is largely divorced from our normal social ecosystem of friends and acquaintances – people whose opinions we care about, who might judge us for ghosting someone or consistently treating dates badly. There are rarely wider social consequences for anything we do when we date strangers we meet online, and so we are free to get up to all sorts. A new book, The New Laws of Love: Online Dating and the Privatization of Intimacy, by Marie Bergström, a sociologist and researcher who works at the National Institute of Demographic Studies in France, explores this premise. She argues convincingly that the growing popularity of online dating has increasingly removed it from the public sphere, turning it into an entirely “domestic and individual practice”. She terms this the “privatisation of intimacy”. The book has a refreshing lack of hysteria about the impact the internet has had on our sex lives, and no grandiose declarations about the state of love today. Bergström’s interviews with young people, who conduct almost their entire dating life online, illuminate a culture where dating is often so detached from their wider social network that the idea of mixing the two evokes panic. One of her interviewees, a 22-year-old, admits she won’t even match with people on apps whom she shares contacts with. “Even at the relationship level, I don’t know if it’s healthy to have so many friends in common,” she says. Another 22-year-old balks at the idea of treating a regular, non-dating social media website as a place where you might find a partner: “These are people you already know!” he exclaims. Others discuss their fear of being gossiped about if they go out with other students at their university. One 26-year-old man says he wouldn’t date someone he met at a party because they would likely be a friend, or a friend of a friend: “There’s always trouble and it creates a lot of problems.” The New Laws of Love casts doubt on the idea that the ease with which we can meet large numbers of potential partners online is heralding a new era of sexual liberation. Bergström is particularly insightful on the subject of female sexuality and the lingering, damaging influence of tropes about the “right” sort of woman – who has a low number of sexual partners, is not sexually direct and does her best to minimise risk in her sex life. Many of the women she interviews say they prefer to use apps for casual sex and relationships to avoid judgment from their peer group. As Bergström rightly points out, this demonstrates a modern adherence to, rather than a rejection of, expectations of female modesty. As she puts it, “it is discretion rather than sexual assertion” that makes these apps popular. Meanwhile, the men she interviews frequently reveal themselves to hold startlingly conservative views about female sexuality. One says that when an attractive woman on Tinder propositioned him for a one-night stand he was so taken aback that he started “hallucinating”. Bergström’s “privatization of intimacy” doesn’t seem to have made dating any better. I realised too, while reading, that there is a strange, uncomfortable public side to all of this not covered in the book. It is now common for people to share screenshots of messages from strangers on dating apps on social media for public disapproval. There are whole accounts dedicated to this. Sometimes the messages are unpleasant, abusive or laughably stupid. But fairly often they are inane. The other week a woman shared an entire conversation because a man asked her if she was “pumped” for a date they had planned, hoping for widespread condemnation. Maybe this also makes me sound 90, but I’d surely rather be gossiped about for sleeping with someone from my uni course.

12/28/2021,"Most years the very idea of a women’s Test team of the year would be redundant, but 2021 has bucked that trend: it’s the first calendar year since 2014 to feature two women’s Tests. India (having last played the format seven years ago) featured in both – against England at Bristol in June, and a pink-ball affair against Australia in Queensland in September/October. Both matches resulted in draws and, in a surprising turn of events, India matched their opponents: holding out in a nail-biter at Bristol, before racking up 377 for eight declared in their first innings against Australia. Australia’s coach, Matthew Mott, later admitted his opponents had “held all the aces” for the duration – a state of affairs reflected in the presence of only two Australians in the team that follows.  India’s excellence could be good news, however. Should the BCCI get on board, 2021 could represent the early days of a revival of the Test format for women. Fingers crossed. Hit the only Test century of the year in October, and the first by an Indian woman on Australian soil. The beneficiary of a bizarre decision by Australia to bowl first, she made hay with all her usual elegance – after hitting 78 against England at Bristol. It’s a format she was made to play. Defied critics who said she wasn’t suited to the longer format by hitting three half-centuries in her first four Test innings (two v England, and one v Australia), and sharing a record 167-run opening stand with Mandhana at Bristol. Holed out on 96 in her maiden Test appearance, but not before drawing first blood in her battle with Katherine Brunt, smashing 25 runs from 24 balls against an experienced seamer who had no answers. Hit a chanceless first-innings 95 and chose to enforce the follow-on at Bristol to take her side within a hairsbreadth of their first Test win on home soil since 2005. Selecting a team with only one specialist spinner proved to be a mistake but, after fighting her way back from a back injury, Knight’s part-time off-spin helped a bit, yielding first-innings figures of 11-8-7-2. Could not quite replicate her 2017 double-century heroics, but once again proved undismissable with scores of 68 not out and 1 not out. Now averages 87 in Test cricket, and you wouldn’t bet against her improving that at Canberra in January. Can anyone get her out? After years on the outskirts of the squad, Dunkley’s cap presentation was a special moment – not least because it made her the first Black woman to play Test cricket for England. “If it does inspire any boys or girls that’s amazing,” she said, before seizing the chance to nail down her spot with an unbeaten 74. Shared an unbroken stand of 104 with Sneh Rana at Bristol, to mastermind one of women’s cricket’s greatest escapes. India had been seven down and only 34 runs ahead, with a new ball due and a session and a half left to bat, but – subject to what they described as “constant sledging” – Rana (80*) and Bhatia (44*) simply put their heads down and got on with it, putting their side’s top order to shame. See above. An extraordinary performance from a player who was derided as a crazy selection, having not played an international since February 2016. Selected by India for her off-spin (picking up four wickets at Bristol), but has earned the role of all-rounder in this team. Headed into the Carrara Test sporting a scar from the ODI leg of the series, after being smashed in the face fielding a rogue ball. Got some measure of revenge by taking three wickets at an economy rate of just over two – impressive in a match that was dominated by the India batters. Threw everything at India in an attempt to bowl them out twice, including a mammoth, exhausting, 15-over spell on the final day. Finished with match figures of eight for 206, having bowled 64 overs in the Test (including 15 maidens). If everyone could have bowled like Ecclestone, England would have won. Some questioned the decision to play Vastrakar at Carrara ahead of the more experienced Shikha Pandey, but the seamer proved the doubters wrong when she finished with the leading haul in the match – four for 62, on a batter-friendly pitch. Had earlier enjoyed smashing Ecclestone for 12 runs off one over in a 21-ball cameo at Bristol. Peppered the usually self-assured Alyssa Healy with short balls at Carrara, and successfully saw her off cheaply in both innings – a key factor in India’s dominance. She may be 39 and these will almost certainly be the last two Tests of her career – but she’s still got it.",Sport/Sport,Women’s Test cricket team of the year: from Ecclestone to Verma,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/28/womens-test-cricket-team-of-the-year-from-ecclestone-to-verma
12/28/2021,"After five seasons of the groundbreaking TV drama Lost, the formula had started to get stale – to say nothing of the endlessly convoluted mystery at its heart. And so, for the sixth and final series, the producers added a new twist: as well as the flashbacks and flash-forwards that had come to define the show, it introduced the flash-sideways, showing the viewers an alternate reality where the no one was ever marooned on a deserted island. Anyway, as we come to the season finale of the Long 2020, with the reintroduction of a global villain viewers thought was defeated and an increasingly convoluted B-plot involving chaos in the top tiers of the British state, I thought I would borrow that concept.  Yes, rather than doing a look back over the year that was (because no one needs to dwell on that for a second longer than is necessary) or a prediction of what next year might hold for us (if I do not hold out hope for good things then I cannot be disappointed), I thought we could do something different, and look at what might have been if previous predictions had been a bit more accurate … Christmas 2016. The world was reeling from the election of Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg had just said it was “crazy“ to think that Facebook might have played a part, and I was predicting that the big story of 2017 would be … virtual reality. I thought that the recent release of Sony’s PlayStation VR, Oculus’s Gear VR and Google’s Daydream all pointed to an imminent mainstreaming of the technology – or, at least, a definitive answer as to whether or not VR had what it took to break out of the early adopter bubble. That means there’s two versions we could flash-sideways to: the one in which VR succeeded, or the one in which it flamed out in an industry-destroying mess. It’s fairly easy to see how the latter filters through to today. If 2017 had been the death knell for the VR industry – rather than another year of sales being just high enough to continue investment, but just low enough to claim success – then we wouldn’t be talking about the “metaverse” in anywhere near the same tenor. Facebook’s investment in Oculus would have been written off, Sony would have shuttered its VR project, and Google … well, Google did sunset Daydream, but that’s just because someone in Mountain View clearly gets off on killing products. But the former is harder to imagine. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s clear that the technology simply wasn’t sufficient for mainstream acceptance: even Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2, several generations improved from what it was selling five years ago, is still clunky enough that the company’s head of communications, Nick Clegg, blasts it as a “wretched headset” while wearing it for a PR stunt with the Financial Times. So a victory for VR in 2017 would have been still confined to a niche – but if that niche was “video games”, the industry today would be transformed. A breakout success for Sony’s PSVR, for instance, would at the very least have radically changed the company’s plans for the PlayStation 5, foregrounding plans for a successor to the VR system. But the biggest ramification, I think, would have been if Facebook’s Gear VR – a collaboration with Samsung that let users slot their Galaxy phone into the headset for low-cost accessibility – had been a hit. Mark Zuckerberg has wanted to build a VR-based social network since he acquired Oculus back in 2014, but the user numbers have never been big enough to fully commit to. Even the Meta rebrand was predicated on hope for the future, rather than success in the present. If Oculus had exploded in popularity five years ago, though, you can be sure that Facebook would be all-in on VR by now. The motivation remains the same in either world: a desire to own the platform on which Facebook is built, rather than have to play by the rules of, first, the open web and later the app stores of the major players. We’d be five years ahead on the transformation to “Meta” – but, of course, only if the events of 2018 had also been somewhat different from reality … As 2017 drew to a close, the “techlash” was beginning to brew: the events of the year had served to raise more questions than ever about whether the largest tech companies in the world were fit to hold the power they had amassed. Against that background, questions were being raised about one Silicon Valley company, which had an uncomfortably close relationship with the American right, was credibly linked to the rise of Donald Trump, and was being remarkably cavalier about the safety of children and young people on its platform. But it wasn’t Facebook. As we looked ahead to 2018, the smart money was on an annus horribilis for YouTube. The video sharing site’s widespread use by far-right shock jocks had been noted in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the phrase “algorithmic radicalisation” was on everyone’s lips: how far down the rabbit hole could YouTube’s recommendations take someone? “The world’s largest broadcaster has started to wake up to the fact that time and again, it is cited as part of the ‘radicalisation pathway’ that turns young men from bedroom shut-ins to mass murderers,” I wrote at the time, predicting that it would be forced to take action. On top of that, the same algorithmic pressure was leading to utterly bizarre content being screened for children on the site, with one internet theorist calling the site’s practices “infrastructural violence” against children. And then, in March that year, the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in the pages of the Observer, and YouTube was forgotten. The ramifications of that diversion have been long-lasting. Even as the techlash broadened from Facebook to the wider industry, with leaders like Tim Cook and Jack Dorsey invited to sit alongside Mark Zuckerberg and be shouted at by US legislators, YouTube has been forgotten. Susan Wojcicki, the company’s long-running chief executive, has never been grilled by Congress. Her boss, Sundar Pichai, has been; but YouTube rarely comes up in those conversations. Contrast that to, say, Instagram, which frequently gets treated like its own company in such discussions, even though the top down control of the latter is much stronger than the former. With or without the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was always going to face a reckoning given its involvement in the 2016 election. But YouTube has managed to remain largely unchanged over a period that’s seen all of Google’s peers forced to radically alter their ways of doing business.

That may be because I had a fairly dull selection (wow, past-me, you really thought you’d set the world alight with that prediction that USB-C would be in more things, huh?), and generally I’d rather be wrong but interesting that right and boring. But, being right still feels quite good. Still, there’s one major flub: I thought that Epic Games’ decision to launch a competing App Store on Android was a seriously consequential step, and one that could up-end the power of the app stores in general. I maintain my reasoning was sound. This was Fortnite at the peak of its popularity, suddenly being rendered unplayable on Android unless you installed Epic’s competing games store. It was a strategy that the company did indeed successfully pursue on computers, where it’s managed to bootstrap a competitor to Steam, the pre-eminent PC gaming platform, with just gumption, hard work, and billions of dollars in incentive payments to publishers for exclusivity. Epic’s problem, it turned out, was that while Google technically makes it possible to install a second App Store on Android platforms, it doesn’t make it easy. Add to that the fact that, anecdotally, Fortnite’s smartphone players are more likely to be on the younger end of its demographic, and so less likely to be able to pull off the complex steps required and less able to voice their displeasure at Google’s limitations, and Epic found it had argued itself into a corner. We all know what happened next, of course: reinstated to the Android App Store, Epic took the nuclear option, simultaneously breaking the rules of both Android and iOS in a bid to get itself thrown off the stores with standing for a lawsuit. But what would it look like if Epic’s stance on Android had worked? I think one possible answer is – not actually as good as Epic hopes. Alternative app stores for Android aren’t unheard of, after all, particularly in mainland China where Google’s own App Store is unavailable. Epic may have been able to avoid Google’s cut of in-app payments on Android, but it seems unlikely that it would be able to parley that into a wider competitive position. Instead, if the Chinese experience is instrumental, it would be more likely to open up a situation where every major app has its own unique App Store, and every minor app finds itself needing to be present on multiple app stores at once or run the risk of pirates stealing its customers. And then, of course, there’s the fact that Epic’s position on iOS wouldn’t have improved one bit from the painful showdown. In fact, it could conceivably be in a worse position that it is in our world – one where its case against Apple is weakened by the demonstrable fact that Apple’s claims that opening up the App Store would harm user privacy and security are true. Over Christmas 2019, I drew up a list of 20 trends that would define 2020. Twenty! Surely I covered everything that would happen in the coming – ah, right. Yes. In 2021 I didn’t even bother to make any predictions, and yet I still got it wrong, because the fact that I sit here today, in effective lockdown due to a coronavirus outbreak, is … not something I would have predicted this time last year. That said, I did get some things right, from the fact that workplace activism would come to Apple (aided by the pandemic, which pushed the secretive company on to remote working platforms and so enabled organising for the first time) to the continued failure of the UK government to pass the online harms bill (now known as the online safety bill, and barely closer to actual passage than it was two years ago). In fact, the pandemic probably helped tech futurists more than it harmed them. Its immediate effect on the industry was to accelerate trends that were already well on their way to fruition: if you predicted more people using videoconferencing, more people shopping online, or more people playing video games, well, the pandemic helped you out. My major stinker was predicting the death of Facebook’s Portal, the company’s video-enabled Echo competitor. “Who would want to put an always-on microphone connected directly to Menlo Park in their homes,” I wrote. “Portal sales have reportedly been minuscule. A second iteration was squeezed out earlier this year; don’t expect a third.” Well, it turns out that a dedicated video-chat device is rather more compelling now than it was two years ago, and Facebook’s big pivot helps position the Portal as a halfway house between full VR and simple text chat. Talking about the world of tech in the absence of Covid feels like an impossible task – what wouldn’t be different – but there’s one are that I think would be radically changed, and it’s not what you might think. Zoom, Slack and even QR codes were all slowly growing in importance, and while they may not have had the explosive growth that they did, the companies would be largely recognisable even if Covid had never left Wuhan. Instead, the most 2020 story that wouldn’t exist without Covid was, I think, the rise of the “meme stocks” and the subsequent NFT boom. The tale of the second half of that year was one of a “K-shaped” recovery, with some people rapidly readjusting to life under lockdown even as others lost their livelihoods for months. Particularly in the US, where generous universal stimulus payments put money in the pockets of millions who simultaneously saw their monthly outgoings collapse, it lead to the creation of a fairly large group who suddenly had an awful lot of cash to burn, and an awful lot of time to burn it. It’s no wonder, then, that Robinhood, the free stock-trading app that has faced criticism for “gamifying” day trading, saw a boom in use, as day traders piled in on stocks such as Hertz, AMC and, notoriously, GameStop. This year, the focus shifted from stock trading to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, but the underlying cause was, I think, the same: people with more money and time than they used to have, seeking an outlet for their boredom. The question for the coming year, of course, is whether Covid is required to maintain that interest, or if it’s now reached self-sustaining levels of attention. I’d bet (and, if I’m honest, hope for) the latter, but we won’t find out for a while yet.",News/Technology,Virtual reality check: looking back at our tech predictions of years past,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/28/techscape-tech-predictions-2021
12/28/2021,"MPs should be allowed to bring their babies with them to parliamentary debates, the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has said. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said that it should be up to the chair of the debate to decide whether the presence of a baby would cause any disruption.  The Labour MP Stella Creasy asked for clarification from Commons authorities after being reprimanded for having her infant son in a sling as she spoke in parliament last month, saying it had not been a problem on previous occasions. Commons rules state that MPs should not have children or infants with them in the chamber, but Creasy has taken both of her children into the chamber before without any complaints being made. Hoyle requested a review into whether the rules should be updated and reiterated his view that the “chair on the day has got to make a decision”. Referring to Creasy’s son, he said: “I saw that baby come into the chamber when I was in the chair. And did it affect the debate? No. Was it a quiet and peaceful baby? Absolutely. Did it disrupt? Not in the slightest. So did it matter to me? Absolutely not. “What I would say, and I’ll be quite honest with you, is each chair will make a decision. Unfortunately it’s become highly political. “It is now for others to decide, that’s why the committee is reviewing it. And I will then have to respect” its decision. He also said he had asked the cross-party procedure committee to examine the rules and whether changes were needed, and that he and his deputies could use their discretion in applying the existing measures. The issue sparked an outcry when Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, tweeted an email she had received from Commons authorities, which read: “We have been made aware that you were accompanied by your baby in Westminster Hall earlier today.” It referred to the latest edition of the Commons rulebook, which says MPs should not take their seats in the chamber with a child. The email from the private secretary to the chairman of ways and means, the formal title for the most senior deputy speaker, read: “I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this also applies to debates in Westminster Hall.” Creasy had been leading a debate about buy-now-pay-later consumer credit schemes in hall, a subsidiary chamber where MPs can raise issues of interest to them. Writing in the Guardian about the argument, the she said: “With little support from the authorities or indeed my own political party, I have worked as best I can while managing the needs of my now 13-week-old son. That’s why I was baffled to be told I could not take him into parliament with me. “It doesn’t have to be like this. Whether in New Zealand, Canada or in Europe, parliaments around the world have shown a family-friendly legislature is possible. “There are thousands of mothers out there who have something valuable to add to our politics, and they want to run. For now they see the mother of all parliaments discouraging mothers and rightly wonder if they will be welcome.”",News/Politics,"MPs should be able to bring babies to debates, Commons Speaker says",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/28/mps-should-be-able-to-bring-babies-to-debates-commons-speaker-says
12/28/2021,"Teleri Fielden is suddenly very despairing. After skirting around the topic for the best part of an hour at her farm in Snowdonia, we’re discussing rewilding and the idea of restoring land to a more natural state and creating more nature-friendly farming practices.Wales has become one of the focal points of the debate playing out all over the world about how farms and rewilding can work together. Supporters of rewilding say the two can co-exist, but that farming has to change given it is the biggest contributor to nature loss in the country.Around 1 in 6 species in the country are currently at risk of extinction and birds like turtle doves and corn buntings have already gone from Wales’ skies.With close to 90% of land in Wales used for agriculture, there is currently little space for wildlife to exist free from the influence of farming. Rewilding, which can involve encouraging and supporting wildlife on-farm through replanting hedgerows as well as giving over unproductive land to nature, could help reverse the biodiversity decline.A recent report from the Rewilding Britain charity found rewilding at 22 sites in England had led to an increase in jobs from a total of 151 to 222, in roles including animal husbandry, ecology and nature tourism.But two years ago plans to rewild a large area of mid-Wales sparked a backlash from farmers, who felt sidelined. Rewilding Britain was forced to step down from the project. Adding to the disquiet are reports of Welsh farmland being bought for carbon-offset projects.Fielden, 31, who has just taken over the tenancy of Hafod y Llyn Isaf, a farm a few miles from Wales’ highest mountain, Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), is involved in the nature friendly farming network, but nonetheless remains sceptical of rewilding. What is rewilding? Rewildingis a movement to restore natural ecological processes to largelandscapes – allowing wild land and its inhabitants to develop andchange independently of human influence. Popularly, it’s seen asbringing back big carnivores such as wolves, but in Europe there hasbeen more “herbivorous” rewilding, using beavers, hardy Konikhorses or wild grazers such as bison to change landscapes. The “re” isredundant: every rewilder accepts there can be no return toyesterday, even if we knew what that was. Why is it popular? Rewildingchimes with people because it is an exciting, ambitious alternativeto a century of conventional conservation. Traditional attempts toprotect small nature reserves with targeted “management” to helpspecific rare species has not halted the sixth great extinctionrupturing our planet. In Britain, the Guardian columnist George Monbiot helped popularise rewilding with his book Feral. Who are the main protagonists – and opponents? The termwas invented by the US conservationist and activist Dave Foreman, afounder of Earth First! The organisation Rewilding Europe was founded in 2011 andMonbiot led the foundation of Rewilding Britain. Mainstreamconservation groups such as the National Trust are wary ofrewilding while many farmers remain hostile. Critics argue that rewildingseeks to clear 4,000-year-old cultural landscapes of their toparchitect: human beings.   “I just find it bizarre. It is as if they just go, ‘we’ll pluck all you people out of there, we don’t want you, your livelihoods, your traditions or your land management skills’,” she says.“We’ll just remove you and to hell with the rural economy, people and food. It’s a weird kind of Highland clearance,” adds Fielden, referring to the forced removal of people from farms in the Scottish Highlands by landlords from the mid-18th century. Together with her husband, Ned, 29, Fielden is building a herd of sheep and cattle, which they rear outdoors all year round. She has made a beautifully hand-drawn map of their plans for creating flower-rich meadows and integrating the woodland on their farm, once an estuary.“Nature can do amazing things, but if we separate ourselves from the land, we will lose that link, as well as the skills and experience of managing it for ever. We could just import food – or instead, we could create livelihoods, local communities and homegrown protein.” For Fielden, taking on the farm was only possible with a loan from her parents to cover the cost of livestock and investments around the farm. Income streams include selling meat boxes, being paid to graze their livestock on other land, and jobs four days a week off the farm.It sounds precarious, but Fielden, who grew up in Wrexham, already feels committed to the area and community. “We’re probably going to be here for the rest of our lives,” she says.“I’ve always wanted to farm and to do something positive environmentally. And for me, beef and lamb is the most ethical way of raising meat. Our animals are very much free range, they’re just here on the land. It’s a closed-loop system [manure is recycled into the soil that grows the grass animals eat]. We’re not buying in soya feed like with chickens and there are no external inputs apart from worm treatment.”Jane Powell, a coordinator of the Wales Real Food and Farming Conference, and who has been involved in rewilding projects, says farmers are seen by some as “incidental” to the countryside: “That they [farmers] had trashed the wildlife and now someone else was going to restore it.” Powell says land-use debates must take account of food, wildlife, tourism and jobs. “Wildlife and food are not two things to be traded off against each other; they need to be integrated. “We shouldn’t be selling off bits of land for rewilding and keeping intensive poultry production on others,” she says. Rewilding Britain admits mistakes were made in the mid-Wales project, but insists it is a myth to think rewilding is about abandoning land, food production or communities.“Growing numbers of farms are showing how they can make a difference to nature – from smaller-scale wildlife projects that are sowing wildflowers or replanting hedgerows or reducing chemical use, to farms that are rewilding marginal and unproductive land on a large-scale,” says a spokesperson for the organisation. “Farmers are essential for helping society tackle the nature and climate crises – not least because some 70% of Britain is farmland, and because so often farmers know the land intimately, with deep cultural, historical and personal connections to it.” While Fielden juggles work, the farm and diversification to stay viable, 50 miles to the south in mid-Wales, Rhidian Glyn has a large enough cattle and sheep business to farm full-time. Glyn, 36, is also a tenant, with a landlord who he is keen to stress wants the land to remain in agricultural use.His type of farming – livestock on hilly land – is often seen as the least viable, yet subsidies make up just 10% of his turnover, thanks to booming lamb sales – “prices have gone through the roof since Brexit”, he says – and a profitable business rearing milking cows for local dairy farmers.Annual measurements of the farm’s soils show he is capturing and storing, or sequestering, carbon through his cattle and sheep. “Because we rotationally graze [moving animals between pastures], the organic matter of the soil is improving at a rate of 0.2% a year, which means more carbon locked up in the soils. For every tonne of meat we’re selling from the farm, nine tonnes of carbon are being sequestered,” he says. Yet for Glyn, this is no financial boom, rather a source of potential conflict if farmers are sold credits for that carbon but later asked to provide meat that can be marketed as sequestering carbon. As with the debate about rewilding, Glyn fears that carbon offsetting will accelerate a move away from food production and traditional livelihoods in Wales. He doesn’t want to sell carbon credits from planting trees or sequestered carbon in his soils if it replaces rearing sheep and cattle. “It would be interesting if the world did come to that, but whether it’s right is another thing. Agriculture is just the recycling of carbon, isn’t it? Whereas the companies that are buying carbon credits are just burning fossil fuels, aren’t they, which is just a one-way system.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.
