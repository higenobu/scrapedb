3/26/2022,"Two people have died after a large house fire in Nottingham in the early hours of Saturday morning, police and fire services have said. Emergency services were called to reports of a major fire at a terraced house in Whittier Road, in the Sneinton suburb of the city, at 12.43am. A man and a woman were pronounced dead at the scene but the formal identification process is yet to take place, according to a spokesperson for Nottingham police. They added that the property was “severely damaged by smoke and fire” and that adjoining properties were evacuated as fire crews worked to tackle the blaze. Officers and firefighters have launched a joint fire and police investigation to establish the cause of the fire. In a statement, Nottinghamshire police said: “If you have any information please call Nottinghamshire police on 101, quoting incident number 29 of March 26 2022.” Lisa Thomas, who has lived in Whittier Road for eight years, told the Nottingham Post: “It is frightening and really upsetting. I heard a lot of commotion and looked out my door and the house was engulfed in flames. “I think [the emergency services] were here until about 4am. It’s very sad.” Nottinghamshire fire and rescue service added that fire crews from London Road, Carlton, West Bridgford, Arnold and Stapleford tackled the fire.",News/UK news,Two people die in Nottingham house fire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/26/two-people-die-in-nottingham-house-fire-sneinton
3/26/2022,"The red carpet will be rolled out for the biggest night in Hollywood this weekend, as Belfast jostles for a prestigious accolade at the 94th Academy Awards. Kenneth Branagh’s semi-autobiographical film based on his childhood amid the troubles in Northern Ireland is vying for a slate of awards and tipped to win best screenplay. Belfast won Outstanding British Film at the Baftas this month. Ahead of the Oscars, the Guardian spoke to five people raised in Belfast who also left the city. They reflect on how leaving changed their lives, the difficulty of adapting away from home, and the impact of growing up amid the troubles on the people they became. Marcus Oliver, a 75-year-old retired journalist who left for England in 1964 aged 18. I didn’t meet a Catholic until I went to England at 18. I was the second eldest of five brothers, and we all went off in an orderly departure. It was normal to leave. From my parents there was definitely a sadness, but it was more of a resigned sadness. Things were getting rougher. You could hear the sound of these bombs going off, because of the echos from the hills amplifying it. I remember one night – this was when I came back to visit after leaving – being woken up by machine gun fire at a nearby factory. My father was a permanent secretary at Stormont and was on an IRA death list. We even had a visit from special branch, which told him: “Look, you need to have a revolver by your bedside.” He said: “No thanks.” My father was the last sort of person to handle a gun. Coming to England for agricultural college, people would say: “Come here, Irish.” They didn’t understand you were British. I went home two to three times a year. It was like being stuck in limbo, you tried to live in both places. Years later, on 9 February 1996, the IRA exploded a huge lorry bomb just under our building, in Canary Wharf. It was unbelievable, it just wrecked the building. I guess the troubles followed me. I went back to Belfast again in September 2021. The city is peaceful on the surface, but you can see the tensions are still there. Patricia Kavanagh, born on the same street as Kenneth Branagh in 1959, left Belfast for Spain in 1978 aged 19. I was born in 1959 at 168 Mountcollyer Street, the same street that birthed Kenneth Branagh in 1950. I was the third of four children to a Catholic family. On Sundays, we would play out in Alexandra Park after the mass. But I remember the swings being locked up. Protestant kids didn’t play on Sundays, they had Sunday school. Even as a child, I knew we weren’t really welcome. All my friends were Catholic. We had our windows broken. My dad patched them up but didn’t change the glass for maybe two months; he knew they’d just get broken again. We were targeted. All my teenage memories are of the troubles: British soldiers on the streets, being searched going into the city centre, lying in bed hearing the bullets. It wasn’t a pleasant time. I left Belfast in 1978 for Spain aged 19. There were no big tears, it was mostly excitement. I thought I was going on a big adventure. I got divorced in 1979 but have stayed in Spain, teaching English, and never lived in Belfast again. Every time I visit, I get this wonderful feeling. There’s a smell to Belfast, the smell of damp cut grass. When it rains here in Spain I think: “There’s that Belfast smell.” One trip about 10 or 15 years ago, I went back to see my old house. “Oh my god!” I said. They’d demolished it. Now, in its place stands a peace wall. Catherine Wells-Cole, a 74-year-old retired university lecturer who left Belfast for England in 1971 aged 24. I grew up as an only child in the suburbs of Belfast. I avoided the worst of it, but you were very aware of the searches and barricades in the city centre. I went to university in Dublin, then came to England for my MA; I didn’t think I’d be leaving for good. When I came to England, I was constantly being wrongfooted in conversation. In Belfast, there’s a very pungent, salty way of speaking. You’d use expressions that nobody would understand, like “you’re a queer gagquare geg” to mean you’re funny. You suddenly realised you couldn’t quite talk freely any more. For my parents, I’m sure there was relief when I left, that you wouldn’t be out one night in the pub drinking with your friends and there’d be a bomb. But I’m only beginning to realise 50 years later that the impact on them was massive. I’ve got an only daughter, she’s 35, and I live quite close to her. If she moved across the sea, I’d feel utterly bereft. It brings home what I deprived my parents of. David Turner, a 67-year-old GP who left Belfast in 1973 aged 18. I felt relatively free until I was about 14. A lot of my friends were Catholic, we played football together. Then there was this huge change: everything closed in around you very quickly. A Catholic chemist got shot – he didn’t die but the bullet grazed his forehead – a supermarket got blown up, there was a lot of ethnic cleansing. On Bloody Friday [21 July 1972], They shut off all the buses. I had no idea what was going on, so I started walking through the city centre. I walked past the sites of four or five bombs. One of them went off when I was about 200 yards away. I was 17. That was the first time I felt lucky. In school, we spent a week taping the windows like they did in the war. For university, I had Queen’s University in Belfast as my first choice, Edinburgh as my second. But my friend’s father, sort of like a second dad to me, took me aside and said: “You must get out, this is a great opportunity to change your life for the better.” So I went to Edinburgh in 1973. Life was just so normal there. You could go into a shop, walk about the streets. I’m happy with my decision and the freedom it gave me. Clare Stevens, a 65-year-old freelance writer and editor based in Wales, who left Belfast in 1975 aged 19. I lived in Finaghy, south Belfast, and you could see the hills from the kitchen window by the sink. You felt hemmed in. Even living in a leafy middle-class suburb, there was that nightly soundtrack of fire engines, gunfire, the rattling of bin lids. When I left in 1975, to go to university at St Andrews in Scotland, nobody could come with you beyond the airport car park. My sister and I left in quite quick succession. Suddenly the house was very quiet without us. When I came home for Christmas from Scotland, it was very strange to walk into the living room and see this large picture of me on top of the television. It felt as if I had died and it was a kind of a memorial. It hadn’t occurred to me until then that I was missed by my family. In Scotland, I tried to assimilate and pretend our upbringing was normal. I told myself it wasn’t that bad. It was only later I realised it was quite bad. I assimilated it in myself. I went to live in Belfast for a year in 2011, when I was looking after my mother before she died. It felt like a real privilege to have this glimpse back into what my life would have been, the place where my roots are. And since the Good Friday agreement, you didn’t hear bombs. You didn’t have to get your bags searched in shops any more.",News/UK news,‘The Troubles followed me’: Five people raised in Belfast reflect on the city they left,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/26/oscars-the-troubles-followed-me-five-people-raised-in-belfast-reflect-on-the-city-they-left
3/26/2022,"Born in Stamford, Lincolnshire in 1985, Nicola Roberts is the eldest of four children and the youngest member of Girls Aloud. Finding fame at 16 as a competitor in TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals, she and the group went on to score some of the biggest hits of the 00s, with 21 Top 10 singles and four No 1s. She later released an acclaimed solo album, 2011’s Cinderella’s Eyes, and has performed in London’s West End and written songs for other artists. Roberts supports the Recycle Your Electricals campaign. This was taken at our auntie and uncle’s wedding. Nicola and I were quite showy as kids; we liked the attention. But when it came to family events, we wanted to dress up then go home – do it all on our own terms. That’s why we look so done. Nicola and I were inseparable growing up. When our brothers arrived we were like mother hens – having to change nappies and feed them bottles. We’d be silly, too – at meal times we’d pretend we were in a restaurant and we’d host our own TV shows. While Nicola and I have never properly fallen out, we fought a lot as kids. Ball-of-rage fistfights. There would be props involved: pans, picture frames, plugs, Hoovers – hot water was a thing at one point. Nicola was vindictive with it. Once we had an argument, probably about something stupid like me moving her Pot Noodle, and instead of getting me right away, she bided her time. She said she’d wash my hair before bed and when it was time to do it she scalded me. I was 13 when she signed up for Popstars: The Rivals. We were just these little kids who lived in the northwest – and I didn’t really understand what was going on. Our family were at a holiday camp in Devon when Nicola had to go to the auditions. Every day Dad would come off the phone and say, “She got through!” and I’d be like, “Oh great”, not knowing what a big deal it was. We’d take trips to London, 14 of us in a minibus, watch her perform, then I’d be back home the next day, hanging out with my friends on the street. Although our local community got behind her – there were banners on roundabouts saying “Vote Nicola” – the older girls I’d run into were jealous of her and mean to me. There were pockets of real resentment. I tried to fight them and always knew how to stand up for myself, even though they were six years older. They weren’t going to do anything. Whenever Nicola and I would spend time together, we’d always do new fun things. She made her world feel normal for me, even though she was on TV. I loved going to photoshoots with her or shopping and thinking, “I’m going to get all these things that I don’t need!” Fame became just another version of our life together. That said, it’s hard having a sister in the public domain. I was so young when Nicola faced a lot of criticism in the press, the sort of things you should never say about somebody, especially not a teenage girl. Looking back, it’s really hard to know that someone you love, someone so beautiful, could have been seen in a negative way. Nicola and I were close then, but we are fiercely close now. She doesn’t even need to speak and I’ll know what she’s thinking or what she might need. It’s us against the world – but then it’s always been that way. We’re from quite a big family. My mum is one of six, my dad is one of four and they all had four or five kids each, so we were always at weddings, communions and christenings. This was before the time of straightening irons, so the night before we’d have put our hair in cotton rags. We’d wake up with ringlets, get dressed, go to the wedding and sit there bored while Mum took her 500th photograph of the day. Our family lived on a council estate in Runcorn called Halton Brook until I was about nine. It was a close-knit community and you very much stayed on your estate, with your local chip shop, church, Catholic school. I was a tomboy and used to go out with all the boys on the bikes. Then we moved to a house and I used to spend a lot of time in my room, feeling quite lonely. Frankie loved it, though. We used to have bunk beds, I’d be on the top and she’d be on the bottom, and we’d be able to speak to each other just using “mmm” sounds. In terms of our physical strength and cheekiness, we were a total match, so that’s why we fought so much. It was a nightmare for our parents. Mum would try to shout at us, and we would just laugh. Dad would come home and tell us off for laughing at Mum and we’d just laugh at him, too. We were little cows. Initially, I didn’t get into the final 10 of Popstars, so I came home. Then the producers asked me to speak on another ITV show and they told me I would be going into the house [to live with the rest of Girls Aloud] live on air. It was such a whirlwind that I had no time to prepare. I went to London one day and never came back. I was too naive to know what leaving home even meant. There were certain points in Girls Aloud where I was having a bad time with the media, and as a result I never had the opportunity to get swept away by it all – I was always grounded by everything else that was going on. Some of the other girls had the luxury of being so celebrated they could flourish in a way that was shaping them in the long-term. They seemed to have way more life skills than me, too. I had come from a small town, done my GCSEs and auditioned for the group, so the only conversations I’d ever had were with my school friends, my teachers and my family. I didn’t really know how to speak to people. One of the girls had to show me how to blow-dry my hair and they’d have to buy tampons and sanitary towels for me because I’d never bought them myself. It didn’t make a difference that I was the oldest of four back at home – that was a small pond and this was a massive ocean. I was very much winging it, so I was glad to have the girls look after me like sisters. It’s horrific to have lost Sarah [Harding]. Every day is still a shock and completely heartbreaking. These days, Frankie is a great soundboard. I feel as if I’m a bit more of a reach-for-the-moon type – intuitively and spiritually smart – whereas she is more logical and book smart. We fill each other’s gaps very well. Even now I still feel like her older sister. I don’t have children, I’m single, I love my friends – but Frankie is my responsibility, and that’s great.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Girls Aloud’s Nicola Roberts looks back: ‘We were little cows’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/26/girls-aloud-nicola-roberts-sister-we-were-little-cows
3/26/2022," The lost-youth mood of AE Housman’s collection of poems A Shropshire Lad (1896) has proved an irresistible source for composers – George Butterworth, John Ireland, Lennox Berkeley among many. Best known is Vaughan Williams’s cycle of six, On Wenlock Edge (1909) for tenor, piano and string quartet. It gives the title to On Wenlock Edge & Other Songs, Nicky Spence’s superb Vaughan Williams disc (Hyperion), also featuring Four Hymns, The House of Life and three folk songs. He has excellent partners in the pianist Julius Drake, viola player Timothy Ridout and the Piatti Quartet. The Scottish tenor’s gift for combining pure tone with direct, daring expression makes this a covetable disc (even with so many available versions out there, including John Mark Ainsley’s, also on Hyperion). In Is My Team Ploughing?, hushed strings pulsating, Spence handles the leaps from pianissimo to full voice with absolute control. Bredon Hill conjures the hot stillness of a summer’s day, piano tolling and pealing as “distant bells”, the high strings suddenly transforming all to icy winter and sorrow: magically done by all, as is the whole disc.  Brahms’s two string sextets, early works, are often performed by an existing quartet, plus two guests. This is the case in the Belcea Quartet’s exemplary new set (Alpha Classics), with Tabea Zimmermann (viola) and Jean-Guihen Queyras (cello). As a result we might think of these as works for a bumper string quartet: bigger sound, thicker textures. Call it an aural illusion if you like, but the moment you rethink it as three pairs – two violins, two viola, two cellos – the works take on new clarity and originality: in No 1, Op 18, the eerie second-movement variation in which violins and violas engage in a strange half-dance; in No 2, Op 36, the way the second viola at times hovers endlessly between two notes, acting not as padding but as vital pivot for those instruments above and below. Brahms struggled to create the sound he wanted, telling Clara Schumann that No 1 was rubbish, to be thrown away. Had he heard these terrific players, he might have thought differently.  Catch up with This Cultural Life (BBC Sounds), in which the mezzo-soprano opera star Joyce DiDonato talks to John Wilson about her Irish-Catholic upbringing in Kansas and explains how she longed to sing backing vocals for Billy Joel.",Arts/Music,Classical home listening: Nicky Spence’s On Wenlock Edge; the Belcea Quartet,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/26/classical-home-listening-nicky-spences-on-wenlock-edge-the-belcea-quartet
3/26/2022,"The Kremlin again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine as Russian forces struggled to hold a key city in the south of the country. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons while Vladimir Putin’s defence minster claimed nuclear “readiness” was a priority. The comments on Saturday prompted Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in an appearance by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world. “Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” Zelenskiy said. Putin established the nuclear threat at the start of the war, warning that western intervention would reap “consequences you have never seen”. Western officials have said the threats may be simply an attempt to divert attention from the failure of Putin’s forces to secure a swift occupation of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and to make advances in other key areas of the country. An adviser to Ukraine’s defence ministry, Markian Lubkivskyi, claimed on Saturday that Russia would soon lose control of the southern city of Kherson, the first major centre to fall to the Kremlin since the war began on 24 February. He said: “I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces. We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities.” Russia has approximately 6,000 nuclear warheads – the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. In an interview on Saturday, Medvedev said Russia’s nuclear doctrine did not require an enemy state to use such weapons first. He said: “We have a special document on nuclear deterrence. This document clearly indicates the grounds on which the Russian Federation is entitled to use nuclear weapons. There are a few of them, let me remind them to you: “Number one is the situation, when Russia is struck by a nuclear missile. The second case is any use of other nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies. “The third is an attack on a critical infrastructure that will have paralysed our nuclear deterrent forces. “And the fourth case is when an act of aggression is committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardised the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.” Medvedev added that there was a “determination to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our country, on its independence”. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, who had not been seen for 12 days before a brief appearance on Friday and an address to his generals on Saturday, also spoke about the nuclear threat contained within Russia’s arsenal. In a video, uploaded on social media by the Russian defence ministry, Shoigu said he had discussed issues related to the military budget and defence orders with the finance ministry. He said: “We continue ahead-of-schedule delivery of weaponry and equipment by means of credits. The priorities are long-range, high-precision weapons, aircraft equipment and maintenance of engagement readiness of strategic nuclear forces.”",News/World news,Russia reasserts right to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/russia-reasserts-right-to-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine-putin
