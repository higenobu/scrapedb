2/9/2022,"Majorities across Europe think Russia will invade Ukraine in 2022 and believe both Nato and the EU should stand by Kyiv, according to a study whose authors suggest the crisis could end up dramatically changing the way Europeans view their security. “The data suggests something of a geopolitical awakening in Europe,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), which carried out the polling in seven countries, accounting for two-thirds of the EU’s population.  “EU states have been portrayed as divided, weak and absent on Ukraine, but European citizens are united: they agree Vladimir Putin may pursue military action, and that Europe, together with its Nato partners, should ride to Ukraine’s aid.” The study’s authors said the survey showed there was “no longer much truth in the cliche that Europeans believe war is unthinkable and take peace for granted. They perceive their world as being in a prewar rather than postwar state.” The polling, carried out in late January, showed that majorities in six of the seven countries surveyed believed Russia would invade Ukraine during the course of 2022, with those nearest to Europe’s eastern border generally most convinced. Finland (44%) was a slight outlier, but elsewhere 51% of respondents in France and Italy, 52% in Germany, 55% in Sweden, 64% Romania and 73% of those in Poland said they thought a Russian invasion was likely this year. Majorities in all seven countries saw Nato and its 30 individual member states as the main defenders of Ukrainian sovereignty, but also clearly felt the EU bore a strong responsibility to come to Ukraine’s defence in the event of Russian aggression. In Finland, 56% of respondents felt the EU would be well positioned to come to Ukraine’s aid and 59% thought Nato would. Elsewhere, the figures were: 53% and 55% for France; 47% and 50% for Germany; 64% and 67% for Italy; 80% and 79% for Poland; 57% and 63% for Romania; and 61% and 64% for Sweden. Asked who they most trusted to protect EU citizens’ interests if Russia did invade Ukraine, at least half of those surveyed in each country – rising to more than 60% in Poland, Sweden, Italy, and Romania – said they trusted the EU. In two countries, Sweden and Finland, trust in the EU was even greater than in Nato. Trust in Washington as being equally committed to defending EU citizens’ interests was markedly lower, with more respondents in all countries bar Poland and Romania saying they trusted Germany more than the US. Even in Poland, Nato (75%) and the EU (67%) were seen as more reliable than the US. “While most Europeans still trust Nato to defend Europe, ‘Nato’ is no longer just another name for ‘the US’,” the authors said. “Europeans trust Nato to protect their interests more than they trust the US to do so.” The study also proves “Brexit means Brexit”, they said: despite London’s “much-publicised show of solidarity with Kyiv”, few saw a role for the UK. Only in Poland (66%) and Sweden (52%) did majorities feel Britain should come to Ukraine’s aid. The study also showed Europeans were prepared to accept significant, potentially long-term threats as a result of defending Ukraine, including the possible arrival of large numbers of refugees, higher energy costs, economic coercion, cyber-attacks and the threat of Russian military action. Respondents in Poland, Romania and Sweden were more likely to say that coming to Ukraine’s aid was “worth the risk” of all these possible consequences, with 53% of those surveyed in Poland in particular saying that supporting Ukraine was even worth the risk of possible military action aimed at their country. Perhaps critically, however, citizens in France and Germany were the least willing to bear any of these potential burdens – suggesting they believed the possible costs of doing so may outweigh the rewards, the report’s authors said. Majorities in all countries apart from Sweden (47%) said energy dependency was the biggest single challenge from Russia’s stance towards Ukraine, a view that was most pronounced in Poland (77%). Putin may be surprised to see that many Europeans “would see another Russian invasion of Ukraine as an attack on not just a neighbouring country, but on the European security order itself”, the authors concluded. “And it is striking that so many respondents – from north, south, east, and west – think this order should be protected.” With some clearly less willing to bear the cost than others, “the way Europeans deal with the next few weeks will be pivotal to the future of European security”, they said.",News/World news,"Most Europeans want to stand with Kyiv against Moscow, poll suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/most-europeans-want-to-stand-with-kyiv-against-moscow-poll-suggests
2/9/2022,"A former soldier scheduled to give evidence against SAS veteran Ben Roberts-Smith is seeking to pull out, prompting claims in court that Roberts-Smith’s barrister spoke to a senior lawyer who then contacted the secret witness. In a dramatic turn in the case on Wednesday morning, lawyers for the newspapers defending a defamation claim from Roberts-Smith told the federal court two critical witnesses had been contacted by lawyers, allegedly after Roberts-Smith’s barrister Arthur Moses SC contacted another senior barrister to express concerns the witnesses’ interests were not being properly protected. The witnesses – former soldiers known in court documents as Person 56 and Person 66 – had agreed to give evidence for Nine newspapers.  Person 56 has an application before the court to be excused from a subpoena to give evidence, citing medical grounds. Nicholas Owens SC, acting for Nine newspapers, on Wednesday said “through means unknown” the two SAS soldiers had been “placed in contact” with new lawyers after Moses contacted another Sydney lawyer. Owens told the court: “We have become aware that recently Mr Moses has made contact with Mr Phillip Boulten … and we understand that Mr Moses expressed to Mr Boulten concerns that the interests of Person 56 and also 66 may not be being properly protected in relation to [them] being subpoenaed to give evidence in these proceedings.” Owens raised the issue of how the witnesses’ identities became known to the new lawyers. He told the court “there is, of course, a prohibition on the true identity of Person 56 and Person 66 being made known to anyone” apart from authorised legal representatives. The new lawyers, Owens said, were not authorised representatives. “There was an agreement by Person 56 to both speak to us and not oppose any application by us to call him to give evidence in the proceedings,” Owens said. But he said after contact from those lawyers “Person 56’s position has changed”. Owens said the initial contact with the witnesses occurred “without the knowledge of … [the soldiers’] retained defence-approved lawyers”, who were only subsequently made aware of the contact. Owens told the court on Wednesday morning: “Mr Boulten and Mr Hodges are meeting with Person 66 today.” Lawyers for the newspapers sought, and were granted, leave to file subpoenas to two lawyers, Phillip Boulten SC and Peter Hodges, seeking documents relating to any contact with the soldier witnesses. Roberts-Smith has been issued with a notice to produce “evidence of communications between those groups of people and these two witnesses about their participation in the proceedings”. They are required to respond by Thursday afternoon. Neither Boulten nor Hodges responded to queries from the Guardian. It is not suggested they have engaged in any wrongdoing. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. According to the newspapers’ defence, Person 66 was an SAS soldier on Roberts-Smith’s patrol during an operation in Syachow in 2012. He had not killed a person in combat prior to the mission. The defence alleges that during the mission, two captive and unarmed Afghan men – referred to in court documents as “PUCs” (persons under control) – were taken out of the compound where they were being held and brought to a nearby field. There Roberts-Smith allegedly ordered Person 66 to shoot them: an order with which Person 66 complied. The bodies of the two men were then allegedly photographed with “throw-downs” – weapons and military paraphernalia placed on the bodies – to give the appearance the men were killed lawfully in combat. The defence claims Roberts-Smith later allegedly told other soldiers he had “blooded” the rookie soldier. He denies the allegation. The defence says Person 56 was a member of Roberts-Smith’s SAS patrol during a mission in the village of Darwan in Uruzgan province, on 11 September 2012. It is alleged that on that day Roberts-Smith took a handcuffed non-combatant, a farmer named Ali Jan, and forced him to kneel on the edge of a 10 metre cliff, before kicking him off. Ali Jan was then shot dead and his body dumped in a field, the newspapers say. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied the newspaper’s account of Ali Jan’s death, telling the court the man purported to be Ali Jan was a “spotter” – a forward scout who reports soldiers’ movements to insurgents – who was shot after being discovered hiding in a cornfield. He says the man was in possession of a radio and was a legitimate military target. In court, Roberts-Smith’s lawyers have previously opposed Person 56 being allowed to testify, suggesting the soldier had done a deal with the newspapers to only talk about specific issues. The newspapers deny any such deal but say they expect the witness to object if asked about matters other than Darwan. Soldier witnesses have consistently applied for, and been granted, certificates of immunity against self-incrimination during the trial. A still-serving SAS soldier, Person 14, currently being cross-examined, told the court he met with journalist Chris Masters in Canberra in 2018 and discussed his military service, including a 2009 operation on a compound called Whiskey 108, the site of one of the central allegations against Roberts-Smith. He also told the court he spoke with Masters and fellow journalist Nick McKenzie at a subsequent meeting in 2018. He told the court he does not recall any of their discussion in that meeting. Moses called in court for the journalists to produce any notes or recordings of those meetings. Person 14 was accused by Moses of fabricating evidence to the court that Roberts-Smith acted outside the laws of war during their deployments in Afghanistan. “You’re making this up aren’t you?” Moses said. “No,” the witness replied. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith’s barrister spoke to lawyer who then contacted Nine newspapers’ witnesses, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/ben-roberts-smiths-barrister-spoke-to-lawyer-who-then-contacted-nine-newspapers-witnesses-court-hears
