4/1/2022,"The UN-affiliated organisation that oversees deep-sea mining, a controversial new industry, has been accused of failings of transparency after an independent body responsible for reporting on negotiations was kicked out. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is meeting this week at its council headquarters in Kingston, Jamaica, to develop regulations for the fledgling industry. But it emerged this week that Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), a division of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), which has covered previous ISA negotiations, had not had its contract renewed. While the ISA negotiations are filmed live via webcam, the absence of ENB – which would have created a permanent independent record of proceedings – was described as a “huge loss” for stakeholders. Some states, including Germany, are also concerned that the ISA is developing its mining standards and guidelines behind closed doors, and that current knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems and the potential effects of mining on the marine environment are insufficient to allow it to go ahead. Scientists have warned that the damage to ecosystems from mining nickel, cobalt and other metals on the deep-seabed would be “irreversible” and “reckless”. One estimate suggests that 90% of the deep-sea species that researchers encounter are new to science. As opposition to deep-sea mining grows, the ISA is facing resistance over its rush to develop a roadmap to be adopted before 9 July 2023. The plan was prompted in June last year, when the island of Nauru informed the ISA of its intention to start mining the seabed in two years’ time, via a subsidiary of a Canadian firm, The Metals Company (TMC, until recently known as DeepGreen Metals). This invoked an obscure clause of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which said the ISA must finalise regulations within two years of such an announcement. Google, BMW, Volvo and Samsung SDI, a battery subsidiary of the electronics firm, have joined a World Wildlife Fund call for a moratorium on mining the deep sea, which will affect the potential market for deep-sea minerals used for car and smartphone batteries. The ISA said ENB’s contract was not renewed due to budget cuts. The IISD, meanwhile, said it was now fundraising to be able to cover the next round of negotiations in July. “Transparency of the talks are important, especially for small islands and developing countries who can’t always attend,” said the IISD’s Matthew TenBruggencate. Germany and environmentalists also expressed concern over a lack of transparency by the ISA’s legal and technical commission (LTC), a body charged with developing standards and guidelines for the mining code, which meets behind closed doors. The LTC comprises 30 members. A fifth of them work for contractors for deep-sea mining companies. In its opening remarks on the ISA’s website, Germany highlighted the absence of stakeholders’ comments, or marked-up changes in the LTC’s draft standards and guidelines document. “In order to be transparent and allow for a proper debate, a mark-up document as provided by the facilitator regarding the draft regulation would be very helpful for our negotiations,” it said. “Therefore, we suggest that the council request such a document.” Germany also said the mining code “still lacked binding and measurable normative requirements” for marine protection. It argued that, because the current standards, guidelines and regulations do not yet contain “specific environmental minimal requirements” for measurable pollution, sediment plumes, biodiversity, and noise and light impacts, the code as it stands would not regulate future mining effectively. “The current state of knowledge is, in our view, insufficient to proceed to exploiting mineral resources,” it said. It supported the EU’s formal position that marine minerals “cannot be exploited before the effects of deep-sea mining on the marine environment, biodiversity and human activities have been sufficiently researched, the risks are understood and technologies and operational practices are able to demonstrate that the environment is not seriously harmed, in line with the precautionary principle”. Other states, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Costa Rica and Chile, adopted similarly precautionary approaches, highlighting the gulf in scientific knowledge of the deep sea. On the other hand the UK, which is no longer part of the EU, has been pushing ahead for rapid development of regulations, according to observers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the UK government was engaging in ISA negotiations to ensure that high environmental standards were adopted in deep-sea mining regulations. “Any ongoing conversations in support of this should not be interpreted as support for deep-sea mining,” a spokesperson said. Duncan Currie, an international lawyer with the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, which is tracking the negotiations, said he was “very concerned” by the various failures of transparency. “There is no transparency of the LTC, who meet behind closed doors. It sounds like an innocuous body, but it is in essence the decision-making body within the ISA.” Currie wants to see a moratorium on deep-sea mining, akin to that set up by the Antarctic protocol. “The whole area of deep-sea mining is a political, scientific and political minefield. There should be a moratorium put in place.” Also missing from the proposed standards and guidelines was the possibility not to continue with mining. Greenpeace, an observer at the talks, called for reform of the ISA’s secretariat, which it accused of bias towards allowing mining to take place, to the detriment of the environment. “There are a herd of elephants in the room,” said Arlo Hemphill, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace USA. “There’s not enough time to get it right, and there is not the science to get it right.” The ISA secretariat was approached for comment but did not respond.",News/Environment,World’s seabed regulator accused of ‘reckless’ failings over deep-sea mining,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/worlds-seabed-regulator-accused-of-reckless-failings-over-deep-sea-mining
4/1/2022,"A $400m coalmine expansion that would result in almost half a billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions has been conditionally approved by New South Wales planning authorities. The NSW independent planning commission (IPC) has given final approval to Whitehaven’s expansion of its Narrabri underground coalmine in the state’s north-west. Environment groups and Namoi valley farmers said they were incensed by the decision which comes after public hearings were told by the Lock the Gate Alliance and opponents of the project in February the mine would become the dirtiest thermal coal project in Australia. The NSW Greens and an independent MP said the project would drive further climate catastrophe at a time when residents of the state were already experiencing extreme weather events with greater frequency, had lived through the state’s worst bushfires and were now in the grips of another flood disaster. “Climate change is costing Australians untold emotional and physical damage but this seems to have had no impact at all,” the Lock the Gate Alliance’s NSW coordinator, Georgina Woods, said. “It’s unfathomable.” “No perceived benefit from opening a new coalmine or expanding an existing one can possibly compare to the devastation the climate crisis is already wreaking on Australia.” The project will extend the mine’s life by 13 years to 2044 and increase the total coal mined from 170m to about 252m tonnes. The commission has imposed 152 conditions on the project, including requirements that it mitigate its emissions, monitor air quality and groundwater, and offset harm to threatened species habitat. In its statement of reasons, the commission said it found that Whitehaven’s project was not inconsistent with ecologically sustainable development and “would achieve an appropriate balance between relevant environmental, economic and social considerations”. The commission said it had taken into account the NSW government’s mining and emissions reduction policies and acknowledged the concerns of people opposed to the project, particularly due to the carbon pollution it would cause. The statement of reason’s shows the project is expected to result in 479.5m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over its life, 455.6m of which would be produced once the coal is exported and used, known as scope three emissions. The project would cause 31.19m tonnes of direct emissions (known as scope one). The commission wrote that the project was a gassy mine and “substantially increased fugitive methane emissions” were expected in years 12 to 19 of the development. But it said there were opportunities for Whitehaven to “deploy existing, emerging and future technologies” to improve its abatement of those emissions and to potentially benefit from “new revenue streams to the mining sector” by capturing those emissions. Whitehaven Coal’s managing director and chief executive Paul Flynn said the approval was a “great outcome for the company and the hundreds of employees working at the mine”. He said it was forecast to deliver $599m to the NSW economy and would result in the continuation of 500 jobs for an extra decade. “Big investments like Narrabri stage 3 are about lives and livelihoods,” Flynn said. The climate spokesperson for the NSW Greens, Cate Faehrmann, said it “beggars belief that as NSW is bearing the brunt of floods, the scale and frequency of which we’ve never experienced before, another massive coalmine gets approved in NSW”. Justin Field, an independent MLC, said the commission’s decision was “unfathomable given the catastrophic climate driven events of the last month”. He said the NSW Coalition government’s planning, mining and climate policies, made projects like this possible. “The fact new coal mining can be approved out to 2044 under existing policy makes a mockery of the government’s 50% by 2030 and net zero by 2050 climate targets.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Whitehaven was awarded its approval just one day after it received another fine for breaches of environmental conditions at one of its projects. On Thursday, the NSW land and environment court ordered Whitehaven to pay $158,750 for polluting a creek with styrofoam balls at its Maules Creek mine site. Late last year, the company was ordered to pay $200,000 for water theft at the same site. But the IPC cannot legally consider the previous actions of a proponent when weighing up an application. Boggabri farmer Sally Hunter described Thursday’s fine as “chicken feed” and the company had “now been rewarded with approvals for an entirely new and destructive expansion”. “This is a disgraceful decision by the IPC and will haunt our region and NSW for generations to come,” she said. Flynn said it was “no surprise” the majority of public submissions the commission received from the local area and wider Narrabri region supported the project. The commission received 552 submissions in support of the expansion and 1,205 objections. The majority of submissions that came from people in the Narrabri region were supportive of the project the commission said. “While today is a great result for Whitehaven, it’s fantastic for the Narrabri region too – last financial year Whitehaven spent nearly $50m with around 81 suppliers based in the Narrabri (local government area),” Flynn said. He acknowledged the approval was subject to conditions which related to carbon emissions. He said these aligned with the company’s plans to reduce the emissions at the mine site over time.",News/Australia news,‘Unfathomable’: Narrabri coalmine expansion gets final approval from NSW planning commission,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/unfathomable-narrabri-coalmine-expansion-gets-final-approval-from-nsw-planning-commission
4/1/2022,"The long and ostensibly triumphant career of Jimmy Savile doesn’t feel any less irreconcilably strange with the benefit of a decade’s hindsight. Savile was evil hiding in plain sight; a bad dream that most of the country didn’t wake up from until after his death. Nothing about Savile feels any more explicable after this series, although it does add plenty of worthwhile context – the grimy 70s, less evolved attitudes towards sexual abuse, the ability of public figures to keep secrets – that partially explain how Savile somehow maintained an empire that balanced fame, charity and child abuse for so many decades. It’s horrifying but a valuable piece of social history.Netflix, from Wednesday 6 April The sex line. What an odd phenomenon; once seemingly symbolic of the alienating effects of technology but now a quaint and almost innocent harbinger of the impersonal sexual revolution facilitated by the internet. This Dutch drama is set in 1987, at a time of growing freedom in Europe. Two brothers, Frank and Ramon Stigter, take advantage of that freedom to set up what they characterise as “a service to help men with their sex drive”. Their rise is seen through the eyes of Marly Salomon (Joy Delima), a student who performs on their premium rate lines.Netflix, from Friday 8 April The cheerful but deceptively acerbic comic returns with his second Netflix comedy special, filmed at the intimate Chinese Tuxedo bar in New York. His first set rejoiced in the provocative title Asian Comedian Destroys America! and this looks likely to be equally bracing. After all, plenty has happened in the last couple of years. With his trademark intelligent fury, Chieng dissects the pandemic, US race relations and so-called cancel culture. He also, inevitably, touches on the reception his previous polemic received.Netflix, from Tuesday 5 April Giraud is a big comedy name in her native Italy. Can her fiery yet self-deprecating standup translate to English-speaking audiences? She’s an amiable and confident presence – although clearly, she hasn’t always felt that way. In fact, exploring her teenage neuroses is a big part of her shtick. “A Picasso beauty”, as she describes herself. “I felt as strong and solid as an unauthorised structure built with the contributions of the Camorra.” Spoilt kids at holiday resorts and school discos also get an equally withering going-over during the special.Netflix, from Wednesday 6 April Yet another semi-experimental, semi-sadistic relationship show in which six couples – all featuring one member with commitment anxiety – are broken up and sent to live with someone else. Tonally, it’s an unholy mashup of Wife Swap and Love Is Blind (it is made by the production company behind LIB, too) and arguably takes an unseemly amount of delight in picking at the tiny faultlines in relationships for the purposes of entertainment. Doubtless there’ll eventually be some learning to go with the trauma. Hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey. PHNetflix, from Wednesday 6 April “I miss being a drunk. There was a lot less accountability.” Sam (Sofia Black-D’Elia) has bottomed out. She’s gone from a cool media job in New York to living with her parents. But giving up booze does tend to reduce life to its essence, and perhaps there’s a certain clarity in that. This search for meaning is the emotional centre of this unvarnished comedy – and although Sam’s circumstances are, to a troubling extent, neater, lighter and less traumatic than those of most real-life recovering addicts, the series still has a certain disconsolate charm.Disney+, from Wednesday 6 April Apple TV+ has been receiving justified plaudits for its adult drama offerings recently. But what about the kids? This DreamWorks animation, adapted from Kate Beaton’s book The Princess and the Pony, deals in the primary colours and simple moral clarity familiar to most children’s fiction. Its eight episodes explore the adventures of a young girl, Pinecone, and her loyal equine pal Pony.

4/1/2022,"There was a time when counting my calorie intake was as easy as breathing. Though practically innumerate in maths classes, I could quickly tot up the calories I’d resisted, succumbed to and burned in a day. If restaurants and cafes had revealed the calories in their dishes, it would have played straight into my 16-year-old determination to whittle away my already whippet-like body. For the 1.25 million men and women with eating disorders in the UK, eating out is about to become even more stressful than it already is. From today, cafes, restaurants and takeaways in England with more than 250 employees will have to display the calorie information of all food and drink they prepare for customers. This is part of the government’s wider strategy to help people who are overweight or obese, a category that includes almost two-thirds of adults in England and one in three children leaving primary school. In theory, this sounds like a simple solution: if customers who are watching their weight know a chicken katsu curry and a side of fried gyoza at Wagamama’s adds up to 1,224 calories, they might order differently. In practice, like most simple solutions, calorie labelling doesn’t really work. For proof of this, we need only look to the US, where calorie labels have been mandated on the menus of large chains since 2018. Despite this, Americans are still getting fatter. At best, studies suggest people quickly stopped noticing the small, joy-sapping number next to their favourite order. At worst – as it transpired in New York City, where such labels have been in place since 2008 – it seems they go for broke when presented with calorie counts, choosing dishes with more calories, not fewer. The failure of such policies can be accounted for in many ways, from the role a person’s genetics plays in weight gain to the addictive quality of high-calorie foods and the economic and social factors that make obesity a systemic rather than an individual problem. As Stuart Flint, an associate professor of the psychology of obesity at Leeds University and a director of Obesity UK, recently told the Observer: “Obesity is very complex. If it was as simple as eating less or more, people wouldn’t gain weight to the extent we have at the moment, and people would be able to lose weight more easily.” You would hope this policy would be founded on reliable evidence and the support of people like Flint. Yet rather than tackling obesity, the main effect of calorie labelling may simply be to induce anxiety and stress in already vulnerable people. It’s been years since I struggled with eating disorders, but only because, like any recovering addict, I’m meticulous about putting preventive measures in place. I have a therapist. I’m open about my experiences. I have friends and family I can look to if I’m struggling. I never weigh myself, or take waist measurements – and I never, ever count calories, focusing instead on flavour and nutrition. And I’m recovering – recovered, even, though the threat of regression continues to worry me, as it does all former sufferers. I can all too easily imagine how those coping with anorexia, bulimia or binge eating might feel when confronted with a calorie label at a restaurant with family or friends. When I was unwell, restaurants were a rare and special refuge; a place where, because I couldn’t easily count them, calories were off the table. The regret would kick in soon after, but for those few precious hours in Pizza Express Pinner or ASK Northwood, my weight worries were outweighed by the company, atmosphere and sense of occasion. It pains me to think that this brief, light relief will be taken away from people like me. The number of people with eating disorders in the UK is rising sharply as a result of the isolation and anxiety wrought by Covid-19. During long lockdowns, many former sufferers saw the disease they thought they had put to bed return. Mental illness can be easily triggered by changes in your environment: big changes, like a global pandemic, and seemingly small ones, like calorie labels on menus. While the new regulations permit restaurants to provide menus without calories “where the consumer expressly requests it”, the assumptions behind this concession are deeply flawed. It assumes the businesses will have such a menu; that staff will know to offer it; that a customer will know to ask for it; and that a pathologically compulsive counter of calories will ask for this special menu, in front of their family, colleagues or friends. It is a cruel irony that those who would ideally take note of calorie labels will eventually ignore them, while those who should ignore them will have to fight every instinct in order to do so. With this new policy, those of us who are at risk of being affected by calorie labelling on menus stand to lose an awful lot more than weight.

4/1/2022,"It’s been dubbed “bleak Friday” by some: pre-announced price rises for many household bills are to take effect on 1 April, adding to the misery for consumers who are already paying more for goods and food than this time last year. The price cap on energy bills for households in Great Britain has increased by 54%, meaning providers can charge up to £1,971 a year for customers with average use who have a direct debit set up. Average use is 3,100kWh of electricity and 12,000kWh of gas, so any household using more power will pay more. The cap varies around the country and according to how you pay. Those who settle their bills when they receive them will typically pay £130 a year more, while pre-payment customers with average use pay £47 more. The average annual council tax bill on a band D property in England goes up to £1,966. London boroughs are increasing band D bills by an average of 2.4%, while households in shire counties will see the largest rise, at an average of 3.7%. They will also see the highest bills, at an average of £2,041. Water bills in England and Wales will rise by an average of 1.7% to £419. Customers of South West Water face a rise of £12 to £515, while households with Wessex will see a £21 rise to £476. Other water companies including Hafren Dyfrdwy and Thames are reducing annual bills by similar sums. Telecoms and streaming companies have announced price hikes across their services. Some, including Virgin, have already applied increases this month. Customers of Sky, BT and Vodafone could all face higher bills from today. Sky’s Essential broadband package has gone up by 10% to £27.50 a month, while the Superfast service is up 9% to £30.50 a month. On average it says customers will pay less than 5%, or £3.60, more. BT’s prices went up on Thursday by 9.3%, which it said meant customers paying an average of £3.50 a month more. Some customers, including those with BT Basic or Home Essentials, will not see prices rise. Vodafone is hiking monthly mobile phone bills by up to 9.3%. If your plan started before 9 December 2020, it will go up by 8.2% to reflect the retail prices index (RPI) rate published in March 2022. A £40 plan will go up by £3.28. If your contract was taken out more recently, your monthly cost will go up by 9.3%. For a £40 plan, that means shelling out an extra £3.72. The annual cost of taxing your car is rising in line with RPI – typically the highest measure of inflation. VED is based on a range of factors including how old your car is, as well as its emissions and fuel type. Tax on a band E car is increasing from £155 a year to £165. The most polluting cars are subject to a £30 increase. A temporary VAT cut on hospitality has come to an end, and pubs and restaurants are among business that will pay 60% more in tax as a result. Some of the rise, from 12.5% to 20% VAT, is expected to filter through to prices charged. The night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester has forecast that over the next three months this and other price pressures will add 16-20p to the price of a pint, taking the UK average to £4.25. The government in England will no longer provide free LFTs to most households. Those who need them to visit relatives in care homes, or because they have been asked to take one before visiting a venue or service, will need to pay. Retailers including Tesco and Boots are charging £2 for individual tests, although cheaper options are advertised online. Housing associations have been allowed to raise rents and service charges in line with September’s consumer prices index (CPI) figure plus one percentage point, which comes to 4.1%. The Resolution Foundation thinktank says this works out at an average of £202 a year for the 4.5m households affected. The rents charged on shared ownership properties are often linked with the higher RPI, and many tenants are facing increases of more than 5%. Households in band A-D properties will get a council tax rebate this month – if you pay by direct debit, it could land in your account soon. This is part of the government’s plan to help towards rising costs, and is now tipped to be followed with a second rebate. If you qualify but do not pay by direct debit, you will need to apply – your council should contact you to tell you how. In more welcome news, pay is also rising. The government’s “national living wage” has gone up by 59p an hour to £9.50 for workers aged 23 and over. For those aged 21 to 22, the minimum will increase by 9.8% from £8.36 to £9.18.",News/Business,"Bleak Friday: UK prices are rising from 1 April, from energy bills to TV",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/bleak-friday-uk-prices-1-april-energy-bills-tv-beer
4/1/2022,"Reggae singer Eddy Grant may succeed where the attorney general of New York state and other powerful figures have struggled – by forcing Donald Trump to answer questions under oath in a legal proceeding. Grant sued the former president and his campaign over the use of the song Electric Avenue in an ad in 2020. In the ad, Grant’s song plays over an animation of Joe Biden traveling slowly in a handcar, after a Trump campaign train passes at high speed. Remarks from Biden are also heard. According to Grant’s lawsuit: “As of 1 September 2020, the video had been viewed more than 13.7m times; the tweet containing the video had been ‘liked’ more than 350,000 times, re-tweeted more than 139,000 times, and had received nearly 50,000 comments.” Grant claims copyright infringement and seeks $300,000 in damages. Trump has failed to have the suit dismissed. Lawyers for the former president have claimed fair use, saying the ad was satire, exempt from copyright law, and used footage reposted without knowing its origin. They have also said Trump cannot be sued because of “presidential absolute immunity”. Last September, Judge John Koeltl wrote: “Defendants have offered no justification for their extensive borrowing.” This week, in a letter to the judge reported by Business Insider, a lawyer for Grant said he wrote “with consent from defendants Donald J Trump and Donald J Trump for President, Inc … to request a 60-day extension for the parties to complete discovery”. Exchange of documents had been completed, the letter said, but “additional time is needed to schedule and take the depositions of both parties”. If the case is not settled and the new schedule is agreed, Trump and Grant will be deposed by 21 June. Elsewhere in New York, Letitia James, the state attorney general, is trying to compel Trump to sit for deposition in her civil investigation of his business practices. This week, James asked an appeals court to uphold a ruling requiring the former president to answer questions under oath. James, who also wants to force Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump to be deposed, has said she has uncovered evidence the Trump Organization may have misstated the value of assets on financial statements for more than a decade. Trump rose to prominence in the 1980s. So did Grant. Electric Avenue was a hit in 1983, reaching No2 in the UK and US. Discussing how he wrote it, Grant told the Guardian in 2018: “My big songs, like Electric Avenue, tend to come quickly. It’s like visiting the bathroom – you’ve really got to go.” As it happens, Electric Avenue is a political song. “I’d watched the Brixton riots unfold on television,” Grant said. “I’d seen the Notting Hill riots starting a few years previously. “I wrote down: ‘Now in the street there is violence,’ and the song just flowed from there. I had been talking to politicians and people at a high level about the lack of opportunity for black people.”",News/US news,Trump may face day in court thanks to lawsuit from reggae singer Eddy Grant,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/trump-lawsuit-eddy-grant-electric-avenue
4/1/2022,"For years, Oksana Baulina did her best to stand up to Vladimir Putin’s system in Russia, and was eventually forced to flee the country. Last week, she was killed by a Russian missile, soon after arriving in Kyiv to report on Vladimir Putin’s invasion. The death of Baulina, a former associate of opposition politician Alexei Navalny who was working for the Russian news outlet The Insider, has put the spotlight on the tiny group of independent Russian journalists now inside Ukraine. In their work, they are attempting to break through the Kremlin’s stranglehold on information about events in the country, which official Russian media insists on calling a “special operation” to liberate Ukraine from “Nazis”. Colleagues paid tribute to Baulina as a passionate and fierce reporter, who had given up a life working in glossy magazines to stand up for what she believed in. “I met her a few days before her death, I was probably the only person from her previous life that she met here, and she was explaining in great detail her plans, she was just so enthusiastic and really wanting to do the reporting,” said Peter Verzilov, an activist and journalist who is the publisher of news site Mediazona, in an interview in Lviv. Mediazona, like many Russian-language news outlets, was blocked by the Russian internet watchdog in the early days of the war for not adhering to wartime censorship rules that ban any information that could “discredit” Russia’s army. “Despite the block, during the last month our readership numbers went up almost twice, to about 3.5 million unique visitors this month,” said Verzilov. Nevertheless, Verzilov said it was clear that Russian state messaging was working on a large number of Russians, pointing to the numerous stories of Ukrainians contacting friends or relatives in Russia and being told they were imagining the things they could see with their own eyes. “When your own son is telling you, ‘Dad, do not believe the fucking television, it’s not true,’ and you say ‘No, no, Nazis are just brainwashing you,’ it does show that Russian propaganda is amazingly effective for certain portions of the population. It really does work, when you’re switching between channels and all of them have the same content,” said Verzilov. Other journalists agreed that cutting through the state-sponsored noise was getting ever harder. Last weekend, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an interview to several independent Russian outlets, and Russian authorities immediately announced any site that published it could face criminal responsibility. “The people who say, there’s plenty of information on the internet, they just don’t understand what they’re talking about. My twin sister asked me how to watch Zelenskiy, she just had no idea how to find it,” said Yevgenia Albats, a veteran Russian journalist who edits the New Times website. Albats said 741 websites have been shut down in Russia since the beginning of the war, and said the effect was hard to overstate. The New Times was blocked on the second day of the war. Albats is still updating the website using a VPN, though four of her employees have left the country. “Basically, it’s a total evaporation of any alternative news or opinions in the Russian language media sphere. Total destruction. Annihilation of any alternative views and opinions.” A singular exception has been the reporting filed from Ukraine by Elena Kostyuchenko, a resourceful and fearless reporter for Russia’s Novaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov won the Nobel prize last year. Kostyuchenko was initially turned away from the border when she tried to cross from Poland on the first day of the war, but was let in after the editorial board made some phone calls. Since then, she has been in southern Ukraine. She has filed moving reports from Mykolaiv, which has been under intense Russian attack, and Kherson, currently occupied by Russian troops. “Every day, I see the crimes my country is committing. Every day I see injured people, dead people, destroyed houses, I spoke in Kherson with people who lived through kidnappings,” she said, in a telephone interview from Mykolaiv. “It’s morally difficult, but I think it would have been morally more difficult to sit in Moscow and follow it on internet,” she said. Once inside Ukraine, Kostyuchenko said she did not have problems working with a Russian passport, once she had explained she was from Novaya Gazeta. “The majority of people understand why I’m here, support what I’m doing and support me hugely,” she said. Novaya Gazeta took the decision to follow Russian censorship laws, not using the word “war” or “occupation” but instead leaving blank spaces where the forbidden sections would go. Kostyuchenko said she wrote her texts without censorship and they were then redacted by editors in consultations with lawyers. “If the law was formulated to only put journalists in prison, inside the office we would publish everything, but the law is formulated so all the people associated with the text: proofreaders, internet managers and the accountants, could be responsible,” said Kostyuchenko. “We had a meeting inside the editorial board. We had two options: close or to continue working in the regime of military censorship. More than 90% of readers voted for us to keep on working,” she said. This did not save the publication, however, and earlier this week Muratov announced that Novaya would be closing until the end of the “special operation” in Ukraine. Many independent journalists have left Russia altogether, in fear of being jailed under the new laws. Albats said she had no plans to leave Moscow, but was “crying every day” over what had become of Russia, and the fact her country was waging a war of conquest. “We are destroying another country and killing people. And this is unbearable. I understand that what I’m doing is basically almost useless.

In the tourist season it draws crowds by the coach-load, soaking up the area’s fame as Constable Country and as a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. And while ties with Romanticism are unavoidable, Dedham has another fascinating connection with art: it was the birthplace of Cedric Morris’s East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing, established in 1937 for “artists outside of the system”. Notable students included Lucian Freud, Maggi Hambling and John Nash. This and more I learn from my guide, local resident, author and psychogeographer Justin Hopper, who made a walk through the pretty flatlands of Dedham Vale so much more than going to see the site of The Hay Wain. On his recommendation we begin our trail westwards, on a less-travelled path. We head out of the village with the church on our left. Just before the Assembly Rooms we turn right, passing some allotments. We soon reach the River Stour, and follow the Essex Way past a house to Milsoms restaurant, turn left along the driveway then right to cross the A12. We continue uphill on the Essex Way to reach Saint Mary’s Church, where Constable would often come to paint the views over Dedham. On the church door a fading hand-written sign reads: “Jerry the church cat has passed to wait at mouse holes in the sky. For twenty years he provided a meet and greet service at Saint Mary’s Church. All that was missing was a peaked cap with the label ‘security’.” Constable’s 1813 painting Dedham from Langham is a famous view, probably done from the tower of Langham church, which looks out over the valley and across to Dedham church. The Glebe Farm (1830), of which there are several versions, is the view of the next leg of the walk as we descend past Church Farm and bear sharp left along the Essex Way for a few hundred metres before taking a sharp right down a dirt road until the river comes into view. By a fingerpost we swing left, and where the path forks we hug the river, eyes alert for kingfishers, egrets, little grebes and wintering teal. From here the landscape is – and largely continues as – a verdant floodplain and farmland dotted with trees and copses, the meandering Stour thick with reeds and bullrushes. After crossing a concrete bridge overlooking a portage point, we turn right and with an imperceptible border crossing from Essex to Suffolk, we’re in Stratford St Mary. We go through a short underpass, whose 40-year-old U2 and Prince graffiti will soon surely be worthy of a preservation order. As we reach the river again and the vale spreads out before us, Justin points at a sky layered with bands of dark cloud and dotted with little fluffy ones. He tells me about Constable’s genius for depicting clouds and how John Nash’s Stour Valley, with its soft muted colours, makes for an interesting comparison. Another contrasting vision, he says, is offered by Lucien Freud, whose A Suffolk Spring Landscape with Welsh Mountains Beyond, painted at Morris’s art school, was recently discovered on the back of an old pub sign. We continue our walk, the river on our right, passing through a wooden kissing gate and take the Flatford Way diagonally up a hill to enjoy a rare elevated view of the vale below. We follow the road down, passing RSPB Flatford Wildlife Garden to reach a bridge. From here, walkers can continue to the locations of a large number of Constable’s most famous paintings, including The Hay Wain (1821), by following the lane around to Flatford Mill Field Studies centre and joining the inevitable throng before returning to cross the bridge. A furrowed pathway passes some extraordinary skeletal trees by the river. By a wooden gate, the path heads away from the river to reach a tree-lined avenue. We follow a final sign to Dedham. Approaching the Sun Inn, our arty walk concludes with an appreciation of the near side of the pub sign: it depicts Helios, painted by Tom Keating, one-time Dedham resident and the UK’s most famous art forger. Keating claimed to have forged over 2,000 paintings from Degas to Gainsborough. He was arrested on suspicion of fraud in 1977, but his work is now so collectible – originals sell for over £10,000 – that it’s not uncommon for new “finds” to be later discovered as forgeries of his forgeries. As Justin and I sit by the fire with our pints, he says: “For those who think of this walk solely as ‘Constable Country’, there’s a curious thing: part of the appeal of Constable’s paintings at the time was his romanticised depiction of rural life in an industrialised age; Constable was offering reassurance that the old ways were still there. “Two centuries on, part of the appeal of this landscape to us is its unchanging nature. But in reality this was a working landscape, utterly transformed in the 18th and 19th century by agriculture, mills and our use of rivers for transportation.” Justin adds that Dedham Vale became an AONB not because of anything dramatic in the scenery but because it has remained so similar to the landscape Constable portrayed. “We, too, have romanticised a working landscape into an ancient landscape. It’s good to remember this.” Knowing Justin as the author of Old Weird Albion, a book about strange goings on in Sussex, I ask, “So might perceiving Dedham Vale as Constable Country be Old Reassuring Albion?” “I think that’s a good way of putting it,” Justin smiles. “And it doesn’t stop it being a really lovely walk.” Start: The Sun Inn, DedhamDistance: 8 milesTime 3 hoursTotal ascent 50 metresDifficulty easy This article includes content provided by Google.

After taking it over in 2003, Baker converted an unloved 500-year-old coaching inn into a successful and popular gastro pub without losing the feel of a good old local. Oak-panelled with heavy beams and a bar made of polished elm, the inn is spacious, welcoming and offers plenty of places to sit and sup, including sofas and comfy chairs around the fire. There are newspapers and board games, and even bikes to borrow and boats to be hired. The dining area, too, is cosy, and peppered with colourful art; the beer garden is ample enough to accommodate the pub’s annual Americana music festival. The food here is seasonal modern English and Italian, the latter reflected in its considered choice of wines. There are pastas and “casuals”, such as seafood platters, plus a monthly changing menu (mains from £15) using meat from rare breed, free-range animals, fish from Mersea and local veg. The Sun has seven rooms, whose names connect to the pub, local history and folklore – including Constable and Boudicca. Next door to mine is Elsa, said to be haunted by its namesake, the last woman in Essex to be burned for supposed witchcraft. All rooms have nice big beds (up to super kingsize) and thoughtful touches like real coffee and fresh milk, a digital radio, a selection of books, rugs, dressing gowns and body lotions.Doubles £150 B&B, thesuninndedham.com",Lifestyle/Travel,"A great walk to a great pub: the Sun Inn, Dedham, Essex",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/01/pub-walk-the-sun-inn-dedham-essex-constable
4/1/2022,"New South Wales Health officials have added 331 deaths to the state’s Covid toll after a review of data by the registry births, deaths and marriages (RBDM). The deaths were added to the state’s total after NSW Health cross-checked death certificates, between January 2020 and March 2022, that listed Covid as a contributing factor or cause of death. The unreported deaths included 66 people who died from the virus at home, 131 in aged care facilities and 98 at public hospitals. There have now been 2,422 deaths from Covid in NSW, including two on Friday, a man in his 50s and a man in his 70s. Both had significant underlying health conditions. Of the unreported deaths, 270 occurred in 2022, 58 in 2021 and three in 2020. NSW Health said they received data on Covid deaths from a range of sources, with the new numbers coming from doctors previously identifying Covid as a contributing factor to the patient’s death. “Covid related deaths are notified to NSW Health from a range of sources, including public and private hospitals, aged care facilities, and the coroner.” “To ensure NSW Covid mortality data is as robust as possible, NSW Health has been cross-checking these deaths with all those identified in death certificates by the NSW registry of births deaths and marriages during this period.” The ministry added that they are usually automatically identified when a death from the virus occurs in public hospitals. In a report on the missing data, NSW Health say they were unsure why the details of the deaths were not immediately reported to them, saying one reason could be that unregistered RATs could have contributed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NSW Health were aware of positive test results from 256 of the 331 deaths, but had not received reports of those deaths. They did not have a record of a positive test results from the remaining 75. “It is known that some infections may have been identified by a rapid antigen test that was not registered with Service NSW and some may have had a diagnosis based on testing performed outside NSW, or based on a clinical diagnosis without a laboratory test.” “In some cases, it is possible the facilities may have assumed the death was already reported by another authority. Some deaths were associated with other significant conditions such as end-stage cancer or significant neurological conditions.” They said that in a situation where an “expected” death happened at home, such as with an elderly person with significant underlying health conditions, the doctor may have only reported the death through the RBDM. “As many of the deaths occurred recently, and there is sometimes a delay between a death occurring and it being reported to NSW Health, it is possible that NSW Health would have received a report of the death through the usual channels, but at a later date.” The distribution of the deaths by age, gender and local health district largely reflected the Covid deaths already reported, with 30% coming from South Western Sydney Local Health District. NSW recorded 25, 495 new cases on Friday, with 1,345 admitted to hospital and 43 in intensive care. It comes as Queensland has moved to suspend surgeries in some hospitals, as they recorded three deaths and 10,722 new cases, with 14 people in intensive care. Health Minister, Yvette D’Ath, announced the suspension, saying the mounting number of health workers needing to quarantine or isolate was taking its toll. More than 3,300 health workers were currently furloughed, a figure that had more than doubled in the past week and a half. Data on the latest Omicron wave sweeping Queensland showed the state was approaching the peak of transmission, with hospital numbers expected to increase in the coming weeks. Victoria recorded 10,424 new cases and six deaths, Western Australia reported 8,731 new cases and two deaths, while the Australian Capital Territory reported 1,014 new cases and one death overnight.",News/Australia news,NSW adds 331 deaths to Covid toll after data review,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/nsw-adds-331-deaths-to-covid-toll-after-data-review
4/1/2022,"Alan Tudge could receive a pay boost of $31,000 for remaining the education minister for an extra two and a half months despite claiming he would not return to the frontbench in March. At Senate estimates on Friday, government officials confirmed that Tudge remains education minister and is “on leave” despite the acting minister, Stuart Robert, performing the functions of the role. Tudge stood aside on 2 December pending an investigation into allegations made by his former media adviser, Rachelle Miller, about her relationship with him in 2017. Tudge has denied the allegations. On 4 March the government released the report of former bureaucrat Vivienne Thom, finding there was insufficient evidence Tudge had breached the ministerial standards. But Tudge nevertheless said he had “requested not to be returned to the front bench before the election”. Scott Morrison said in the “interests of his family and his own wellbeing and in order to focus on his re-election as the member for Aston [Tudge] is not seeking to return to the front bench, and I support his decision”. On Friday, the government services minister, Linda Reynolds, told Senate estimates Tudge is “on leave” but “he still is” the education minister. Asked if Tudge is still receiving ministerial pay, Reynolds directed the question to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet but confirmed that he remained as minister. Michele Bruniges, the education department secretary, said the latest ministerial list is dated 8 October, subject to the March announcement of Robert as acting minister. The October list states Tudge is education minister, and in cabinet. Officials referred questions about whether Tudge remains in cabinet to PMC. Reynolds said the employment minister, Stuart Robert, was now acting education minister, and Tudge’s staff continued in their roles to support Robert, not Tudge, to perform the role’s functions. Reynolds said it was “entirely standard” and “not unusual” that Robert performs the functions of education minister as acting minister, and Tudge’s ministerial office remains in place. Cabinet ministers receive $357,000 per year, about $150,000 more than the backbench MP salary of $207,000. If Tudge is continuing to be paid at ministerial rates, as the answers imply, he will receive a pay boost of at least $67,000 for remaining a minister between when he stood aside in December and the election in mid-May, or $31,000 from early March to mid-May. Labor’s shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said “despite saying a month ago that he had quit the cabinet, government officials have revealed Alan Tudge is still the education minister, his taxpayer funded office is still operating, and wouldn’t answer whether he’s still getting a cabinet minister’s salary”. Plibersek said it “looks like” Morrison is “happy to pay his mates a fortune for doing nothing”. In March Robert ruffled feathers by claiming that independent schools do not accept “dud teachers”, sending the “bottom 10% of teachers dragging the chain” into the government system, where they are protected from being fired. On Friday, Robert announced that he and state and territory education ministers had agreed on a new Australian curriculum after changes to “declutter” it. Robert praised changes including embedding phonics education in English, and making history compulsory in years 9 and 10.

4/1/2022,"Hello, it’s Friday morning and you’ll have to make do with me, Warren Murray. Peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv are expected to resume by video today amid fresh efforts to get civilians out of Mariupol, where a corridor for aid and evacuations is supposed to open this morning. The Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said talks would focus on a peace framework Kyiv presented in Istanbul this week. Vladimir Putin has meanwhile tried to up the diplomatic stakes with a decree requiring foreign buyers to pay in roubles for Russian gas – a demand Germany, France and the UK have rejected. In reality, the money will just be exchanged into roubles by the Russian central bank once payments are received. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that Russia is preparing for “powerful strikes” in the Donbas region. He dismissed the withdrawal of Russian forces near Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy as tactical, which was backed by Pentagon assessments. The UK’s ministry of defence said Russia was pulling forces out of Georgia to reinforce its invasion of Ukraine, “indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion”. There is mounting western scepticism about Russia’s intentions in peace talks, with no real sign of the partial military pullback in northern Ukraine it had promised as a goodwill gesture. The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving high doses of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it could not confirm the claims by Ukrainian state power company Energoatom and was seeking an independent assessment. Australia is to send Bushmaster armoured vehicles to Ukraine following an address to MPs by Zelenskiy. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions. Coverage of the war in Ukraine continues at our live blog. ‘Conversion’ practices debacle – Boris Johnson appeared to beat a hasty retreat last night after revelations that ministers would not outlaw “conversion” practices. “Conversion” attempts to change or suppress a person’s sexuality or gender identity; Johnson and his predecessor, Theresa May, promised to make it illegal. But an ITV report based on a Downing Street briefing paper said the government would drop new legislation and try to use existing laws instead. Uproar followed the ITV report, after which the journalist Paul Brand, who broke the story, quoted a senior government source as saying legislation would in fact be brought forward. In a move unlikely to end the controversy, Brand reported the legislation would cover “only gay conversion therapy, not trans”. It comes as young LGBTQ+ people in the UK face a “hidden epidemic” of humiliation, ostracism and public outing by close family members, according to a study. Pancreas that you wear – Hundreds of adults and children with type 1 diabetes in England have been fitted with an artificial pancreas in a world-first trial on the NHS. The device worn next to the body monitors blood glucose levels and automatically adjusts insulin delivery via a pump. The technology can eliminate finger-prick tests to check blood sugar levels and prevent hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemia attacks. Children are particularly at risk of dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) and high ones (hyperglycaemia), which can damage the body or even lead to death. Although most of the NHS’s estimated £10bn annual spending on diabetes treatment goes on type 2 diabetes, it is also hoped the devices will help cut costs by ensuring less need for interventions for type 1 cases. Iran tank debt inquiry – MPs are to examine why ministers delayed paying a £400m debt to Iran even though they knew the payment was likely to lead to the release of British-Iranian detainees. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were freed a fortnight ago and returned to the UK. The debt had been an upfront payment in 1971 to the UK by the Iranian government under the Shah of Iran for more than 1,700 Chieftain tanks. Only 175 were delivered due to the overthrow of the Shah in 1979. Even if you’ve had it – Covid-19 vaccines provide significant extra protection for people who have already been infected, especially against severe disease, according to two new studies that address one of the outstanding questions from the pandemic. The first study, conducted in Brazil, found that four vaccines – CoronaVac, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Janssen and Pfizer/BioNTech – provide extra protection against symptomatic reinfection and severe outcomes such as hospitalisation and death in people who had previously caught coronavirus. The second study, from Sweden, found that vaccination against Covid-19 provided additional protection to those who had had Covid before, for at least nine months.

4/1/2022,"A 19-month-old child has died in Gaza after waiting for five months for Israel to grant her permission to leave the blockaded enclave for treatment. Human right groups said Israel’s blockade of Gaza was responsible for the death of Fatima al-Masri, who was diagnosed last year with a hole in the heart and who died on Friday. “I loved her from deep inside my heart. I wish I had died as well as her,” said Jalal al-Masri, Fatima’s father. “They kept saying the application was ‘under review, under review’ and then she died. “It felt like I had died as well without Fatima in my life. Nothing breaks a person more than losing their child.” Masri said that Fatima missed two appointments for treatment at Jerusalem’s al-Makassed hospital in December and February while her family were told her case was “under review” by the Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA), the Israeli authority which handles Palestinian travel permits. “We are under blockade. I don’t understand how Israel can send me this message about her case being under review. If Israel wanted to send her by herself for treatment, then send her,” said Masri. The Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, a Palestinian NGO, took on Fatima’s case when Masri complained in February, urging Israel to issue the permit in time for her to be taken to al-Makassed in the week after the appointment, before the hospital takes a patient off its list. “Al Mezan deeply regrets Fatima’s death and strongly condemns Israel’s ongoing closure on the Gaza Strip and its associated restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, that includes denying patients access to the hospitals in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Israel and abroad,” the NGO said in a statement. Al Mezan said the Israeli authority, which makes decisions on permits, referred them instead to the Palestinian Civil Affairs Committee (PCAC), which co-ordinates with Israel. Israel approved 69% of permit applications from patients in Gaza in February but 56% of applications for companions to patients were not responded to in time for the appointment, according to the World Health Organization’s monthly report. Miriam Marmur, a director for Israeli group Gisha, which campaigns for Palestinian freedom of movement, said Israel appears to have changed how it deals with permits, no longer handling applications from human rights groups or lawyers but directing them through the PCAC. “Unfortunately, non-response to permit applications is a practice of bureaucratic violence used by Israel on a regular basis,” said Marmur. “In a growing number of cases, even patently humanitarian and highly urgent ones such as Fatima al-Masri’s, people receive no response from the CLA, effectively blocking them from accessing medical treatment, as well as other needs. We know of multiple cases where people are not receiving answers to their applications for urgent treatment outside of Gaza.” Palestinians have to travel for serious conditions that the overburdened health system in Gaza cannot treat, but face long waits for permits to both Israel and Egypt, where they also endure a difficult journey through the Sinai desert. The UN’s special rapporteur for Palestine, Michael Lynk, in a report last week that described Israel’s control over Palestinian territories as “apartheid”, said Gaza’s health system “is flat on its back, with serious shortages of healthcare professionals, inadequate treatment equipment and low supplies of drugs and medicines.” Mahmoud Shalabi, programme manager in Gaza for the charity Medical Aid Palestine, said the blockade had “suffocated” the health system, leaving hospitals short of medicine and equipment, and that conditions had worsened during the pandemic. “My cousin, who was suffering from cancer, tried to seek specialist care in East Jerusalem, but died while waiting for a permit. She left behind five young children,” said Shalabi. “Accessing care feels like a lottery. The case of 19-month-old Fatima is another devastating story. But these stories will keep appearing while Israel’s blockade and restrictions are in place.” The Israeli military authority over the Palestinian authorities, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.",News/World news,Palestinian baby dies after treatment delayed by Israeli blockade of Gaza,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/palestinian-baby-dies-after-treatment-delayed-by-israeli-blockade-of-gaza
