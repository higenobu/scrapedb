1/26/2022,"Microsoft reported a profit of $18.8bn for the last three months of 2021, ahead of analysts expectations, but its share price initially slumped over 5% after another rocky day on Wall Street. The Seattle-based software giant reported revenues of $51.7bn, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year and ahead of expectations. But the news was not enough to impress investors who appear to have soured on the tech sector after a historic boom in share prices during the pandemic.  Microsoft is the first of the biggest US tech companies to report quarterly earnings with Apple, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet to come. The reports are being closely watched after Netflix’s share price collapsed following the release of disappointing subscriber numbers. Since Netflix’s fall, stock markets have gyrated wildly. Investors are concerned about the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Microsoft’s cloud computing business benefitted from the shift online during the pandemic as Covid-19 closed down offices across the world. Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft, said he expected the trend to continue. “Digital technology is the most malleable resource at the world’s disposal to overcome constraints and reimagine everyday work and life,” said Nadella. “As tech as a percentage of global GDP continues to increase, we are innovating and investing across diverse and growing markets, with a common underlying technology stack and an operating model that reinforces a common strategy, culture and sense of purpose.”",News/Technology,Microsoft beats expectations with $18.8bn profit,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/25/microsoft-quarterly-earnings-revenue-tech
1/26/2022,"The new owner of Scott Morrison’s WeChat account has expressed disbelief that it had been entrusted to an individual in China – and is now considering shutting it down amid a growing political storm. Earlier this month, subscribers to the Australian prime minister’s official WeChat profile were notified the account had been sold to the Fuzhou 985 Information Technology Co Ltd and had been renamed “Australian Chinese New Life”.  The account’s new owners have not yet posted any content, despite claims by a News Corp tabloid that it had been “rebranded as a pro-Beijing propaganda outfit”. Some members of Morrison’s Liberal party are now calling on Australian politicians to boycott WeChat, citing concerns about potential foreign interference. The platform has been used by both major Australian political parties to connect with the Chinese-Australian community. Huang Aipeng, the legal representative for the Fuzhou software development firm, told Guardian Australia he only learned on Monday that the account belonged to Morrison. “When I was first told that this account belonged to Morrison, I didn’t believe it at all,” he said on Tuesday. “How could a big head of state have handed over his WeChat account to a single person to manage?” Huang categorically denied any allegations of foreign interference. “I’ve had absolutely no contact over here with any kind of government-related body,” he said. Huang said he bought the account for his company as a formal business transaction in keeping with Wechat’s platform migration rules. He bought it directly from an acquaintance with the surname Ji, who could not be contacted. Huang said he had bought the account because it had a high number of followers, and had intended to provide Chinese-Australians with “practical lifestyle information”. Huang would not disclose how much he paid for the account, but said the transfer was finalised in January. There have been no posts on Morrison’s former account since 9 July, when the prime minister responded to the NSW lockdown announcement by promoting the $500 Covid disaster payment. Fuzhou 985 Information Technology Co Ltd was founded in 2015. A listed website with a similar name, which describes itself as an “authoritative betting platform” for live sports and gaming, was not associated with the firm, Huang said. “I never imagined this account would have anything to do with the Australian government,” he said. “Now that I understand the situation, I might shut down the account.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian defence minister, Peter Dutton, directly accused the Chinese government of involvement in the takeover of Morrison’s account. “The fact that a leader of a democratic country can’t have an uninterrupted presence on a major media platform, social media platform, I think says a lot about the approach of the Chinese government and it’s unacceptable,” Dutton said on Tuesday. Dutton said Australia wanted a “peaceful, pleasant relationship” with the Chinese government, but added: “I’m not going to ignore the attributes of the Communist regime, which is involved in dissemination of disinformation and ultimately, in this case, interfering with the prime minister’s WeChat account.” The comments came a day after a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said: “The accusation of China interference is nothing but unfounded denigration and smear.” WeChat’s owner, the Chinese tech giant Tencent, said there was “no evidence of any hacking or third-party intrusion” of Morrison’s account, and it “appears to be a dispute over account ownership”. “The account in question was originally registered by a PRC [People’s Republic of China] individual and was subsequently transferred to its current operator, a technology services company – and it will be handled in accordance with our platform rules,” Tencent said. Analysts say “subscription accounts” on WeChat require registration by a Chinese national. An alternative option is a “service account”, which does not require a Chinese national third-party to register, but it may be less attractive to politicians because it allows fewer “push-notification-enabled articles”, according to Fergus Ryan, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Ryan on Tuesday cited records indicating the WeChat account of the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was also linked to a Chinese national, which could place him “in exactly the same boat that Scott Morrison is in”. “That means that the woman from Jiangsu province who appears to be linked to Anthony Albanese’s WeChat account could at any time be pressured, be persuaded or decide on her own accord to shut down or sell the account, and that situation is untenable,” Ryan said in an interview. “It would be my hope that both the Labor and Liberal parties agree to boycott WeChat.” A Lowy Institute survey of 1,040 adults in Australia who self-identify as of Chinese heritage conducted found two-thirds of those polled used WeChat either “often” or “sometimes” to read Chinese-language news. That research was conducted in November 2020. Ryan said it was in the interests of Australian democracy that, as much as possible, the political discussion with citizens “doesn’t go through that prism of the Chinese censorship apparatus” because that would “skew the discourse”. “WeChat certainly is an important tool for Chinese Australians to stay in contact with family and friends in the PRC, but it is essentially an extension of the Great Firewall outside of China,” Ryan said. “People outside China using WeChat are essentially in a bubble that is highly censored and heavily surveilled.” Guardian Australia asked Morrison’s office whether it had ever tried to secure a WeChat account without a Chinese national being an intermediary. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “That option was not made available to us despite being asked by Tencent for and providing proof in 2020 the account was managed on behalf of the prime minister.” Albanese said on Monday he would be happy to speak directly with Morrison about any potential security concerns. In December 2020, Morrison brushed off a decision by WeChat to censor his post complaining that the dispute over a Chinese official’s “post of a false image of an Australian soldier does not diminish our respect for and appreciation of our Chinese Australian community or indeed our friendship with the people of China”.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison WeChat: new owner amazed account entrusted to ‘single person’ in China,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/scott-morrison-wechat-new-owner-amazed-account-entrusted-to-single-person-in-china
1/26/2022,"Am I OK?, from the married directors Tig Notaro and Stephanie Allynne, attempts to put a fresh spin on the coming-out film, a sub-genre that often centers adolescents or works against conservative family; think Love, Simon, But I’m a Cheerleader, Pariah or Happiest Season. The 86-minute film, penned by Lauren Pomerantz (a longtime writer for Ellen DeGeneres’s daytime show), couples the bittersweet revelations of coming out in one’s 30s, years after many in an accepting environment bloom, with the spiky tenderness of an intimate, platonic female friendship.  Jane (Sonoya Mizuno) and Lucy (Dakota Johnson) are longtime best friends and partners in crime – it’s not disclosed for how long, but long enough for Jane to know the type of car Lucy wanted in high school (a Volvo) and for Lucy to read dispassionate Jane’s emotions through a quiver in her voice. The two are in their early 30s and more each other’s other half than anyone else, including Jane’s sweet, deferential boyfriend Danny (Jermaine Fowler). We see them opposite each other in their favorite diner booth, a yin-yang in the same bed, the other’s mirror in their regular yoga class. When the British-accented Jane, who moved to the US as a teenager, abruptly decides to accept a work offer to move to London, Lucy cracks. The shock, along with several tequilas and an admission by Jane that she once kissed a girl in high school (Am I OK? is sharp when depicting the emotional carelessness of straight women’s dabbling for their own fun), prompts Lucy to admit something she’s tiptoed around for years: she’s attracted to women. It’s not a surprising confession even 20 minutes into the film, given that Lucy balks at a nervous advance from friend Ben (Whitmer Thomas) and warms under the touch of Brittany (Kiersey Clemons), an affectionate masseuse at the spa where she’s a receptionist. The friends’ subsequent heart-to-heart – Lucy raw and embarrassed, Jane supportive, casual and apologetic that she didn’t ask sooner – is one of the film’s most moving, emotionally sharp scenes. “It just felt easier to keep it buried inside,” Lucy says through tears. “I feel so stupid and I don’t even know what I am.” It’s been a good Sundance for Dakota Johnson, who also stole the show as a thirtysomething single mother circling consequential decisions in Cooper Raiff’s Cha Cha Real Smooth. Here, she plays Lucy as unburdened yet boiling with shame, repressed feelings humming at the surface; her reluctance to come out now, at 32, is both sweet and bruising. It’s unclear, in the first third of the movie, if Lucy is so rocked by Jane’s announcement and jealous of her nascent bond with her annoying and phone-addled co-worker Kat (Molly Gordon) because of their best friendship or because of unconfessed romantic feelings. Thankfully, Pomerantz eschews a will-they-won’t-they plot or unrequited love between the two leads for thornier and more insightful threads: Lucy’s hesitant surrender to Brittany’s confusing flirtations, how Jane’s eagerness to help metastasizes into an instinct to control, and an eventual breakdown of communication between the two as things change. Am I OK? is strongest when embedded in the two friends’ well-worn, effusive bond, in sickness or in health – when the fight comes the barbs are believably lacerating, the kind only best friends can wield. Such sensitive handling makes some odd, discordant beats more off-putting. Both Kat and Jane’s boss Stu (Sean Hayes) are caricatures of self-absorption; a scene in which Kat and Jane attend a “hammock retreat” hosted by Notaro’s Sheila, in a long and obvious gray wig, plays as an off-key and unnecessary parody of Nine Perfect Strangers that belongs to a different film. Such diversions into full-on attempts at comedy distract from enticing depictions of Jane and Lucy’s gravitational bond and Lucy’s blossoming sense of self, but don’t derail them. By the end, as the two weigh whether to stay or go and what the future holds, Lucy and Jane’s banter flows in a familiar, comforting rhythm – the film finally finding its groove, all the sweeter for the time spent figuring it out.

1/26/2022,"Newcastle have made a €40m (£33.5m) offer for Lyon’s defensive midfielder Bruno Guimarães and are awaiting a response from the French club. The 24-year-old Brazil international has not indicated whether he would welcome a move to St James’ Park. Other suitors, including Arsenal and Juventus, are interested in buying him at the end of the season.  Guimarães joined Lyon in January 2020 from the Brazilian club Athletico Paranaense and made the first of his three appearances for Brazil that November. Newcastle’s need for signings was heightened when Joelinton, who has been playing in midfield, and the defender Jamaal Lascelles sustained injuries likely to keep them out for weeks. Newcastle have been targeting the Sevilla centre-back Diego Carlos but the Spanish club, who have signed the Manchester United forward Anthony Martial on loan, have decided not to sell despite lengthy negotiations and two bids. Newcastle are likely to test that resolve before Monday’s deadline. Robin Gosens, Atalanta’s left wing-back, is another player on Newcastle’s list but the Germany international’s preference is to join Internazionale, who are in advanced talks to sign him. Newcastle have also been trying to bring in Jesse Lingard on loan from Manchester United, with Tottenham’s Dele Alli regarded as a back-up option if that move cannot be concluded.",Sport/Football,Newcastle make £33.5m offer for Lyon midfielder Bruno Guimarães,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/newcastle-make-335m-offer-for-lyon-midfielder-bruno-guimaraes
