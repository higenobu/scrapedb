5/4/2022,"ROME—Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Pope Francis has floated the idea that he wants to take a trip to Kyiv to try to broker a ceasefire. But now he says he would prefer to go to Moscow to try to talk some sense into Vladimir Putin, who he has not outwardly condemned in the now nearly 3-month-old war and only did so lightly in a lengthy interview with an Italian newspaper. “I feel that before going to Kyiv I must go to Moscow,” he told Corriere Della Sera in an interview that ran on Tuesday. But the meeting would not exactly be to condemn Putin, based on what he told the paper. He said that the real “scandal” of Putin’s war is “NATO barking at Russia’s door,” which he said caused the Kremlin to “react badly and unleash the conflict.” Never mind that the 85-year-old pontiff is unable to walk after tearing a ligament in his knee for which he says he will soon have surgery, or that Putin won‘t even answer his calls. Francis repeated comments he has made in general audiences and in other interviews that the war is nothing more than a giant opportunity for a “trade in arms” and that it is still ongoing because of the constant shuttling of weapons to Ukraine. He has spoken twice by phone to Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky, but mostly to urge him not to fight back. He also went to the Russian embassy to the Holy See days after the invasion began to “register his concerns” about what was happening. “I don't know how to answer—I'm too far away—the question of whether it is right to supply the Ukrainians,” he told the paper. “The clear thing is that weapons are being tested there. The Russians now know that tanks are of little use and are thinking of other things. This is why wars are waged: to test the weapons we have produced. Few people are fighting this trade, but more should be done.” Watch: Pope Francis renews call for Mariupol humanitarian corridors Whether the Italian journalists didn’t ask—or whether he didn’t answer— there was no mention about what would happen if Ukrainians were not fiercely fighting back, whether it would mean a full annexation of the entire country, millions of deaths, or empowering an already insatiably power hungry Putin. Francis veered towards conspiracy theory as he blamed the international community for instigating the war. “You cannot think that a free state can make war on another free state,” he said. “In Ukraine, it seems that it was others who created the conflict. I am pessimistic but we must do everything possible to stop the war.” The pope then said that in a state visit to Rome by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, he was told, “the Russians have a plan, that everything will end on May 9” without giving any further explanation. May 9 is the day Russia celebrates its liberation and the end of World War II. The one person Francis will not meet is Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, who the pope fears is becoming “Putin’s altar boy.” Francis said he spoke with him on the phone for 40 minutes on March 15. “And I told him: I completely fail to understand this,” he said. “Brother, we are not state clerics; we cannot use the language of politics, but that of Jesus. We are pastors of the same holy people of God.” He said that 40 days ago he asked his secretary of state to start the process of organizing a visit to Moscow instead of Ukraine, but that Putin had not responded. “I am not going to Kyiv for now,” he said. “I feel that I must not go. First I must go to Moscow. First I must meet Putin. But I am also a priest, what can I do? I do what I can. If Putin would only open the door.” News of the potential trip to Moscow put the Vatican press corps who travel with the pontiff on high alert, with many wondering if they would be arrested if they reported on discussions of the war if they were in Russia. But even the pontiff concedes that a meeting in Moscow is a long shot. “I fear that Putin cannot, and does not, want to have this meeting at this time,” he said. “But how can you not stop so much brutality?” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/4/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The District of Columbia attorney general said Tuesday that his office had reached a $750,000 settlement to resolve a lawsuit that alleged former President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee overpaid for events at the Trump International Hotel to enrich the former president’s family in the process. Attorney General Karl Racine announced the settlement agreement in the case against the Presidential Inaugural Committee, the Trump Organization and the Trump International Hotel in Washington in a tweet on Tuesday. The document had not yet been signed by a judge. The agreement says the case is being resolved “to avoid the cost, burden, and risks of further litigation” and that the organizations “dispute these allegations on numerous grounds and deny having engaged in any wrongdoing or unlawful conduct.” As part of the agreement, the defendants will pay the District of Columbia a total of $750,000, which will be used to benefit three nonprofit organizations, the settlement paperwork says. “We’re resolving our lawsuit and sending the message that if you violate DC nonprofit law—no matter how powerful you are—you’ll pay,” Racine said in a tweet. Racine has said the committee misused nonprofit funds and coordinated with the hotel’s management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. He said one of the event’s planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates, a top campaign official at the time. The committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. But the committee’s spending has drawn mounting scrutiny. Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who cooperated in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms, the attorney general’s office has said. In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was “a bit worried about the optics” of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said. Prosecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didn’t consider those options.",Politics/Associated Press,DC reaches $750K settlement in Trump inaugural lawsuit,https://news.yahoo.com/dc-reaches-750k-settlement-trump-143257315.html
5/4/2022,"Over 100,000 petitioners are urging the U.K. government to help save a retired British geologist currently facing the death penalty in Iraq.

Jim Fitton, 66, has been accused of trying to smuggle historic artifacts out of the Middle Eastern country and has been detained there for five weeks.

On April 28, Jim’s daughter Leila launched a petition via Change.org asking the British government to take action against the death sentence.

The scientist, who shares a home in Malaysia with his wife, Sarijah, worked for oil and gas companies. He reportedly took some stones and shards of broken pottery as souvenirs while visiting the archaeological site Eridu as part of a geology and archeology tour.

The items, however, were eventually judged to be artifacts. Under Iraqi law, ""whoever exported or intended to export, deliberately, an antiquity, from Iraq, shall be punishable with execution.""

“Whilst on the tour, our father visited historical sites around Iraq, where his tour group found fragments of stones and shards of broken pottery in piles on the ground,” Leila narrated in the petition. “These fragments were in the open, unguarded and with no signage warning against removal.""

She added that the tour leaders also took shards from the site as souvenirs.

“Tour members were told that this would not be an issue, as the broken shards had no economic or historical value,” she wrote. “Now the tour leader, another British citizen, has passed away from a stroke in custody in Baghdad, and our father awaits his fate.”

Leila, who has not seen her father for over two years now due to COVID-19 restrictions, revealed in a recent petition update that her father had no legal representation when the investigation phase of the case was being heard.

She added that she and her family were forced to create a petition after failing to get help from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).

According to Leila, they are still hopeful that the FCDO will help them with its “legal and constitutional powers” to secure a meeting with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and other judiciary officials, so they can present a proposal seeking to “have the case closed before trial.”

Leila said their lawyer had drafted the proposal, which “cites the clear lack of criminality, that Jim is a victim of poor guidance and circumstance, and also cites the huge investment that the UK has made in the Iraqi governmental and judicial framework through FCDO funding in the past few years.”

Jim’s family is hoping to get immediate assistance before the hearing for the sentencing court starts on May 8.

Wera Hobhouse, Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, raised Jim’s case with ministers in the House of Commons.

""We are pressing the Foreign Office to intervene but sadly they are continuing to refuse,” Hobhouse said. ""I cannot understand why the Foreign Office is not intervening when Jim's life lays in the balance.""

In response, FCDO said it is already providing consular support to the family and has been in contact with Iraqi authorities.

""We understand the urgency of the case, and have already raised our concerns with the Iraqi authorities regarding the possible imposition of the death penalty in Mr. Fitton's case and the UK's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle,"" a letter sent by Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling to Hobhouse last week.

5/4/2022,"Kim Kardashian said she cut carbs and lost 16 pounds in 3 weeks to fit into her Met Gala dress. Dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told Insider her comments are ""dangerous"" and such drastic weight loss is not recommended. You don't need to cut out carbs to lose weight, and it can lead to water weight loss, not necessarily fat loss. Kim Kardashian said she lost 16 pounds in three weeks to fit into her dress for this year's Met Gala. Kardashian wore the iconic ""naked"" dress Marilyn Monroe wore to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to John F. Kennedy in 1962, but crash dieted to fit into it, Insider's Anneta Konstantinides reported. The reality TV star told Vogue she cut out sugar and carbs to drop weight, but dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told Insider this isn't healthy or necessary to lose weight, and carb cutting can result in water weight loss, not fat loss. ""I didn't starve myself, but I was so strict,"" Kardashian said. ""Just the cleanest veggies and protein."" Ludlam-Raine said comments like Kardashian's can be ""dangerous to vulnerable people,"" such as those with an eating disorder, and recommends slower, more sustainable weight loss. In addition to cutting out carbs and sugar, Kardashian said she ran on a treadmill and wore a sauna suit twice a day, causing the body to sweat and lose more water. Ludlam-Raine said these factors, combined with cutting carbs, could lead to mostly water weight loss. ""I would go far as saying it's impossible to lose 16 lbs of fat in three weeks,"" she said. When carbs and sugars are cut from the diet, the body loses water and glycogen (carb) stores from the liver and muscles, which fill back up fast as soon as you start eating normally again, Ludlam-Raine said. For every one gram of carbs we eat, our body holds on to three to four grams of water (unlike with protein and fats), which means that no-carb diets often make people think they've lost fat, but it's actually mainly water, she said. You don't need to cut carbs to lose weight, and it's not recommended. ""It's not sustainable to cut out all carbs (and sugar) long term, as they're what our body and brain uses as fuel,"" Ludlam-Raine said. Carbs provide energy, fiber, nutrients and phytochemicals which keep the body healthy and functioning optimally. If you want to lose fat, cutting carbs isn't advised as it can lead to the body breaking down muscle for energy instead, nutrition coach Dr. Mike Molloy previously told Insider. Restricting foods you enjoy can also lead to a ""binge-restrict"" cycle, Ludlam-Raine said, where you end up overeating a food you've banned from your diet. Kardashian posted on her Instagram story after the Met Gala that she was ""so excited"" to eat pizza and donuts for the first time in weeks. ""What we eat should fuel both our body and soul, healthy eating is about balance and sustainability, whilst being happy with what you're eating too,"" Ludlam-Raine said. One pound of fat holds around 3,500 calories, which is why most health experts recommend losing around one to two pounds a week, Ludlam-Raine said. The more weight you have to lose, the faster you can expect to lose it, so if you're already lean, healthy weight loss might be more like two lbs a month. To lose weight healthily, aim to eat in a gentle calorie deficit of around 500 calories a day, Ludlam-Raine said. Bear in mind, however, that fat loss is affected by multiple factors, such as hormones, and scale weight can fluctuate for various reasons. To avoid regaining weight, slower weight loss is advised by fat loss coaches. ""Anything that's super extreme is ultimately designed to fail,"" Molloy told Insider. ""Using relatively extreme approaches, you're simply setting yourself up for a rebound in the long-term.""
