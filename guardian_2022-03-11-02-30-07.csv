3/11/2022,"The phone rings and Volodymyr Zelenskiy reaches into his pocket. The German chancellor is on the line, to inform him that “we decided to take your country into the European Union”. “Oh fuck,” Zelenskiy says, as Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, the EU anthem, soars into life. It is an old clip from Zelenskiy’s acting days, when he played Ukraine’s accidental president in the hit TV show Servant of the People. It was filmed several years before Russia’s all-out attack began, before bombs fell on a maternity hospital in besieged Mariupol, before a six-year old girl died of dehydration, under the rubble of her destroyed home, according to Ukrainian officials. I can’t wrap my mind around the existence of this clip. pic.twitter.com/1XvBYWlMxg The clip went viral last week, because the question of Ukraine’s EU membership is no longer a joke in a TV show but an urgent question. The real President Zelenskiy filed Ukraine’s application for EU membership five days into Russia’s invasion, calling for “immediate accession via a new special procedure”. As EU leaders gathered on Thursday to discuss that bid in the historically charged setting of Versailles, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, urged them to make it happen. “Ukraine is a strong force for good, a brave and intelligent nation which will contribute greatly to the political, economic, cultural and social strength of the EU after this war is over,” he wrote in the Financial Times. “It will be a matter of prestige, as well as strength, for the EU to have a member like us.” While the EU has surprised observers with its unity and readiness to cast aside old doctrines to stand against Russia’s aggression, EU membership for Ukraine appears to be a step too far. This is not for lack of support. The EU remembers the 2014 Euromaidan revolution, when peaceful protesters lost their lives to defend Ukraine’s right to choose a European future. Eight member states, all in central and eastern Europe, have called on the EU to “immediately” grant Ukraine EU candidate status and open the process of negotiations. But supporters know it is an uphill battle. “They have even more values than many of us, but, practically, it will be very challenging,” said one senior diplomat. Old member states, including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, do not want Ukraine to get a shortcut to EU membership. Officials point out Ukraine needs to be able to absorb the 80,000-page EU rule book, the acquis communautaire, encompassing everything from air pollution to zoonoses (infectious diseases from animals) monitoring. Underpinning this mountain of technical regulations is a sound public administration, an independent judiciary and a market economy. “Let’s be fair, Ukraine is nowhere near that point, especially because of what Mr Putin has done,” a senior EU diplomat said, adding that even before the war, Ukraine was “not moving in the right direction” on the Copenhagen criteria – EU standards on democracy, the rule of law and the economy. “We want to say yes to Ukraine as much as possible: moral support, show sympathy with the Ukrainian people, make clear they are part of our community of values,” the diplomat added, suggested Ukraine could go well beyond its existing trade and association agreement, via participation in the EU Erasmus student exchange programme or ministerial attendance at EU meetings. “I think Ukrainians are making [membership] too big an issue and by listening to others who are making this into an easy political decision,” the person said. The EU diplomat ruled out the suggestion that the EU’s reluctance stemmed from concern over antagonising the Kremlin, but supporters of Ukraine’s EU membership fear this is the real reason. Like Nato, the EU also has its own mutual defence clause, where an attack on one is an attack on all. “There are governments [in old member states] who think we can negotiate with Putin and exchange Ukraine’s European aspirations for peace,” another senior diplomat told the Guardian. “And I just think this is an illusion.” Long before Ukraine’s membership bid, the EU’s old member states were wary of EU enlargement and burned by democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, or lingering corruption in Bulgaria and Romania. “Enlargement changes to a certain extent the nature of the European Union, so it is a question of fundamental existential importance for every leader, for every country,” an EU official said. And a fast track for Ukraine risks antagonising six western Balkan countries that have been at various stages of the EU membership queue, since leaders declared they had a “European perspective” nearly 20 years ago. So far, the divisions have produced a classic Brussels compromise, where EU leaders will declare that “Ukraine belongs to our European family”, according to a draft text seen by the Guardian. EU leaders will call on the European commission to give an opinion on Ukraine’s membership application, adding that “pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership”. Heather Grabbe, a former commission official who worked on EU enlargement, thinks the EU could do so much more. “What Ukraine really needs is reassurance that Europe will not abandon them in the face of Russian aggression, that Europe won’t force them to choose between Europe and Russia, that they are fundamentally European, whatever Russia does,” said Grabbe, now the director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. “It would just be outrageous for the European Union to make Ukraine’s European future dependent on Russia’s will,” she told the Guardian, pointing out that if the EU defined its borders according to the Kremlin it would hand Putin victory in one of his war aims. However, the EU’s demanding entry criteria should not be watered down for Ukraine, she said. More immediately, the EU should include Ukraine in its flagship policy: the green deal, which aims for net zero emissions by 2050. The green deal, Grabbe said, should be a core part of Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction, in one move phasing out its reliance on Russian fossil fuels and deepening European integration. “That is very practical because it unlocks a lot of money for Ukraine and it also starts the transition of the Ukrainian economy where it would be much more in line with the European economy,” she said. In the fictional clip, Ukraine’s membership dream ended when the German chancellor realised she had made a mistake: it was Montenegro she wanted in the EU. Ode to Joy cuts out abruptly, the president’s face crumples: “I see, OK – my congratulations, yes, to Montenegro.” As Ukrainians die for what the real Zelenskiy has cast as a fight to be “equal members of Europe”, Ukraine’s government may be less understanding if they perceive the EU’s door remains closed.",News/World news,Will the EU start to take Ukraine’s membership seriously?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/will-the-eu-start-to-take-ukraines-membership-seriously
3/11/2022,"Idaho’s house of representatives has passed a bill that would criminalize gender-affirming medical procedures for transgender youth and make it a felony punishable by life imprisonment for anyone who helps a child travel across state lines to gender-affirming healthcare. The bill, approved on Tuesday, targets medical measures that include vasectomy, hysterectomy, mastectomy, puberty-blocking medication and supraphysiological doses of testosterone or estrogen. The bill will now move on to the state’s Republican-controlled senate. If approved, the Republican governor, Brad Little, could either sign it into law or veto it. “Whoever knowingly removes or causes, permits, or facilitates the removal of a child from this state for the purpose of facilitating any act prohibited … by this section shall be guilty of a felony,” the bill states. “Any person convicted of a violation … shall be guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not more than life.” Civil rights and LGBTQ+ advocacy campaigns condemned the proposed bill. “By making it impossible for doctors to provide care for their patients, transgender youth are denied the age-appropriate, best practice, medically necessary, gender-affirming care that a new study just found reduces the risk of moderate or severe depression by 60% and suicidality by 73%,” Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said. “Bills like HB 675 are being pushed across the country by well-funded, national, anti-trans groups to mobilize their political base,” Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said. “These bills do nothing to invest and protect Idaho youth and families and Idahoans deserve better.” According to a 2019 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 2% of high school students identified as trans, and 35% had attempted suicide in the previous year. According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills are currently under consideration in state legislatures across the country. State representative Bruce Skaug, the bill’s lead sponsor, said that the bill was “about protecting children”. He also compared gender-affirming treatments to minors drinking alcohol and getting tattoos. The bill passed with a near party-line vote, with Republicans winning by 55-13. Dr Fred Wood, the House’s only physician, joined 12 Democrats in voting against the bill. “Our transgender youth are so incredibly courageous, and I know how stressful it has been for transgender youth and their families as they’ve watched this bill move through this body,” said the Democratic representative Lauren Neocochea during its debate. “An Idaho doctor has had to assist three transgender youth related to their suicide attempts since this bill has been introduced. We need to trust those parents and providers to make these deeply personal decisions,” she added. The Idaho vote comes as the Florida senate also passed a bill on Tuesday which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Last week, a Texas judge blocked the state from investigating the parents of a trans teenager over gender-affirming treatments after the order by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, that officials look into reports of such treatments as abuse.",News/US news,Idaho bill that criminalizes medical trans youth treatments passes house,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/idaho-bill-trans-youth-treatment-ban-passes-house
3/11/2022,"Florida has approved a measure that would create a statewide office to investigate election crimes – the first of its kind in the United States. Voter fraud is extremely rare both nationwide and in Florida. Nonetheless, the new office of election crime and security will have 25 positions to investigate election fraud and be funded with more than $3m, Daniel Perez, a Republican state representative who backed the bill, said on the floor of the Florida house this week. It will be housed within the department of state, which is responsible for overseeing elections in Florida and whose head is appointed by the governor. The department will be authorized to investigate any alleged violations of Florida election law and oversee a voter fraud hotline. Each year, the agency will be required to provide a report to the governor and state legislature on how many investigations it conducted the previous year as well as how many matters were referred to another agency for further investigation or prosecution. The measure passed the Florida house on Wednesday and final approval from the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, is expected shortly. The unit is slightly scaled back from what DeSantis called for in January, when he requested $6m for the office and wanted 52 staffers. DeSantis praised the administration of Florida’s election in November 2020, saying “The way Florida did it, I think, inspires confidence. I think that’s how elections should be run.” The Florida department of state received 262 election fraud complaint forms and referred 75 of those to prosecutors, according to the Washington Post. More than 11 million Floridians voted in 2020. “There is absolutely no reason for an elections police force,” Kirk Bailey, the political director of the Florida chapter of the ACLU said in a statement. “The handful of cases of intentional misconduct that have been prosecuted in the past year demonstrates that the existing system works. There are no guardrails in this legislation to prevent the proposed office from becoming politicized.” Beyond the election police force, the bill contains other new significant voting restrictions. It raises the penalty for collecting more than two mail-in ballots from a misdemeanor to a felony punishable with prison time. It also increases the maximum fines on third-party voter registration groups if they don’t turn in a voter’s registration within 14 days. The fine maximum fine increases to $50,000. “The Republican leadership in the state of Florida has added to their notorious reputation of passing restrictive voter suppression laws with the passage of SB 524. This unnecessary bill that Governor DeSantis has vowed to sign into law is nothing more than a tool to further insulate Republican political power at the expense of Floridian’s voting rights,” said Genesis Robinson, the political director of Equal Ground, a civic action group. During debate on the bill this week, several Democrats pressed Perez on whether the bill would allow for punishment for those who accidentally collect more than two ballots or misplace a voter registration. Perez said he was not concerned about voters being wrongly punished because prosecutors have discretion over how to pursue cases and the penalties were needed to deter bad actors. Other provisions in the bill would require elections officials to annually look for ineligible voters on the state’s voter rolls. It requires the state’s motor vehicle department to notify election officials of people who indicate they are non-citizen. Texas recently experienced severe problems by relying on similar data to try to purge its voter rolls. The bill also imposes new hurdles for voters to get ballot initiatives, eliminates the term “drop box” in state law and calls them “secure ballot intake stations”, and extends a ban on private funding for elections to include litigation. “It is wrong for Governor DeSantis and state legislators to take money needed for community investment and use it to diminish the voices of that community. It is wrong for them to criminalize Floridians exercising their freedom to vote. And it is wrong for them to target communities of color,” Caren Short, the interim deputy legal director for voting rights at the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund said in a statement.",News/US news,Voting rights advocates decry Florida’s new office for election crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/florida-election-crimes-office-voting-rights

3/11/2022,"Chelsea became champions of the world this time last month. If you didn’t know any better, you’d assume everyone has been basking in the glow of this epochal achievement ever since. But you do know better. You know that Kepa ended up looking quite the toolkit in the League Cup final. Again. You know that the team flirted with FA Cup humiliation at the hands of Luton. And you know that, geopolitical events having led to Roman Abramovich putting the club up for sale, an unprecedented era of success is coming to an end. Chelsea are still champions of the world for the next 11 months, of course, and whatever happens now will always have a roll of honour stretching halfway down the Kings Rahd. So, small violins and all that. Still, everything in context. No, it’s been downhill ever since they lifted that damned Fifa pot, and if all the aforementioned wasn’t bad enough, events this morning threw a cat into a tin full of pigeons, then firmly closed the lid. Abramovich has been hit with sanctions by the UK government and had his assets frozen, plunging Chelsea into chaos. Of course, this pales into insignificance when compared to events in Ukraine, but our old pal context helps us here again – and to be fair, people are allowed to be worried about different stuff of varying importance at the same time. This decision – preposterously trumpeted on social media by the Oligarch Taskforce, the UK government seemingly now being advised by Trey Parker and Matt Stone – means Abramovich’s plans to sell the club have come to an abrupt halt. Given rumours that he may have sold up to the bloke running the New York Jets, this may be no bad thing for Chelsea in the long run. At least everyone has time to stop and think. But little else about the situation is ideal, with the club now operating under terms of a special licence that allows them to keep going despite the asset freeze. For example, the club are allowed to pay their staff and fulfil their fixtures: tonight’s game at Norwich, scheduled to kick off at 7.30pm with Thomas Tuchel losing his rag in interviews at 7.15pm and 9.45pm, is still on. But next week’s Big Cup tie in Lille, for example, is momentarily up in the air, given the club are now only allowed to spend £20,000 per game on travel. Shipping a world-class squad plus staff and all their gear around the globe is twice as expensive as it sounds. The club will be subject to a transfer ban (again) and won’t be allowed to offer anything to Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen or Dave, all of whom are out of contract at the end of the season. The club’s sponsorship with Three has been suspended, while the Stamford Bridge hotel is no longer allowed to take bookings. If nothing else, that reduces the possibility of the politically-minded reserving a room with a view to a dirty protest. Perhaps worst of all, Chelsea are no longer able to sell a single thing, from players to match tickets and other general tat. And so all of those Champions of the World T-shirts (navy/white, £20) will remain piled up symbolically behind the shutters of the club megastore, gathering dust for an as-yet-unspecified period of time. If that doesn’t convince you that last month’s Fifa victory was cursed, nothing will.

3/11/2022,"Adrian Lyne is 81 and hasn’t made a film for 20 years. The last one was Unfaithful, a top erotic thriller to add to his sweaty collection (Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, 9½ Weeks). It won an Oscar nomination for Diane Lane, who we saw flushed on a train, recalling her busy afternoon with Olivier Martinez. So, on the surface, Lyne seems a strange choice to direct Deep Water, based on a book by Patricia Highsmith about a sterile marriage. Vic Van Allen is a small-time press publisher in New England who breeds snails in the garage. His wife, Melinda, takes a string of dim younger lovers. Her trysts are not detailed; instead, Highsmith concentrates on Vic. Lyne’s update chucks much of this. We see the sex, for starters. Melinda’s indiscretions are made explicit in their social circles. At a house party in the opening scene, a friend approaches Vic, gestures to Melinda and her new fella and asks: “They fuckin’?” And Vic – recast as the inventor of drone microchips – not only cares about the adultery, but is aroused by it, too. “The hideous truth is that jealousy is an aphrodisiac,” chuckles Lyne. “It’s hateful and awful and destructive, but it is!” He grins down the camera in our interview: plain navy background, red Hawaiian shirt. He looks like Bill Murray in space. “I wanted to introduce a kind of complicity,” he says. “Vic was interested in her sexually, but tried to be urbane about it. He’s rejected and you can see that he’s decimated by that and takes refuge in his snails.” From time to time, Melinda chucks him a crumb: half a handjob, vague fellatio. These sequences are not in the novel and “a lot of people” wanted to ditch them. “The instinct is to make it mundane. Endlessly, they said: ‘Why the snails? Take the snails out!’ But it’s always the bumps that are the most interesting.” So Deep Water is a sort of erotic thriller after all, just one with a lot more gastropods than most. All Lyne’s signature moves are there – baths! Banisters! Very big kitchens! – but there is substance as well as style. There are also abrupt and amazing bits of domestic freakery that Lyne says he stole from Samantha, his wife of 48 years. Working with Lyne, says the actor Finn Whittrock a few days later, was “a dream come true. My film-maker friends were pretty much in awe of him. He’s an auteur, but never quite got the credit for being so – because of the subject matter and maybe the popularity, too.” This is probably correct. Something about Lyne’s success (Fatal Attraction was the highest grossing film of 1987) as well as his self-deprecation means he has never been a critical darling, even when he has made movies without synths and shagging. He is blithe about it at first, then, when pressed, admits being close to tears reading reviews and “sometimes getting a bit pissed off, because I don’t think they realise how much you put into it”. Anyway, in Deep Water, Wittrock plays Melinda’s third lover, Dom: brainy as well as dishy and therefore a big threat. Everyone was lovely on set, he says, but he did feel a bit of a third wheel. Or perhaps fourth, as Lyne and his leads, Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas, shared “this intense intimacy. It was a triangle. A little posse they created.” Lyne introduced the pair when he screen-tested them at his house in late 2019. They then became a couple until breaking up early last year. “I got a very real sense that the chemistry was good,” remembers Lyne. “I remember feeling that with Glenn [Close] and Michael [Douglas].” Match-making is “pleasing, really. You just pray they won’t fall out. And they didn’t!” Directors have to be as close to actors on a shoot as a spouse, he says – or at least a therapist. This is why he didn’t like having an intimacy coordinator to police the sex scenes. “It implies a lack of trust. And that’s all I have. If the actors don’t trust me, I might as well go home. I’ve gotta make myself vulnerable for them; for them to know I would spill my guts, do anything for them. Then, with any luck, I get the same back.” When he shot Fatal Attraction, Close and Douglas swigged champagne before their first sex scene, margaritas before their second. “You can’t do that now!” he says wistfully. “Why is everything so serious? God, it’s not like they’re gonna get paralysed or something.” Actually, there isn’t really a lot of sex in that film, he says – maybe a minute in total. “But that’s what people remember, I suppose because it interests them.” For someone who has flogged it so profitably, Lyne does not seem that interested in sex, nor in nudity – possibly after so many years living in France. “You see a woman’s breasts on television. You don’t even think about it. You go to the beach and see tiny kids running around naked. What could possibly be more natural? “Yet, in America, they’ll blur out the buttocks of a four-year-old. I find that dangerous. The suggestion that a little child naked could in any way be prurient I think is truly fucked up. That sort of loss of innocence is a pity.” Lyne likes living near Marseille and thinks “you’re much better off in Europe”. Unfaithful was a Chabrol adaptation; Truffaut is his hero. He loves Truffaut’s line about Americans making films about heroes and Europeans about losers – and loves it even more when I relate that to Affleck in Deep Water. He looks wrecked; a bleary husk next to a stack of beefcakes. “He really worked hard at a kind of stillness and vulnerability. At times, he said: ‘You know, it’s not in my DNA.’ And it was! I didn’t want him to be sort of Irish and ebullient and Boston. He was very childlike, in a way. I’m very proud of what he did, because I believe that he loved those snails.” Another big chuckle. Yet despite his years shuttling between Provence and Los Angeles, when you speak to Lyne, it is as if he could be sitting next door. “He does seem extremely English,” says Whittrock. “I remember being a bit shocked that this is the guy who made Unfaithful. Like: how did that come out of you? There is a kind of civility to him that’s an interesting juxtaposition to the movies he makes. Maybe that’s why they can become heightened and not fall into the muck. There’s a purity. He does intellectualise, even though the movies are so visceral.” I put this to Lyne, who bats it back amicably. “Well, there’s no need to be rude! If he thought I was unpleasant, I wouldn’t get a lot out of him! And Finn was wonderful. I really dragged him through the mud, but he was so sweet.” And off he goes again: mild-mannered and happy, telling another story about how fantastic an actor was. After Whittock, it is the turn of Tim Robbins. He remembers an especially intense scene with him in Jacob’s Ladder. The cameraman was crying and he told Robbins he was wonderful. “I remember his eyes were all bloodshot from yelling and he said to me: ‘I know.’ “And in that moment, I really loved the man. I just really fucking loved him for what he’d given me. When you get something good out of an actor, you feel you’ve taken a piece of him – literally a lump of him – that he’ll never get back. You’ve got it! The movie’s got it! He gave me that! The feeling’s so marvellous. That’s why I do it.” And suddenly Lyne doesn’t look like Bill Murray any more. He looks Hannibal Lecter at his sinister best.

For more than a quarter of an hour he ranted, loudly enough to be audible from the office next door. And the cause of this reported towering outburst from the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow? Not some constitutional outrage perpetrated by a government riding roughshod over due process; not even the high stakes of the parliamentary battle over Brexit, which made him a hero to so many remainers. According to a withering report from an independent parliamentary appeals panel this week, which deemed him both a bully and a “repeatedly dishonest” witness, he thought the clerk of the House, Lord Lisvane, had put a paper on the agenda for an upcoming meeting without his knowledge. You don’t have to work in politics to feel a pang of recognition for the “stomach-clenching anxiety” the incoming Speaker’s secretary, Kate Emms, described feeling, on seeing her new boss publicly belittle her outgoing predecessor, Angus Sinclair. On Fleet Street when I was starting out, being screamed at on a daily basis was simply regarded as routine. A famously expletive-ridden executive once delivered such a loud dressing-down that someone on another floor was widely rumoured to have called security, convinced the building was actually under attack. But bullying happens everywhere, from school staff rooms to factory floors, Premier League dressing rooms to the NHS. The TV dramatisation of Adam Kay’s medical memoir This Is Going to Hurt captures the contempt heaped by some senior doctors on junior ones, who in turn dish it out to even more lowly medical students as if they were all still at a boarding school run by particularly sadistic prefects. The series is a black comedy, but management by fear isn’t funny. Being bullied at work is every bit as miserable as being bullied at school; the same sick sense of foreboding every Monday morning, the same constant nervous vigilance, and often the same irrational sense of shame. Months of being publicly picked on can reduce the most confident person to a puddle of doubt and self-loathing. Tell someone they’re useless often enough and they can start to believe it, or at least to worry that complaining will probably be interpreted as weakness. Reporting an MP for rudeness, one anonymous senior clerk explained to the panel, “can only end up with you being seen as in some way inadequate”. And Bercow’s liberal public persona gave him the perfect ideological cover for those private, spittle-flecked rages, which according to Sinclair once saw him smash a mobile phone to smithereens on a desk. He pitched himself as “a moderniser, a reformer, a progressive change-maker” whose first great modernising project had effectively been himself. Having started his career on the hard right of the Conservative party, he ended it by burnishing his feminist credentials and attacking what he depicted as stuffy old reactionaries at Westminster. He was a creative and activist Speaker who pushed through some welcome changes, from boosting the power of backbenchers and hosting receptions for gay rights charities in his grand Westminster apartments, to opening a parliamentary nursery. But it’s an unusual kind of feminist who stands accused – as Lisvane wrote in a resignation letter he drafted but didn’t send – of pushing the first ever female Speaker’s secretary out of her job, “damaging her health and making a sham of your alleged commitment to diversity”. And modernising zeal doesn’t explain why Bercow, who has dismissed the report’s findings as a “kangaroo court” verdict, reportedly threw a tantrum at an airport when told he couldn’t take toothpaste in his hand luggage. True progressivism means treating others with basic respect, even if you do think they are fellow middle-aged white men who (as he once reportedly told Lisvane) “come here with your privileged background and offer your opinion”. As the panel concluded, historians will judge whether he was one of parliament’s great reformers but “there was no need to act as a bully in order to achieve that”. He should, they felt, be banned for life from having a parliamentary pass. Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the House of Commons he famously dismissed as “stupid”, deserves some retrospective credit for doggedly pursuing bullying charges not just against Bercow but more widely. Yet even after BBC Newsnight ran a detailed account of his behaviour in 2018, too many MPs protected him. At a critical point in the battle over Brexit, Bercow had found parliamentary time for MPs opposed to it, and grateful remainers closed ranks. The former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett was at least honest enough to spell the deal out. Abuse was terrible and should be stopped, she said, but “yes, if it comes to it, the constitutional future of this country, the most difficult decision we’ve made for hundreds of years, yes it trumps bad behaviour”. Perhaps even now some feel this trade-off was justified. But it still beggars belief that Jeremy Corbyn recommended Bercow, who defected to Labour after leaving the Speaker’s chair, for a peerage. The truth is that bullying flourishes in badly run institutions, under managers who don’t know any other way to manage, and where people have been browbeaten into believing that this is somehow normal. But it isn’t actually normal to shout and swear and throw things; it isn’t normal to wake up every day feeling sick at the thought of going into work. Routine hazing of the kind Adam Kay has described is no way for juniors to learn their craft, and nor should explosive rage be the price you pay for working at the heart of power in Westminster. Of all the workplaces in the world, the one that makes the rules for everyone else’s office life should have had the gumption to say so.

3/11/2022,"Mercedes have firmly refuted suggestions their new car for the Formula One season features any illegal components. Responding to reported comments from Red Bull, the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, insisted their innovative new sidepod design unveiled in Bahrain was within the new regulations. When Lewis Hamilton took to the track for the final test this week in Bahrain, his Mercedes was radically different from the one the team ran at the first test in Barcelona. They have used the side impact structures as fins and mirror mounts and in so doing have dramatically decreased the size of their sidepods. The intent is to improve airflow and increase downforce. The design has the potential to give Mercedes a major pace advantage going into the new season, which begins in Bahrain on 20 March. On Thursday morning Germany’s Auto Motor und Sport reported that Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, had already called the car’s legality into question. “From our point of view, Mercedes went a step too far,” he said. “That doesn’t correspond to the spirit of the regulations. For us, these wings are illegal.” In a surprising twist Red Bull quickly and strenuously denied Horner had made any comments about the Mercedes. Nonetheless Wolff responded by noting that although they were the only team to have adopted such a radical approach, their car had been designed in full consultation with F1’s governing body, the FIA, which had confirmed that it was within the regulations during development. “When you go down a specific development direction, the FIA scrutinises it, and you make them a part of the process,” he said. “We were keen in not running alone, but being in touch with the FIA that is why I think it will be OK. It is clear that when you come with an innovation it creates the kind of debate that we are having here. That was expected.” And given there are also new rules of governance this year, Mercedes may yet face the design becoming outlawed should enough teams believe it confers an unfair advantage. F1’s director of motorsport, Ross Brawn, was at the helm of the new regulations for this season, the biggest shake-up the sport has experienced since the 1980s, aimed at improving the chances of overtaking. Brawn admitted the Mercedes approach, which he described as “extreme” had not been expected and noted that, even if the car is within the regulations, such innovations could now be banned mid-season should eight of the 10 teams (known as a “supermajority”) agree. “I think there’s no doubt that the Mercedes concept we didn’t anticipate, it’s a very extreme interpretation of the regulations,” he said. “From our perspective, it’s largely about does it affect the objective of the regulations? From the teams’ perspective, they want to be sure that no one’s taken an interpretation that they don’t feel is correct. So I think there’s going to be a lot of debate in the next few days.” The other teams will have the opportunity to protest against the design before next week’s race but as yet it remains to be seen whether Mercedes have indeed stolen a march on the rest of the field. On Thursday they ran the car with the intent of just putting miles on the clock and checking long-run performance without setting out to push to its limits – a task that they will probably leave until the final day of testing on Saturday. Hamilton was fifth fastest in the first session and his Mercedes teammate George Russell ninth overall.",Sport/Sport,"New Mercedes F1 car has no illegal parts, insists team principal Toto Wolff",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/new-mercedes-f1-car-has-no-parts-says-team-principal-toto-wolff
3/11/2022,"The far-right Vox party is set to form part of a regional Spanish government for the first time after cutting a deal to run the north-western autonomous community of Castilla y León with its bitter rivals in the conservative People’s party (PP). The deal, which comes almost a month after the PP’s decision to call regional elections failed to produce the absolute majority it had hoped for, follows weeks of wrangling amid a PP leadership crisis. Although the PP finished first in February’s vote, its victory was pyrrhic and proved yet another misstep for its leader, Pablo Casado, who will stand down next month. Emboldened by finishing in third place behind the Socialists – and picking up 16 new seats in the 81-seat regional parliament – Vox had pushed for a place in government. On Thursday, Alfonso Fernández-Mañueco, the incumbent PP president of Castilla y León, finally acceded to its demands, saying his party had reached an agreement with Vox that would “allow for a solid and stable government”. According to reports, Vox will be given the regional vice-presidency, three regional ministries and the speakership of the Castilla y León parliament. Although the party has in the past supported the formation of PP-led administrations in Madrid, Andalucía and Murcia, this is the first time it has secured a place in a regional government. The agreement was swiftly criticised by the Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), which governs Spain in coalition with the far-left Unidas Podemos alliance. The PSOE’s vice-secretary general, Adriana Lastra, said it was a “pact of shame” that had brought the far right back into power for the first time since the end of the Franco dictatorship. Lastra also laid the blame at the door of Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the PP president of Galicia, who is set to take over from Casado. “The far right is back in government 40 years on, thanks to Feijóo,” she tweeted. “Today is a bad day for Castilla y León and for Spanish democracy.” Her comments came hours after Feijóo said that Spain needed “a new politics that listens and offers moderation and calm”. Vox – which has called for a “reconquest” of Spain, the building of an “unbreachable wall” around the north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and the repealing of laws on gender-based violence – regularly rails against what it sees as the hegemony of political correctness. Vox has managed to become the third largest party in Spain’s national parliament by exploiting culture wars, discontent with the country’s two main political parties and the fallout from the 2017 Catalan independence crisis. Polls suggest it is now nipping at the heels of the PP, which, under Casado, has had a contradictory relationship with its far-right rival. In October 2020 – less than two years before his party agreed the Castilla y León coalition – Casado rounded on Vox, accusing it of practising a politics based on “fear, anger, resentment and revenge”.",News/World news,Spain’s far-right Vox breaks through into regional government,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/spain-far-right-vox-regional-government-castilla-y-leon-peoples-party-deal
3/11/2022,"Twitter has removed a post from the Russian embassy in London about the Mariupol hospital bombing which claimed the facility was no longer operational and that images had been faked, following criticism from Downing Street. No 10 accused the embassy of posting disinformation on Twitter after it posted pictures of the bombing emblazoned with the label “fake”. A series of follow-up tweets, including a claim that a victim of the bombing was “played” by a beauty blogger, have also been removed after Twitter said they “violated the Twitter rules”. The move came after a spokesman for Boris Johnson told reporters that the embassy was spreading disinformation. “It is clear that this is further disinformation. You have seen the pictures of the people who were wounded during that attack, and you have seen what the prime minister said in his tweet yesterday.” The spokesman said he was “not aware” that the Foreign Office had held “specific conversations” about reprimanding the embassy for the social media post. Asked whether Boris Johnson would like social media platforms to shut down the embassy’s accounts, the spokesman replied: “That’s obviously a matter for Twitter, but we’ve been clear that that is disinformation. You’ve seen the increase in the civilians that have been targeted and sadly wounded and killed on the basis of Russian attacks.” Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, accused the embassy of publishing fake news and said it had been reported to Twitter. The Russian embassy has swung behind the Kremlin’s messaging on the war, including publishing unsubstantiated claims on Wednesday that Ukrainians were planning “a provocation with toxins” in order to accuse Russia of using chemical weapons. Britain and the US fear Russia could be preparing to use a chemical weapon in Ukraine after Kremlin officials made separate allegations, without firm evidence, that the US had been supporting a bioweapons programme in Ukraine. It is understood that Twitter has ruled the “toxins” tweet does not breach its content guidelines. Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative journalism website Bellingcat, urged Twitter to “kick these propaganda-spewing accounts off” the platform on Thursday. He challenged the embassy’s tweets on the Mariupol hospital bombing, in which a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards was destroyed. The Russian embassy tweeted press pictures of the bombing, including that of an injured pregnant woman on the stairs, with the label “FAKE” emblazoned across the post. In a follow-up tweet, the embassy said a Ukrainian beauty blogger “played roles of both pregnant women” in photos it had highlighted, prompting Higgins to tweet that the blogger in question, Marianna Podgurskaya, had released pictures of her pregnancy on Instagram last month.

3/11/2022,"Ashuffling, brokendown Samuel L Jackson is quite a sight. In The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey (AppleTV+), he plays the eponymous Grey, a man suffering from rapidly progressing dementia, living in hermitic squalor despite the best efforts of his loving great-nephew Reggie (Omar Benson Miller), who is a last, fragile link with the outside world until he is killed in an unsolved shooting. And yet he holds your attention as firmly as he ever did as the biblically monologuing Jules in Pulp Fiction, or as Nick Fury in the MCU or – of course – as FBI agent Neville Flynn trying to keep track of all those snakes on that plane in 2006’s enduring masterpiece Snakes on a Plane. In his moments of lucidity Ptolemy is frightened of the ever changing world. In the rest he is distraught, burdened by unknown horrors and haunted by people and fragmented scenes from his childhood in the Jim Crow south. It is a rounded and unsparing portrait of dementia and to see the 73-year-old actor offer up such a vulnerable performance after a career largely built on dazzling us with the opposite adds a poignancy all of its own. Jackson’s portrayal of a man whose life is fading away from him is one of two reasons to stick with The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey. The other is Ptolemy’s growing relationship with his niece’s best friend’s daughter Robyn (on a good day he remembers all of this), who gradually comes to take Reggie’s place. What she lacks in initial tenderness she more than makes up for in her ability to tackle his disgusting bathroom and blocked toilet. Greater love hath no one. Robyn is played by Dominique Fishback, who is simply astonishing. Going toe-to-toe with Jackson in her first main television role, hers is a mesmerising and complex depiction of a young woman hardened by a tough start in life – and with the hair-trigger fighting instincts to prove it – who nevertheless cares for the old man, to whom she is no actual relation, and who is able to blossom in her own way under his attention. This core relationship and the pair’s evolving dynamic is what, I suspect, will keep most people watching while Plot with a capital P starts to billow round them. Ptolemy signs up to an experimental treatment invented and administered by a pushy research doctor (Walton Goggins) – a kind of limited Limitless pill that will restore him to himself but only briefly and leave him worse off thereafter. As it kicks in, it allows Ptolemy to become the charismatic raconteur he once was (and Jackson to bust out his more typical moves) while piecing together and coming to terms with his traumatic past, which includes witnessing the lynching of his uncle and mentor Coydog McCann (Damon Gupton), investigating Reggie’s murder, tracing the stolen treasure for which his uncle was killed. Throughout, he fends off family members and officials who seek to spoil and sever his and Robyn’s friendship. It’s a lot – although the magical pill aspect is at least not dwelt on too heavily and allowed to add a full sci-fi vibe to the brew as well – and not all of it is worth it. There are some very extraneous bits indeed, such as the local drug addict who tries to attack Ptolemy every time he leaves his house. She seems to be there to do nothing but help explain his isolation before Robyn comes along and to add tension to various scenes. The conclusion – Ptolemy redeemed, Robyn’s self-image remade, the good generally ending happily, the bad unhappily – is unremarkable and clearly destined pretty much from the opening episode. It feels like there is a better, shorter story here, stripped of the schmaltz that, however hard they try to banish hit, seems to creep inevitably into American tales of friendship (especially between young and old) and any wrestling with the indignities of age. It would benefit from focusing more tightly on the two main characters and the realities of their lives separately and together. But it is in many ways a career-best performance from Jackson (and from Fishback, though we must hope that hers is merely the first of many to come), and there is joy to seeing it in what must have been a passion project for him, as a longtime supporter of Alzheimer’s charities. He executive produces and has had the rights to the Walter Mosley book the series is based on for nearly a decade.

3/11/2022,"Dramatic drone footage emerged on Thursday of a Ukrainian ambush on a Russian armoured column just outside Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv. Bellingcat, the specialist open source investigator, said it had geolocated the video, to a lightly inhabited area on the E95 road about 35km (22 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, a direct route to the east of the capital where Russian forces have been trying to mass. The edited 45-second video, released by Ukraine’s armed forces, is a montage of the fighting on the road, which shows a company or more of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles coming under repeated attack. Its production quality means the fighting filmed may not have taken place on Thursday. It is overlaid with an audio of what appears to be a Russian officer reporting an attack to his superiors, which is presented as an effective commentary on the fighting shown. It also says the regiment’s commander was killed, named by Ukrainian media as Col Andrei Zakharov, although this could not be independently confirmed. “Sixth regiment lost,” the officer tells headquarters. “I cannot report about the 6th regiment. I’m collecting data. Lots of losses. They waited for us. Head of the convoy got into the ambush. Regiment commander killed in action.” Several military experts described the video as credible and said it showed surprising tactics on the part of the Russian forces, with more than 20 tanks and other armoured vehicles on a main road fairly close to the capital. Ben Barry, a former tank commander with the British army and a land warfare specialist with the thinktank IISS, said: “They either think they are going through a safe area, or they were not well trained or they are moving fast for some other requirement.” Tanks moving through a built-up area should normally use close infantry support to prevent ambushes from the side of the road, Barry said. Having watched the footage, he said he thought the Russian armour was probably targeted with artillery or mortar fire because the nature of the blasts. On the audio, the Russian apparently reporting the ambush speculates that they may been targeted by Turkish Bayraktar drones, but parts of the video show poor conditions and low cloud cover not considered ideal for drone attacks. Parts of the footage also show a TOS-1 heavy flamethrower, clearly marked with a painted O symbol, towards the bottom of the screen. At one point during the fighting it unleashes an incendiary rocket at a target apparently off screen, a demonstration of Russian willingness to use thermobaric weapons during combat. Another expert on the Russian military who reviewed the video, Rob Lee, a former US marine and PhD student at King’s College London, said he thought this displayed “very poor tactics” on the part of the Russians, with a force clearly positioned “on an obvious avenue of approach”.",News/World news,Drone footage shows ambush of Russian tanks by Ukrainian forces,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/drone-footage-russia-tanks-ambushed-ukraine-forces-kyiv-war
3/11/2022,"Pollution washed into Sydney’s beaches and waterways could linger for days, with state authorities urging swimmers to exercise caution after the flood disaster. Sydney Harbour turned brown as a result of storm water carrying soil and debris, and algal blooms have appeared on the usually pristine sands of Hyams beach in the Jervis Bay region. Rainfall is the major driver of pollution into coastal areas because it generates storm water and triggers the overflow of raw sewage into waterways. Flood waters, sediment and debris are behind the murky colour of many waterways along the New South Wales coastline and the viruses and bacteria carried by untreated sewage can pose a health risk to swimmers. “It’s not just the local stormwater that’s polluting our beaches, but it’s the murky water from the flood-affected inland areas,” said Meredith Campey, the manager of the NSW government’s Beachwatch program, which provides pollution forecasts. “It’s flowing downstream into the ocean.” Campey said the greatest effects were on estuaries where storm water was discharging into the ocean and where there were lower levels of flushing. “Places like Pittwater, Sydney Harbour, Botany Bay,” she said. “So it takes longer to recover from the storm water events.” Swimmers are typically advised to avoid swimming in ocean beaches for one day after rainfall, and for three days in harbours and enclosed bays. But given the scale of the flood disaster, Campey said the dangers could linger for longer, noting that flood waters were still making their way through river systems. Swimming in waterways affected by storm water can expose swimmers to pathogens that can lead to illnesses such as gastroenteritis, and ear and skin infections. Beachwatch routinely collects water samples from Sydney’s beaches and estuarine swimming sites, including Sydney Harbour, and tests for bacteria as an indicator of faecal contamination. Recent results have contained elevated microbial levels, showing the effects of storm water pollution and indicating the water is not suitable for swimming in. There is also a risk of injury from hidden objects and debris submerged in the water, such as furniture or trees. “So before you go for a swim, we’d always say to check for signs of pollution such as the flowing drains, discoloured waters, odours and floating debris,” Campey said. Daily beach pollution forecasts are also available on the Beachwatch website. The director of the graduate school of engineering at the University of New South Wales, Stuart Khan, said the colour of the water in places such as Sydney Harbour was largely due to soil and debris in the water. “One of the reasons it looks particularly bad now is because the degree of flooding would have caused a lot of erosion in gardens and parks,” Khan said. He said given flood waters were still making their way down rivers such as the Hawkesbury, there would be some places that would take a while to clear up. “I would be wary until it’s visually clear,” he said. “The recommendation is usually three days but if it’s still brown after a week I wouldn’t be swimming in it.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW environment department’s director of water, wetlands and coast, Peter Scanes, said fine particles could stay suspended in waterways for a week or longer. Scanes said this would reduce the available light, creating stress for seagrasses, seaweeds and kelps, which provide important habitat. The arrival of fresh water into salt water systems would also create problems for some marine species. “Our marine fish and our estuarine fish, they don’t like to be in freshwater,” he said. “At the moment, the fresh water in the Hawkesbury and probably in Sydney Harbour has pushed out all the salt water at least on the surface.” He said some species will have sought refuge at the bottom of waterways, where the water will still be salty. Others will have been forced to move elsewhere. Scanes said freshwater fish would also be seeking refuge because soils and sediment could irritate their gills, and in places away from the main flow of flood waters “So that they don’t get swept away … they can keep their energy by hiding behind rocks and logs and in backwaters,” he said.",News/Australia news,Sydney Harbour turns brown as authorities warn against swimming after floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/sydney-harbour-turns-brown-as-authorities-warn-against-swimming-after-floods
3/11/2022,"Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines would “inevitably” be forced into an emergency reactor shutdown by swarms of jellyfish if the fleet was based in Brisbane, a leading marine scientist says. The Australian government this week released a shortlist of three sites – Brisbane, Newcastle and Wollongong – as a potential east-coast home port for the nuclear submarine fleet, which will arrive in about 2036 under the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK. The Queensland government has been cagey when asked whether it supports a base in Brisbane, a position described as “very strange” by the federal defence minister, Peter Dutton, whose electorate is in Brisbane. “There are many thousands of jobs that are associated with such a facility,” Dutton said last week. “You’ve got to make judgments about whether there’s capacity within a particular port structure to accommodate that additional work.” Jellyfish expert Lisa-ann Gershwin, a leading marine biologist, says Brisbane is “close to the absolute worst place” for a nuclear submarine base, due to the conditions in Moreton Bay and the frequent jellyfish blooms. In 2006, the US nuclear-powered supercarrier USS Ronald Reagan was forced into an emergency reactor shutdown in Brisbane after it sucked more than 800kg of jellyfish into its condensers, hindering coolant from reaching the main reactors. “Picture if you will America’s biggest, most expensive, most fearsome, awesome supercarrier is on its maiden voyage,” Gershwin said. “It comes into the port of Brisbane and it sucks in thousands of jellyfish. It was a very embarrassing situation for the American navy. Luckily there was no major accident, nothing happened, nothing exploded. “But when you’re dealing with nuclear anything, you’ve got to be [more cautious].” The phenomenon of jellyfish shutdowns is surprisingly common in any power plant that sucks in water as a coolant. Gershwin says any base for a submarine with an in-built nuclear reactor could not be enclosed like Moreton Bay, which is sheltered by Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island. “Jellyfish act like plastic,” Gershwin said. “If you’ve ever seen a pool filter that’s got a plastic wrapper caught, it clogs up … and floods all over the place because it’s not going through the filter. The water gets stopped by this ‘plastic’ and then the water can’t pass by that. Emergency shutdowns of power plants happen all the time, very frequently.” Gershwin said that if Brisbane was used to base nuclear submarines, a jellyfish shutdown would be “inevitable”. “There aren’t many things as a scientist that I would say are inevitable, but this is. I couldn’t tell you what day or time it would happen, but I can tell you it would happen. “You’ve got to be really careful about where you put these things. Anywhere that you’ve got warm water, you’re going to have jellyfish. Moreton Bay is just sucked in with jellyfish.” Brisbane ranked eighth of the sites considered by Defence as a potential submarine base in 2011, with Sydney listed as the best choice. Defence was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,"Jellyfish would ‘inevitably’ force nuclear submarines into shutdown if based in Brisbane, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/jellyfish-nuclear-submarine-emergency-reactor-shutdown-brisbane-base-moreton-bay-australia
3/11/2022,"Volunteer housing worker Lucy Andrews is sitting on the couch of her Mullumbimby home, scrolling through rows and rows of names on her computer. “Everything that’s not highlighted are cases that haven’t been housed yet,” she tells the Guardian. “Or who are only in temporary housing and require permanent housing solutions.” For the past week, Andrews and two other women, volunteers with social work experience, have been doing all they can to ease the vast crisis in emergency accommodation in their corner of the flood-ravaged northern rivers region of New South Wales. Their work began last Tuesday, when one of the women sat down on the steps of Mullumbimby’s civic hall with a notepad and phone, and began offering assistance to anyone who needed emergency housing. She was soon joined by another former social worker and Andrews, who sat at a trestle table from 8am to 8pm, each day, creating spreadsheets of the displaced and homeless, triaging them and trying to link them up with safe, appropriate accommodation. They’ve helped between 200 and 300 people find emergency housing. “That’s the elderly, the young, parents, pregnant women. Given it’s Mullum, a lot of people who are not registered anywhere, they haven’t been paying rent anywhere,” she says. The early work was done without funding, resources, or organisational structure. Now, they’re working out of an office of the Mullumbimby neighbourhood centre on donated laptops. A piece of A4 paper has been Blu-Tacked to the door to a small room, housing a single volunteer. It reads “accommodation hub”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The volunteers, burnt out, are hoping someone can take over their work. But, until then, the scale of the problem remains immense. “The situation is ongoing and there’s no end in sight, right now, because there’s no one for us to hand over to, apart from other volunteers,” Andrews says. The problem in Mullumbimby is replicated all over the northern rivers. Hundreds are still stuck in evacuation centres. Others are sleeping on couches, in garages or at homeless shelters in places like Byron Bay. On Andrews’ street alone, four of the houses have taken in displaced people. Government data suggests that, of the 9,200 homes assessed in the northern rivers, 5,500 are damaged and 2,834 are not habitable. There are an estimated 1,234 people in temporary and emergency accommodation. On Thursday, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced a $551m package, funded jointly by the state and federal governments, to attempt to address the crisis. It included $248m for 16 weeks of rental support, including $6,000 payments for single person households and $18,000 for larger families. The government will spend $20m to give affected residents “pods” to live in on their land while rebuilding, and is providing $10m to supply temporary accommodation through mobile motor homes. The government has also hired temporary housing at camping sites in the northern rivers, giving capacity for 270 people. “We believe this is the support that will help people get through,” Perrottet said. “We want people out of evacuation centres. We want people who have gone through the trauma and are unable to return home to get into accommodation.” The region had been gripped by a housing crisis even before the floods. Private rentals were hard to find, and those that were available were exorbitant. Social housing was even more limited. There’s been significant pressure on Airbnb to do more to offer up its properties – it is linked to 6,260 homes in the region, most of which are available to tourists for most of the year – and the company announced unspecified plans to provide free short-term accommodation for flood-affected residents on Thursday. It’s an understatement to say the floods have compounded the problem, even in ways not immediately apparent. Andrews, for example, has been served an eviction notice telling her she must leave her Mullumbimby rental. The landlord lost his property in the floods and needs the house back.

Put people up in hotels in the short term, while they try to work out how to get back on their feet. “I don’t really see another option, because we’ve run out of options here, in the short term.” Even in Byron Bay, which wasn’t flooded, homelessness charities are already feeling the impact. The Uniting Byron Bay minister, the Rev Phil Dokmanovic, runs a service for those sleeping rough, opening up the church building during wet and extreme weather. Stretchers are set up in the church. In the past week, they’ve been taking in people displaced by the floods. “On Sunday, we had our worship gathering and we sort of set up chairs among the stretchers, and had our normal gathering, then packed things up and it resumed being a shelter,” he says. Dokmanovic has been working in places like Mullumbimby. He says it is clear that the floods will exacerbate the existing problems. “I would say without a doubt there is a huge shortage of accommodation as it is, and then you take out all these homes that are now unavailable for people to live in, and it’s only going to be worse.”",News/Australia news,‘We’ve run out of options here’: NSW flood disaster worsens housing crisis in northern rivers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/weve-run-out-of-options-here-nsw-flood-disaster-worsens-housing-crisis-in-northern-rivers
3/11/2022,"Until Saturday morning I thought that waking up sitting bolt upright was something that only happened in the movies. Then my clock radio told me Shane Warne was dead. The shock didn’t last too long. A heart attack in a Thai villa was an incredibly Shane Warne way to go, after all. When the news ended, I sat there in the dark thinking about his kids and Simone, the Gatting ball, every summer of my childhood, hair loss products, Hawaiian pizza, the relentless march of time, Liz Hurley, the phrase “bowling Shane” and my own fruitless attempts to bowl a single leggy that actually turned for the Drummoyne public school B team. Finally I was left with a sense of dread that if I went on social media, the sadness would be compounded by someone dragging up every unsavoury thing he ever did to make a point. (I’m aware that getting pre-emptively mad about an opinion you haven’t even seen is probably a symptom of some sort of pathology. It’s definitely a sign of spending too much time online. But we all do that, so we may as well talk about it.) In any case, I stayed away until the next day, at which point I logged on and saw exactly what I feared/desired: a bunch of people saying we should remember Warne as a sexual predator, among other things. These takes were couched in the language of nuance, the idea that they were bringing balance to an otherwise uncritical outpouring of adoration. The fact that every obituary of the man covered his missteps mattered not at all. It wasn’t the arguments themselves that annoyed me – though I think it’s a huge leap to conflate “bad husband” with “misogynist”. Nor, as a rule, do I think there’s anything wrong with speaking ill of the dead, though waiting until the body is cold is usually tasteful. What got to me was the all-too-familiar tone. The rush to label. The total lack of forgiveness. The terrifying idea that a person’s whole life should be defined by the worst things they ever said or did: a standard none of us would want applied to ourselves. A standard that, if broadly applied, would make for a miserable, unworkable society. It’s reassuring that this position was only held by a small minority. On Facebook and Instagram it seemed most of Australia had a story about meeting Warnie, how glad he had been to make their day, and how sad they were that he was gone. That wasn’t because they ignored his flaws. It was because they made the calculation that, on balance, he brought them joy. That his sins, whatever they were, were forgivable. And that felt good. We forgave him because we loved him, but we also loved him because we forgave him. Just one of the dozens of times Warne embarrassed himself in the national spotlight could have caused any of us to either spontaneously combust or not sleep for the rest of our lives. If he could survive telling the press that his mum gave him diuretics or the world reading his horny DMs, surely we could survive our memories of hurting others or singing No Woman No Cry in a Jamaican accent in year 7 music (just one example, many such cases). That he was allowed to keep doing his thing was oddly comforting. Yes, the reason Warne got away with being boorish and cringey was that he was the greatest dude ever to throw a spinning red leather ball. And it didn’t hurt that he was white and rich and male. But instead of using him as an example of how we should hold everyone to ever-higher standards, maybe we should note how good it felt to give him the benefit of the doubt and widen the circle of people we think are worthy of being seen as “complex”. That doesn’t mean automatically letting people off the hook or giving them a licence for bad behaviour. It means acknowledging that though some of us can bowl better leg breaks than others, we’re all just apes with smartphones, making mistakes and trying to be happy.

3/11/2022,"Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, says it may be possible for Australia to achieve a diplomatic thaw with China despite the substantial differences between the two countries – if Scott Morrison abandons his “desperate” pre-election weaponisation of national security. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, this week met China’s new ambassador to Australia who has made several overtures for dialogue since arriving in Canberra in January. Subsequently, the shadow minister told the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast that diplomatic engagement was important. Wong said if Labor won the federal election in May, Australia would not be taking “a backward step” on any substantive points of disagreement with Beijing. “We won’t be abandoning the positions that cause China concern – Australia’s position on the South China Sea, Australia’s right to determine who builds its 5G network and who is part of the NBN,” Wong said. “We’re not going to abandon our position on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea or human rights or foreign interference.” But, she added: “What we wouldn’t do is play domestic politics with the China relationship.” “I’ve not seen [a prime minister] use terms like Manchurian candidate, or Beijing’s preferred candidate, ever,” Wong said. “It is it is a demonstration of the extent to which Scott Morrison is desperate, but it is also a trashing of Australia’s national interests because one of the things that makes us strongest is our unity.” Wong said the relationship with Australia’s largest trading partner was “complex and challenging and difficult” and is “only made harder, by the playing of domestic politics with that”. Payne met China’s new ambassador, Xiao Qian, in Sydney on Wednesday. It is understood there was no diplomatic breakthrough in the meeting. Although it is standard for the minister to meet with a newly arrived ambassador, it is believed to be the highest level contact between the two countries since Payne spoke with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, two years ago. A spokesperson for Payne said Australia was “committed to a constructive relationship with China in which we can pursue areas of cooperation, while remaining consistent with our own national sovereign interests and focused on stability”. “The minister for foreign affairs set out frankly Australia’s positions on a range of issues, including the importance of appropriate ministerial and other high level dialogue and engagement, stability in the Indo-Pacific, free and open trade, human rights and the welfare of Australians detained in China,” the spokesperson said. “She also articulated Australia’s expectation that China use its influence to encourage and advise Russia to end the illegal invasion of Ukraine.” Xiao, who was previously China’s ambassador to Indonesia, said last month that China was “willing to work with Australia to meet each other halfway”. He said the two governments should “jointly make efforts” to push the relationship back on “the right track”. While Xiao did not specify any tangible actions Beijing may take, he said: “The diplomatic channel is open.” Australian ministers have complained since early 2020 they have been unable to secure phone calls or meetings with their direct counterparts in China – although contact has continued to occur at lower diplomatic levels. The Australian government accused Beijing of engaging in “economic coercion” by hitting a range of Australian export sectors with tariffs, bans or other sanctions in 2020 – some of which are being challenged at the World Trade Organization. China accuses Australia of being increasingly hostile to Chinese investment, including through the ban on Chinese telco Huawei’s involvement in the 5G network. Both major political parties in Australia view the differences in the relationship as largely structural and therefore not something that can be fixed by adopting a different tone. China is particularly sensitive to criticism about human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and Australia’s longstanding position against using force or the threat of force to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its criticism of new or renewed groupings such as the Quad and Aukus. Still, Xiao’s comments signalled a more open approach to dialogue, and contrasted with a warning from his predecessor, Cheng Jingye, in April last year that Beijing would respond “in kind” if Australia followed other countries in imposing sanctions against its officials over human rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning China’s diplomatic tactics have previously backfired. The embassy was rebuked by both sides of Australian politics in late 2020, after the release of a list of 14 areas of disagreement with Australia. The one-page document did not have a title but became known as a “list of grievances”, and it was reported that China was seeking concessions on those points in order to resume dialogue. The list included “outrageous condemnation of the governing party of China by MPs” and “unfriendly or antagonistic” reporting on China by Australian media outlets. Morrison showed the list to his international counterparts to make the case that Beijing was demanding policy changes that no liberal democratic government could accept. Tensions flared again last month after Morrison accused China of a dangerous “act of intimidation” over a Chinese warship’s shining of a laser at a RAAF surveillance plane north of Australia. China’s national defence ministry, in turn, accused the Australian defence force of “spiteful and provocative actions”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, said on Thursday it would be wrong to assume president Xi Jinping’s ambitions were “restricted just to Taiwan”, as the Australian government announced plans for a major expansion of the Australian defence force over the coming two decades. China’s embassy was contacted for comment on the meeting with Payne.

3/11/2022,"More than $13m has been donated to support those affected by the devastating floods in Queensland and New South Wales, and most of the money has been directed towards peer-to-peer fundraising efforts such as GoFundMe. Many of those crowdfunding campaigns have been set up by people living in the flooded regions to cover urgent costs and fund relief and rescue efforts, including more than $20,000 raised to run a rescue helicopter. Since 24 February, more than $9.6m has been donated across 1,700 fundraisers on the peer to peer platform GoFundMe. About 22% of all donations has been directed towards fundraisers based in the NSW northern rivers region. In Mullumbimby alone, 50 different campaigns have raised a total of $400,000. One fundraiser, which aimed to deliver food to those affected by the floods across the region, raised $173,834 before turning off donations – far outstripping its fundraising goal of $5,000. But as the waters begin to subside and formal relief agencies move in to begin the long process of helping communities recover, those community-run efforts are being replaced by formal charities. As of 9 March, the Red Cross Queensland and NSW flood appeal has raised $3.86m, and St Vincent de Paul has raised $162,000. The Salvation Army, which is aiming to raise $10m for flood relief, has repurposed $1m of funds from its Red Shield Appeal to begin initial recovery efforts. So what should you do if you want to help? Flood-affected communities have been overwhelmed with donations of goods, clothes and non-perishable foods. These items are vital in the first few days following a disaster but they are also bulky and difficult to store and distribute, and it is a lot of work for volunteers to check every item to make sure it is in good condition. In almost every case, money is a more useful donation than goods. If you do have particular goods to donate, it’s good practice to call ahead and check that the community or charity is happy to receive them. Crowdfunding is a great way to ensure funds are directed to a specific person, purpose or community, provided the campaign has been verified. GoFundMe says it verifies fundraising campaigns published on its site and will not release funds raised on behalf of another person until the intended recipient has signed on as a party to the campaign and their identity has been verified. But crowdfunded campaigns are not subject to the same levels of compliance checks and reporting requirements as formal charities. “Charities are heavily regulated and we have to adhere to a whole lot of different regulations and compliance requirements, which is part of being a charity,” Red Cross’s head of fundraising, Vanessa Byrne, said. “And for us when we launch an appeal our focus is always to ensure … we allocate the money where it is needed the most.” After the 2019-2020 bushfires, the Fundraising Institute of Australia issued a new practice note to set out the minimum standards for charities that are fundraising in times of disaster. It sets out regular, transparent reporting of the funds raised and dispersed. Registered charities are audited and required to produce regular reports on how funding from particular appeals has been used. “Transparency is so very important to us,” said Major Bruce Harmer, from the Salvation Army. “I think it’s important that the Australian public have confidence in the Salvation Army, not just in doing the work, but in reporting back and saying this is what we did on your behalf and thank you, so much, on behalf of the people we’ve been able to support with the funds that you’ve donated.” Byrne encourages people who are thinking of donating to research the organisation or fundraiser first. “People should make sure they have a look at what the organisation is saying the intention of their appeal is, and if somebody is still not sure about the information they have read, then call the charity and ask for more information,” she said. The Salvation Army has been running evacuation centres in Lismore, helmed by the heads of the Salvation Army northern rivers branch, Philip and Donna Sutcliffe. As of 10 March, they have provided 40,000 meals and issued 1,109 recovery grants – quick payments of $160 per adult and $60 per child issued on a debit card. Applications for both the recovery payments and for larger grants can be made at local recovery hubs. Those cash grants will be supported by wraparound services, which are ongoing. “What organisations like the Salvation Army are looking for is the opportunity not just to do a transaction and give people some money and say ‘we hope you’re OK’, we certainly do do that, but we also do wraparound services that stay with those people for years to come,” Harmer said. “We still have out in the field people working with those affected by the bushfires in 2019-20. They have now been repurposed for flood support … but they will be going back to those communities.” The Red Cross has 550 staff and volunteers across Queensland and northern NSW working on the flood response, and is running 24 evacuation centres which have housed more than 11,000 people. Thirteen of those centres are in the northern rivers. It is also running the register find unite service, which enables people missing in the floods to register themselves as safe. “Our focus is always on making sure that as needs arise during and after a disaster that we’re allocating the money where it’s needed the most. “",News/Australia news,Queensland and NSW floods: what you can do to help affected communities,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/queensland-and-nsw-floods-what-you-can-do-to-help-affected-communities
3/11/2022,"From the moment they met to their final days in hospital together, Jeannette and Michael Ryan’s relationship was a love story. For six decades they were dedicated to each other, and both tested positive to Covid-19 on New Year’s Eve. They were admitted to hospital in the regional Victorian city of Shepparton 10 days later. Michael was 84 years of age when he passed away on 15 January. His wife followed him exactly a week later, aged 82. Their four children, Olivia, Joanne, Mike and Damien, say their deaths were “sad, but not tragic”, because they can’t imagine how either of them would have endured life without the other. Mike says his mother, a practising nurse before she retired, used to rise at 5.30am for a 7am start. “Dad used to get up with her, make her breakfast, and go out every morning and get in the old Galaxy,” he says. “It was always hard to start when it was cold, so he would turn on the heating and warm it up so she wouldn’t be getting into a freezing car. He’d do that every morning.” The family don’t know where the couple acquired the virus – they became ill sometime in the busy holiday period when Covid cases spiked across much of the country. They’re just glad they managed to spend one last Christmas together. Jeannette Ryan (nee Davis) was born in 1939 in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. A passionate musician, she won a scholarship to attend the Conservatory of Music, but money was tight so she entered the workforce as a nurse instead. In 1961, Jeannette met her future husband working in the ICU department at St Vincent’s Hospital. Michael was being treated for a broken nose after an ice skating incident. He wrote later, in a poem he titled “Jeannette”: She walked into my life one day In nineteen sixty one. I, the patient in the bed, She the ray of sun. The uniform was crisp and trim, The nurse’s cap so neat, She moved with grace and confidence On those tiny little feet. My heart was lost I must admit. It was true love at first sight. I hadn’t thought it possible That this feeling could be right. When she came towards me I knew she was the one. The first words that she said to me were “Your gown’s on back to front.” Michael was smitten, but Jeannette needed a little more convincing. Their daughter, Joanne says in the early days, her dad would finish work on his family’s farm in little town of Dookie at 6pm and drive two-and-a-half hours down to Melbourne to pick Jeannette up from her shift the same evening. Two years later, they were married, and moved to Dookie in 1964, where they would live out the rest of their lives together. Michael’s family had farmed in the sweltering Goulburn Valley town since the 1850s. Dookie is now home to a small community of creatives, welders and horticulturalists, but in Michael’s day, life consisted of working on the farm and in his family’s equipment business. When Jeannette arrived, she progressed up the ranks in nursing, while Michael ran the farm by day and the Hy-Tone cleaning company at night. Times were tough – the couple endured drought, financial hardship and declining sheep and wheat prices. But Michael was ahead of his time as a farmer. He was the first in the region to work at night, putting lights on his tractors and harvesters. In the late 70s, he turned to soil conservation and was a pioneer in salinity control. He was also deeply creative. His daughter Olivia says they called him the “plowing poet”, as he’d often recite and write poems while driving his tractor – or, as he called it, “spinning ever decreasing circles in the paddock”. “He’d get an inspiration while he was going around the paddock and just stop the tractor and write stuff down,” his daughter Joanne says. “He said anyone watching him would’ve thought he was insane. People didn’t realise how clever he was – he was essentially self taught in most things. He taught himself to play piano, he heard an opera piece over the radio one night and fell in love with opera, he subscribed to Time magazine and would read it from cover to cover.” His son Mike says his dad was the kind of father who would find time to clean and polish his children’s black leather school shoes despite working night and day. He has vivid memories of his dad spreading newspaper on the floor of the laundry, where he would kneel and scrub the shoes before lining them up in the hallway to be donned in the morning. “My entire life … I was always aware, even when I was a child, no one else’s father was like him in his dedication to us, and his sacrifice of almost everything else that he would do in his life to look after us,” Mike says. “I always thought if I did end up being 50% the man he was, then I would have done more than I ever thought I could.” Jeannette was just as devoted a mother and nurse. “She compared her success to a duck, swimming in the water – on the surface, it’s all calm and collected and beneath you’re pedalling like crazy,” Mike says. “Her attitude to life was to never give up, and try as hard as you can.” Shopping with Jeannette, her children say, was impossible because she couldn’t go into town without running into someone she knew, who would profusely thank her for the care she gave them or their family. “Mum was fierce and scary,” Joanne says. “But she was also kind and totally fair. With mum in your corner, you knew that you could not lose, she just would not allow that to happen. “[My parents] had unwavering faith in our abilities. Whenever we told them of our children’s achievements their standard answer was: ‘I knew they would’ or ‘of course they did’.” Jeannette’s nursing career, which spanned 57 years, eventually led to managerial roles at Goulburn Valley Health and regional Victorian aged care facilities. She may not have retired, aged 72, if she hadn’t been diagnosed with bowel cancer – which she went on to recover from. She’d probably be on the frontline of Covid, too, if not for her age and failing health. “[When Covid hit], she rattled off a whole list of things they had to do – set up people in isolation, put them in full PPE, she knew exactly how to do it,” Joanne says. Their children pushed the couple to protect themselves from the virus before the vaccine arrived, and only go into town for essential shopping. “They they begrudgingly listened to what we said and they agreed with it,” Joanne says. “But they knew that time was marching on for them. So they waited like we’d ask them to be vaccinated. They waited until they’d had the booster. And then their feelings were … ‘We need to see our family. We are getting older and we are getting frailer. And we can’t wait any longer’.” Mike says Jeannette was adamant the family Christmas went ahead this year, “to the point where she was ringing me every day checking to see if we were coming for two weeks beforehand”. In the end, about a third of the family came down with the virus. In a seemingly arbitrary roll of the dice, Jeannette and Michael were among them. Jeannette lost her life just four days before she was named the City of Greater Shepparton Senior Citizen of the Year. Joanne accepted the award on behalf of her mother in front of a large crowd, with many of the Ryan family present. There were mixed emotions that day – grief and heartbreak, tangled up in pride. But despite the family’s profound loss, Joanne says what happened to her parents was the “kindest thing” if they were going to die of the virus. “I wouldn’t have wanted either of them to be as heartbroken [as] we are that they’re gone, and to have to cope without that person who’s been there for the past 60 years,” she says. “People think losing both is harder than losing one, but I don’t think it has been. It would have been so sad to watch one of them mourn the other.” Joanne would have loved her parents to “go on for ever and ever”, as would all of the family. They were the type of people “you just wanted to go and chat to – tell them what things you’re up to and what the kids were up to”. “But none of us wanted them to suffer,” she says. “They kept telling us at the end, how proud they were of all of us, how happy they were with what they’d achieved in their lives. “They really wanted us to know that there were no regrets – that they couldn’t have wanted for any more than what they had achieved.”",News/Australia news,‘One last Christmas’: after six decades together Covid claims husband and wife in same week,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/one-last-christmas-after-six-decades-together-covid-claims-husband-and-wife-in-same-week
3/11/2022,"Travellers are facing steep air fare hikes as bans on Russian oil cause jet fuel prices to surge, Australian aviation experts warn. Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has said the average fare would increase by 7% as a result of the increased crude oil prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but others predict the price rises could be higher. The Brent crude oil price sits at around US$112 a barrel, up from about US$78 a barrel at the beginning of 2022 and marking an eight-year high, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The surge follows the US and UK banning oil from Russia – the world’s biggest exporter of crude and oil products combined. For most airlines, fuel makes up 30% to 40% of operating costs. “You don’t have to be a maths expert to know that fuel costs going up by 20% to 30% will hurt a lot,” Prof Rico Merkert, chair of transport and supply chain management at the University of Sydney’s Business School, told Guardian Australia. If Europe follows the US’s tough stance on Russian oil, prices may be pushed higher than $200 a barrel, says Merkert. “This would be catastrophic for airlines.” Speaking on Tuesday at the Australian Financial Review business summit, Joyce said airlines had little choice. “Unfortunately if [oil prices] stay at these levels, air fares are going to have to go up,” Joyce said. “7% is not massive, but … I think it will have some impact on the levels of travel out there.” Motorists are feeling the impact too, with economists predicting prices for petrol will jump to as much as $2.50 a litre. Ravi Kumar, director of Continental Travels Australia, said in the past, air fare prices have increased between 2% and 5%. The higher the expected increase, the more important it is for consumers to act fast and purchase tickets for travel. Over the last few days, Kumar has observed increases of up to $100 on ticket prices. “Generally we recommend consumers buy tickets early when there is an expected increase in prices,” he said. “We don’t know if it will be a minor increase, or grow to a major increase, but we can expect some jump.” Tom Manwaring, chair of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, said ticket prices were “coming off a very low base”. “Air fares were already very, very cheap. So now they’ll just be very cheap.” He suggested growing confidence in the market among consumers was the main driver of prices at the moment. Manwaring said Australians planning a trip towards the end of 2022, or early 2023, did not have to hurry to get tickets now. Coming out of Covid, he said most airlines were still operating at severely reduced capacity. “Most airlines are currently operating at 10% to 25% of their capacity.” Over the next six to nine months, he expects international carriers will build up capacity, meaning more seats would become available. “Competition between airlines as that happens will help level prices back out.” Merkert said the oil price surge was an “unfortunately timed spanner in the works” for the airline industry as it recovers from Covid border closures. The March 2022 ACCC report found consumers’ intention to travel domestically over summer had dropped “by 10 percentage points” compared to December 2021. The report attributed a key driver of the decline to consumer concern about contracting Covid – a “different challenge” to the prolonged movement restrictions that characterised the pandemic earlier. It also noted that volatility in jet fuel prices “will add further pressure to airlines’ costs amid the pandemic”. An ACCC spokesperson told Guardian Australia: “air fares often reflect consumers’ willingness to pay, or the level of airline competition, more than the underlying costs of providing the service. “However, air fares may increase to some degree should high jet fuel prices remain,” the spokesperson said. “This may further hinder the industry’s recovery.” Airlines often enter hedging contracts based on expected future prices to protect from short-term fluctuations in jet fuel prices. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ACCC report, however, noted that the pandemic “has made this strategy somewhat ineffective”. “The uncertainty around flying activity has reduced the ability of airlines to accurately forecast fuel consumption volumes,” the report reads. Joyce said Qantas had hedged 90% of its fuel needs until the end of June, which will “give us time to react to that higher fuel price”. Merkert said smaller carriers or new airlines such as Bonza Airline that compete on cost were less likely to secure a hedging contract. “So when fuel goes up by 30% to 40%, costs compromised by fuel price becomes a big issue for them.”",News/Business,Turbulent times: Australian air fares predicted to soar as bans on Russian oil lift jet fuel prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/11/turbulent-times-australian-air-fares-predicted-to-soar-as-bans-on-russian-oil-lift-jet-fuel-prices
3/11/2022,"My dilemma lies with not knowing where I should be. I have moved between two cities during my 20s and feel as though I have strong communities in each place. While both offer beautiful friendships, experiences and feelings of home, both also (inevitably) have their drawbacks. One city is where I created a lot of independence away from family and friends and found new parts of myself. The other city is the one I grew up in, where my family and old friends live, where some of the deepest parts of me reside. I spend so much of my time in one city wishing I was in the other, and vice versa, never finding myself present to create a life in one place. How do I reconcile where I want to be? Eleanor says: As with so many life decisions, I think the key here is to stop trying to make the right one. That sounds counterintuitive – like what else could the goal be but to get our big decisions right? But sometimes chasing the best choice can undermine us. I like to think about a psychological experiment from researchers Daniel Gilbert and Jane Ebert. Here’s how it goes: undergraduates are taught how to take photographs. At the end of the semester they’re told they can select one of their pictures and the school will print it large enough to hang on the wall – it’s theirs to take home. Some students are told they have one shot to make the choice. Whatever they pick now is the one they’ll take home. Others are told they can change their minds for as long as they like, including after the print gets made. By far, the people who thought their decision was final wound up happier with the choice they’d made. It can be that way with places. You mention daydreaming about each place when you’re in the other – I think that’s a common experience for emigrants or people who split their time. And there, the choice isn’t something external like what to hang on a wall – it can feel like a choice about who to be. You’ll know the weird phenomenon where your personality shifts depending on where you are – I know someone who thinks he’s a nicer person in Spanish, someone who thinks he’s less neurotic in Australia. Each home brings out different parts of who we are, so when we daydream about the smells or rituals of each place I think we’re also daydreaming about the person it lets us become. No wonder it starts to feel each decision is one you’ll regret – how can you pick just one way to be? But there are two lies in that way of thinking. One is the phenomenon those students taught us: sometimes it’s the act of making the decision that makes you happy, not any belief about how it turned out. The students who turned out most content with their photograph didn’t get that way because they gave an affirmative answer to the question “did I make the best choice?”; it just didn’t occur to them to keep asking it. The other is the thought that you mention when you talk about where the “deepest parts” of you reside. The truth is that both parts of you – the independent part that set out on your own and the part that longs for your first home and friends and family – are all aspects of the same self. Different parts are more accessible in different places, but the fact you can access them at all tells you they’re enmeshed with who you are. In whichever home you choose, you’ll be the person who built both these lives – it’s like the more reassuring version of the adage “wherever I go, there I am”. So it won’t be the particulars of the place you settle in that make you feel you made the right choice. It’ll be the act of making the choice at all, and bringing as much of your whole self as you can to the place you decide to call home. Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with? Eleanor Gordon-Smith will help you think through life’s questions and puzzles, big and small. Questions can be anonymous.

3/11/2022,"A fashion show is carried off without a hitch. At a party, a “sound healing” happens. A feud exists, is discussed and then resolved. Someone is accused of buying Instagram followers. These are the events that happen during the first four episodes of Byron Baes – a spree of occurrences, almost too gentle to call a storyline, among a small friendship group and a handful of newcomers. Tensions are obsessed over by all involved, incurring a fascination for the viewer that’s hard to explain. At some points, the Netflix Australia show is recognisable reality TV, closer to the Housewives or The Hills franchises, full of strange rich people doing strange rich people things. At other times it’s more earnest, more meditative, like Terrace House – even like slow TV. The combination is a bit like watching a tank full of beautiful tropical fish – you know they’re not really going to do anything and they’ve got nowhere to go, but you’re still entranced by their bright colours. The reality show – or “docu-soap” as it prefers to be labelled – caused a storm of controversy ahead of its release, with Byron Bay locals putting together a petition to ban the show, and holding a mass boogie-board paddle-out in protest. Important points were made about glamorising the lives of the rich people who have moved to Byron and created a housing crisis, with fears that the show would encourage more of the same problems – problems that have only been exacerbated during the devastating floods that unfortunately coincided with the show’s launch. Even the cast had issues with its marketing, some taking offence at being described in a press release as “celebrity-adjacent-adjacent influencers”. Netflix ended up apologising to some cast members, and reframing how they were described: “They are artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, business owners, models, on a spiritual journey and more,” explained Netflix Australia’s director of original content, Que Minh Luu, on Twitter. But it’s this question of identity that creates the strange and compelling allure of Byron Baes – the show not merely a lens placed over this odd coastal NSW playground of the linen-clad rich, but a kind of terrifying Sauron’s eye, swivelling the world’s gaze and illuminating it, for better or, often, for much, much worse. The locals fear being perceived, while the cast seem to desire it, with the show itself forced to take a coy middle ground: are they zooming in on a bunch of shallow, crystal-loving brand influencers in an effort to entertain us with their vapid shenanigans? Or is it a kind of love letter to a unique part of the world? Is it reality TV or a docu-soap? What exactly is Byron Baes? After four episodes, it’s hard to tell exactly – but I can confirm it’s incredibly enjoyable and compulsive reality TV, the kind that leads to a long and comfortable binge. My partner said, somewhere after the second episode, “I hope they make a thousand seasons of this show.” It’s an elevation of the genre, creating interesting and fun television out of people’s lives, rather than relying on a flashy premise or turning the cast into a cheap gimmick. Also, the scenery is stunning; you can tell why the world’s rich and famous have gravitated to this town. Rather than featuring people who want to use reality TV as a gateway to the influencer industry, Byron Baes foregrounds those who already consider themselves influencers, or at least influencer-adjacent (or artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, business owners, models, on a spiritual journey and more, sorry). There’s none of that thin layer of pretence of being “here for the right reasons”. The cast is aware from the beginning that they are being watched by us – they have invited our scrutiny – which makes it even more delectable when they still manage to make themselves look shallow, vainglorious, superstitious and foolish. They asked for this. The show isn’t malicious; it actually treats the cast with a lot of love, and some of them do come across as lovable. Nevertheless, we are treated to glorious scenes like in episode two, when Instagram influencer Jade and brand-manager-on-a-spiritual-journey Hannah sit in a giant crystal geode and seriously discuss how it was millions of years old, like the “dragon bones” that scientists find out in the desert. In episode three, at a party, Jade tells talent manager Alex he’s “an actual fucking joke” after being accused of buying his Instagram followers. There’s drama, but the show isn’t entirely engineered as a pressure cooker for these confrontations to happen. You’re just as likely to watch some very beautiful people have a nice chat on the beach about art. Byron Baes is a window into a strange blister of privilege and elitism set in a beautiful location. It follows in the footsteps of shows like Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Real Housewives, where the joy is not so much about making fun of, or hating, or even loving the subjects – but just watching, and being fascinated by, their weird little lives.

3/11/2022,"On Wednesday’s Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined why the European Union would be unable to join a US boycott of Russian energy imports. “While America is able to go cold turkey on Russian oil, Europe is hooked,” he explained. The EU gets 40% of its gas and a quarter of its oil from Russia, “which is why they couldn’t join this boycott even if they wanted to.” The arrangement gives Russia leverage, and Vladimir Putin is using it by threatening to cut off Europe’s gas supply. “You see, you can’t go too hard after the country that makes it possible for you to survive winter,” Noah noted. “That’s why Europe always has to pepper its denunciations of Russia with like the occasional compliment – ‘this war in Ukraine is as inexcusable as Tchaikovsky’s music is unforgettable, huh?’” But it’s a two-way street, he continued. “Sure, Europe needs Russian oil, but Russia needs Europe’s money. I mean, what else do they have to offer? It’s not like they’re going to fund a war by selling cabbage soup.” “So both sides of this relationship are in a game of chicken and nobody knows who’s going to give,” he added. What is clear is that Europe and the US shouldn’t be in this situation in the first place. “Putin has shined a spotlight on the trade-offs that dependency on fossil fuels creates,” said Noah. “If countries want to move to renewable energy or safe nuclear power, they can no longer afford to make that, like, item number 10 on the agenda,” he concluded. “Because not only will the planet suffer, but you’ll find yourself constantly having to make deals with the devil.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers also tore into the devil’s bargain of US fossil fuel dependence. In response to Russia’s escalation of its invasion of Ukraine, Biden announced a ban on all Russian energy imports, “which might make this a good time to pause and acknowledge how insane it is that we continue to buy oil from brutal regimes like Russia and Saudi Arabia,” Meyers noted. The ban would only send the US to buy oil from other brutal dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, Meyers explained. “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could generate our own clean energy through renewable sources like wind and solar instead of begging murderous crazy people not to gouge us? Then at least we wouldn’t have to watch another US president hold a weird glowing orb or do a sword dance with Saudi royals like he’s auditioning for a non-flipping role in Cirque du Soleil,” he said over photos of Trump’s fawning visit to Saudi Arabia. Energy independence through domestic, renewable production would be “so much better for so many obvious reasons”, Meyers added, including the fact that it would take power away from repressive oil-based dictatorships. “Right now they have far too much power over both global and domestic politics,” he said, pointing to record-high gas prices. “The numbers are so shocking that I drove by a station that had ‘viewer discretion advised’ on the sign,” he quipped. But while some Republicans have blamed the prices on Biden, Meyers pointed to oil company profits, which surged to $174bn in 2021. “Maybe they could use some of that money to lower gas prices instead of stock buybacks or shooting glossy commercials full of healthy-looking sea turtles,” he said. And on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert took stock of Russia’s financial future after the credit rating agency Fitch downgraded Russian securities to a C rating. The change reflected their view that “a sovereign default is imminent”. “Russia is about to lose everything and crash with a buddy, I guess,” said Colbert. “Belarus better have a big couch, because without a credit rating, the only way they can pay their debt is by having a garage sale at Lenin’s tomb. Every pickled corpse must go.” As a new Iron Curtain appears evermore imminent, Russians are hoarding items from Ikea, H&M and Zara before they become “relics of a bygone era”, according to the Washington Post. “It’s amazing that they think anything from H&M will last long enough to become a relic,” joked Colbert. Several US companies are shutting down operations in the country, including McDonald’s. “And with the golden arches closing down, Russians are going to have to settle for their local chain: McDostoevsky’s, home of their kids meal, the Box of Sadness,” Colbert quipped. Coca-Cola and Pepsi also announced suspensions of business in Russia; Coke is suspending all operations, while PepsiCo said it would continue to sell potato chips and some daily essentials such as milk, cheese and baby formula. “To which Russian babies said: are you sure you don’t have Coke?” Colbert riffed.",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah: Putin has ‘shined a spotlight’ on fossil fuel dependency,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/10/trevor-noah-putin-oil-seth-meyers-stephen-colbert
