3/27/2022,"Three hundred babies died or were left brain-damaged due to inadequate care at an NHS trust, according to reports.The Sunday Times has reported that a five-year investigation will conclude next week that mothers were denied caesarean sections and forced to suffer traumatic births due to an alleged preoccupation with hitting “normal” birth targets.The inquiry, which analysed the experiences of 1,500 families at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital trust between 2000 and 2019, found that at least 12 mothers died while giving birth, and some families lost more than one child in separate incidents, the newspaper reported.Donna Ockenden, an expert midwife who led the inquiry with the input of more than 90 midwives and doctors, said her team had been “shocked and saddened” by the scale of the tragedy. The Ockenden report is expected to reveal that hundreds of babies were stillborn, died shortly after birth or were left permanently brain-damaged while many had fractured skulls or broken bones, or were left with life-changing disabilities. Ockenden, who has more than 30 years’ experience in maternity services, told the Sunday Times: “There were numerous opportunities for the system to wake up and realise that there was a problem at this trust. “There have been a number of occasions where families tried to be heard over many years and were silenced or ignored.“We have seen families that have been split apart, families where relationships have been broken, cases of trauma and PTSD that have persisted for years after the event as well as terrible, terrible sadness.“At times, after meeting families, I went back to my hotel room and I cried.”An NHS spokesperson said: “Our health service constantly strives to provide safe and compassionate maternity services while delivering 1,600 babies each day and we have already taken significant action to transform our care for pregnant women and their babies – with an additional £127m to boost the maternity workforce and improve workplace culture for our staff announced earlier this week.“This is on top of an additional £95m over the last year to establish 1,300 new maternity roles into the NHS alongside new training and leadership development programmes, and we have seen clear progress in improving outcomes and experiences for women and their families – but we recognise there is still progress to be made, and the NHS will be taking further action to ensure all women and babies are provided the best possible care.”Angela McConville, chief executive of the parenting and childbirth charity NCT, said the organisation had reviewed its antenatal courses in 2019 with a framework that covers “all ways of giving birth”. She added: “Our charity’s position today is to support parents to have the best possible experience of pregnancy, birth and early parenthood.“We are not here to give advice or to promote one way over another. We believe that safety for women and babies must be paramount.”",News/Society,"Shropshire maternity scandal: 300 babies died or left brain-damaged, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/26/shropshire-maternity-scandal-300-babies-died-or-left-brain-damaged-says-report
3/27/2022,"Luke Shaw credited Gareth Southgate with creating an atmosphere which allows England’s players to perform with smiles on their faces after they secured a 2-1 friendly victory over Switzerland. It was not a classic performance, but for the first time England have gone 21 games without defeat over 90 minutes and in World Cup year there is a feeling of momentum building. “For me it’s about enjoyment, playing games with a smile on my face,” said Shaw, who scored an equaliser in first-half stoppage time. “It’s always important to feel like you’re wanted. I’m not saying I don’t at Manchester United but especially here, the way things are, I feel wanted, I enjoy my football. The big part of football is enjoyment.” Shaw’s comments could be interpreted as criticism of the atmosphere at Old Trafford, and he admitted that “it’s hard to enjoy it when we’re losing and we’re not playing well at club level”. But they formed an interesting contrast with those of Conor Gallagher, whose performance on his first senior start was extremely encouraging. Though Gallagher’s forays forwards sometimes left England undermanned in midfield, Southgate’s priority had been making the player feel at ease by giving him the same role he has performed for Patrick Vieira at Crystal Palace this season. “I think the manager’s done that on purpose. I felt comfortable out there,” he said. “First half we found it quite difficult but I felt like second half it opened up a bit and we started to play better and create more chances.” The game changed after an hour, when Gallagher was withdrawn as England switched to a 4-2-3-1 formation that powered them through a much-improved final period and eventually, albeit courtesy of a controversial VAR penalty decision, to victory. “The system was to try to get the players in areas of the pitch where they’d be really comfortable,” Southgate said. “So Gallagher and Mason Mount, who we know press well [pushed forward]. I thought the front two [Harry Kane and Phil Foden] were a little too quick to press the centre-backs and it opened up too much space. It was a really good test. We fell behind, we had tactical problems to solve, we had to defend properly, and of course towards the end we were able to get more experience and some top players onto the pitch which made us finish strongly as well.” Kane’s penalty moved him level with Bobby Charlton in England’s scoring charts with 49, four behind Wayne Rooney’s all-time record. It was not the England captain’s finest performance, but once again England were grateful for his contribution. “He looks favourite to go on and break the record,” Southgate said. “I don’t want to put any curse on him but he wants the team to do well so he’s got this dual drive. That means there’s never a camp where it looks like he doesn’t want to be involved, and that mentality spreads through the rest of the group.” Kyle Walker-Peters and Marc Guéhi both made their senior debuts, with Tyrick Mitchell coming off the bench to do the same, and Southgate singled out Guéhi and his central defensive partner Ben White for praise. “I watch him play for Crystal Palace and sometimes he can go under the radar because he’s rarely out of position and he’s so calm, so you don’t see lunging tackles,” he said of Guehi. “But he played with that discipline and assurity, and I thought he was excellent. Ben made a small error for the goal but the rest of his game was very good, on and off the ball. I thought those two were real positives.”",Sport/Football,Luke Shaw: ‘It’s always important to feel wanted and I have that with England’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/26/luke-shaw-its-always-important-to-feel-wanted-and-i-have-that-with-england
3/27/2022,"The third Test in Grenada will reach its conclusion on the fourth day and what could easily prove Joe Root’s last as England captain following a batting collapse to top anything witnessed during his side’s winter of discontent. On a stirring third day at the National Cricket Stadium in St George’s, it was the unlikely right-arm medium of Kyle Mayers that re-opened the wounds inflicted by the more celebrated Australian attack in the Ashes, claiming remarkable figures of five for nine to leave West Indies within touching distance of a 1-0 series win. England have talked up their progress on this tour but will resume their third innings on 103 for eight and a lead of just 10 runs. They need the tail to wag for a second time in the match, much like it did for West Indies when Joshua Da Silva’s unbeaten 100 turned the tide in the morning and posted 297 all out for a lead of 93 runs. But, quite frankly, they look a beaten team. Root has dutifully soldiered on with the captaincy due to a lack of alternatives but after 64 Tests he will do well to recover from this performance. Certainly when he was one of three England batters to succumb to Mayers in a collapse of four for 39 after lunch, his backfoot punch edged to slip, he looked spent. The atmosphere was electric all day, the locals signing off from the working week, outnumbering the English for the first time in this series and watching West Indies follow Da Silva’s vigil with a rousing bowling performance that began when Zak Crawley recklessly drove the fired-up Jayden Seales to slip. When Mayers followed his second removal of Root in the match by bowling Dan Lawrence for a duck – the No 4 shouldering arms to one that nipped back in – and had Ben Stokes caught behind on four the ball after Alex Lees had been dropped at slip, the steel band could easily have panned out the Last Post. Not for the first time in the match, the softening of the Dukes ball brought with it a period of calm either side of tea. Lees shrugged off his life on nine and combined with Jonny Bairstow for 25 overs of resistance. But just when parity was in sight, Da Silva had a little word from behind the stumps to tell Bairstow, on 22 from 82 balls: “You’re batting slow now Jonny, like me.” The very next over Bairstow perished attempting to address this with a pull shot off Alzarri Joseph that was under-edged to the devil on his shoulder. Ben Foakes, fresh to the crease at the end of a low-key return this tour, then compounded the breakthrough further five balls later, recklessly run out by the golden arm of Mayers from long leg attempting a needless second run. Not done there, Mayers was then handed the ball by his captain and completed his maiden Test five-wicket haul when he bowled Lees for 31 with a grubber and then had Craig Overton caught at third slip. Chris Woakes, Jack Leach and Saqib Mahmood, the No 11, will need to put their superhero pants on first thing. This carnage had followed a morning from Hades for Root’s guileless attack, West Indies resuming on 232 for eight and turning a slender lead of 28 into a potentially decisive number through the gimlet-eyed determination of Da Silva (54 not out overnight) and a 10th-wicket stand of 53 with Seales. This was a day that Da Silva will never forget, the 23-year-old having shrugged off the pain of a blow to his hand from Chris Woakes and realised a dream first spawned when he was growing up in Port of Spain; as he slapped Craig Overton for back-to-back fours to bring up his century, the noise inside the National Cricket Stadium was akin to a calypso tent during carnival season. Da Silva could barely contain his emotion, tears flooding to the eyes of this deeply religious wicketkeeper-batter as looked to the heavens and Seales, his old teammate from Queens Park Cricket Club, slapped him on the back. “Thanks to God, my parents and everybody supporting me,” Da Silva told the broadcasters at the change of innings. “It means the world to me.” This emotion clearly got to Da Silva, who appeared to feather a catch down leg the very next delivery and walked off while making a cursory review. He had already crossed the rope and was back in the dressing room by the time it transpired there was no edge, with the crowd going berserk once more. There was no impact on the final total but the reprieve allowed Da Silva to register red ink next to his name, Root bringing himself on for the next over and instantly removing Seales with a smart caught and bowled. Less clever was the England captain’s use of the review system, which saw all three burned on day two and then punished on the third morning when the newly arrived Seales survived an lbw shout from Mahmood. The latest in a string of incorrect decisions during this series, it would have seen West Indies bowled out for 245 with a lead of 41 and Da Silva left high and dry on 65. As it was, the last wicket pairing chiselled away for another 23 maddening overs and West Indies batted 116.3 in all – the sixth time since the start of the Ashes that England have racked up triple-figures in the field. After the early removal of Kemar Roach by Mahmood for a gutsy 25, England were largely bereft of ideas and met two cussed batters in Da Silva and Seales, with the latter – first-class average of 3.3 – defending gutsily but also enjoying one moment of fun when he launched the ineffective Leach back for six. It may have felt like a low moment for England in a winter boasting a good few of them, but the worst was still to come.",Sport/Sport,Joe Root’s captaincy hangs by a thread as West Indies clobber England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/joe-roots-captaincy-hangs-by-a-thread-as-west-indies-clobber-england
3/27/2022,"Bill Sweeney, the Rugby Football Union chief executive, intends to appoint an English successor to Eddie Jones, in effect ruling out a move for a big-hitting overseas replacement such as Warren Gatland or Rassie Erasmus. Sweeney has given his backing to Jones – whose contract runs through to the 2023 World Cup – to continue despite a torrid Six Nations campaign and though the Australian’s position will be kept under constant review the RFU’s plan is to appoint his successor next summer. The new coach could even work under Jones at the World Cup in France before taking over. Sweeney also revealed the union has set up a “war room” to assess the credentials of all English coaches, working domestically and abroad. While Andy Farrell and Shaun Edwards fit into the latter category, a move for either coach appears difficult considering the intention is to make an appointment in the lead up to next year’s World Cup, when they will be immersed with Ireland and France respectively. The RFU’s criteria would best suit someone such as Steve Borthwick, formerly Jones’s assistant and the head coach at Leicester, who top the Premiership table. Erasmus has recently expressed interest in the role after next year’s World Cup and Gatland, the former Lions and Wales coach, is seen by many as the ideal candidate. Sweeney, however, explained that the RFU intends to take a homegrown route and that he had not approached the New Zealander about the job. “We believe we’ve got such a wealth of English coaches in the game,” said Sweeney. “As a leading rugby nation we should be developing English coaches and an English style of play. That should be long-term and therefore the preference would be to have an English setup as far as I’m concerned. We’ve got a war room that’s got every English coach you can imagine – based here and based internationally. We’ve got an advanced succession plan in place.” While Sweeney will ultimately be responsible for the appointment, the RFU’s performance director, Conor O’Shea, is working closely with Nigel Redman, the former Bath lock who has experience in coaching succession across Olympic sport. O’Shea cited how Fabien Galthié was named as Jacques Brunel’s successor in April 2019 and was on the France coaching staff the following month before taking over after the World Cup in Japan. “The plan for us will be to appoint that coach before summer 2023,” said O’Shea. “Whether that’s embedding them into the programme or taking a helicopter view, that’s a discussion to be had. We would like to think we will be appointing them in the lead up to 2023. We have so many top English coaches who are in a great position. Eddie has worked with Steve [Borthwick], Neal [Hatley], Gussy [Paul Gustard]. You look across the Premiership and then you see the quality of people overseas. I want them to be English and I believe [they] should be. “The rationale is we need to appoint so we have got time to embed the new coaching team and allow them to hit the ground running. Eddie is fully aware and knows what we want to do. There will be some people who say that will disturb the World Cup prep because people will be looking over their shoulder. Galthié was appointed before the 2019 World Cup and it’s the right thing to do because we need to get ready for the 2024 Six Nations.” Sweeney said that ideally Jones’s successor would be a less controversial figure, but denied suggestions Jones has entirely lost the support of England fans and defended his decision to release a book this year in which he openly criticised members of the squad, including Maro Itoje and Ollie Lawrence. Jones also wrote that Sweeney “has to trust me because, if you’ve never coached in elite sport before, how can you tell a head coach he’s wrong? It would be the height of arrogance.” Sweeney said: “If you could create your nirvana, you’d have a coach who every single fan in the country absolutely loves. He’d have heritage in 17 different counties so they’d love him in Yorkshire, they’d love him in Cornwall. That would be fantastic. You’re not always going to get that. “Gareth Southgate has been fantastic for the FA with his rapport and the rebuilding of that organisation. I wouldn’t write off Eddie completely in terms of the fans. I know he’s controversial and he polarises massively but I don’t think every fan in the country hates him. “I don’t think [his book] undermined his relationship with any of the current England players. I think he was saying he would think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on his selection or to critique him on how he picks his teams. “Am I going to have a deep debate with Eddie about whether you should pick [Freddie] Steward or whether you should pick Marcus [Smith]? No, but I can challenge him on things, particularly when results go in the wrong direction.”",Sport/Sport,RFU set to name English successor to Eddie Jones before 2023 World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/rfu-set-to-name-english-successor-to-eddie-jones-before-2023-world-cup
3/27/2022,"Joe Biden is set to announce a tax aimed at US billionaires as part of his 2023 budget plans on Monday in a move that will likely delight many progressives in his party but could meet opposition from conservative Democrats who have already stymied his domestic agenda. The Washington Post, citing five sources and an internal administration document, said the “billionaire minimum income tax” plan would establish a 20% minimum tax rate on all American households worth more than $100m. That would mean the majority of new revenue would come from billionaires, who are a frequent target of public and political ire for tax avoidance schemes. The paper said it would be “a tax on the richest 700 Americans for the first time”. The Post said that the White House Office of Management and Budget and the council of economic advisers estimated some 400 billionaire US families paid an average federal tax rate of just about 8% of their income between 2010 and 2018 – much lower than millions of Americans who are far less wealthy. The newspaper quoted the administration document as saying: “The billionaire minimum income tax will ensure that the very wealthiest Americans pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income … This minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters.” Biden has surprised many progressives in his party by pursuing an ambitious domestic agenda to the left of his campaign for the party’s presidential nomination. However, opposition from key centrists, notably the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin and Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, have largely put paid to those plans as they failed to garner enough support in the tightly split Senate. Although Biden is looking for ways to motivate his party’s activists, and appeal to voters, ahead of widely expected losses in November’s midterm elections, there is little sign that the party’s centrists will now support a more progressive agenda.",News/US news,Biden to announce tax on billionaires in 2023 budget plan – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/joe-biden-billionaires-tax
