5/2/2022,"A feminist march on the eve of May Day, known as Walpurgnisnacht, when witches traditionally meet, kicked off May Day demonstrations in Berlin, with a group of around 2,500 ”Take back the night”. The demonstration, described as lively and initially peaceful, was aimed at reconquering the night for women, lesbians, intersex and transgender people, according to the organisers. Accompanied by a large police presence, it concentrated on the northern and central Prenzlauerberg and Mitte districts of Berlin. But police intervened to stop the march after some participants set fire to coloured flares and bottles were thrown. Later in the evening, protesters apparently acting independently of organisers threw paint at shop windows and several panes of glass were broken, leading to three arrests. Charges were brought for breaching the peace, violent assault, bodily harm and criminal damage, police spokesperson Anja Dierschke told broadcaster rbb24. Walpurgisnacht is an event in German folklore when witches meet to hold revels with the devil, traditionally in the region of north central Germany on the Brocken mountain. Tens of thousands of others took to the streets elsewhere across the country too, drawing attention to a wide range of issues dominated by the war in Ukraine, the rising cost of living, workers’ rights, rental controls and plans to invest heavily in the German military. A separate demonstration around an election campaign event in the northern state of Schleswig Holstein saw foreign minister Annalena Baerbock face accusations of warmongering for her support of providing arms to Ukraine. A later event in the day in which she was due to participate had to be called off after protesters sprayed the stage with butyric acid. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking to a May Day rally in Düsseldorf, said he respected the values of pacifists but defended his decision to send arms to Ukraine, and said that equipment and aid would keep on coming to the country. He said with a looming food crisis expected to hit Africa in particular, because of wheat and other basic food supplies unable to be shipped from Ukraine, he pledged Germany’s support to help countries in need. “I respect all pacifism, I respect all values,” said Scholz. “But it would be cynical to tell a citizen of Ukraine he must defend himself against Putin’s aggression if he has no weapons.”. Frank Werneke, leader of Europe’s largest trade union, Verdi, speaking at a rally in Mainz, warned against a new arms race following Scholz’s recent announcement that he would provide €100bn (£840m) to update Germany’s military. Werneke said the injection of such large amounts of money also from the United States and elsewhere, was in danger of disadvantaging poorer sections of society in particular. “What we don’t want is a new arms race that comes at the expense of badly needed investments in social welfare, education and climate protection,” he said. In Dortmund police intervened to break up protests involving leftwing demonstrators. But a spokesperson for the anti-fascist group Autonome Antifa 170 accused police of violence and said several of its members had been injured. The group had gathered to prevent a march of more than 200 rightwing extremists. In Berlin the far-left Linke party called on the government to introduce a new law ensuring that if federal holidays, such as this year’s May Day, fall on a weekend, workers are given a weekday off to compensate.",News/World news,Feminist ‘witch’ protest kicks off May Day protests in Berlin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/feminist-witch-protest-kicks-off-may-day-protests-in-berlin
5/2/2022,"Obstacle-course racing is close to being named as the new fifth sport in modern pentathlon, replacing equestrian show jumping, in a highly contentious move that opponents warn will plunge the sport deeper into civil war. The Guardian can reveal that Team GB’s Tokyo 2020 champion Joe Choong is among a group of Olympic and world medallists who wrote to the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, on Sunday urging him to intervene and accusing the sport’s governing body, the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne, of ignoring the wishes of its athletes. “The IOC was clear in its expectation that athletes must play a central role in the review and consultation process for a fifth discipline,” the letter states. “This has not happened.” The letter also cites a poll by Pentathlon United, an independent athlete representative body, which found that over 95% of athletes are unhappy with the UIPM’s decision. And it calls upon the IOC to conduct a “comprehensive and independent investigation” into its lack of transparency. “The UIPM’s consultation process has been illusory at best and, it would appear, designed only to legitimise a predetermined outcome (which we are advised will be obstacle racing in collaboration with World OCR),” the letter adds. “Certainly, the athlete body has been excluded from any meaningful participation.” The letter comes in the lead-up to a crucial meeting of the UIPM’s executive board on Monday, where campaigners expect obstacle racing will be voted through before an announcement on Tuesday – unless there is a last-minute intervention. The UPIM decided to scrap show jumping in November after distressing scenes at the Tokyo Games when a horse was punched by a German coach after it refused to jump a fence. It immediately faced fierce opposition from most athletes, who urged it to reform the show jumping phase rather than remove it. Initially the UPIM wanted cross-country cycling as a replacement. However amid concerns it would raise the hackles of the International Triathlon Union, obstacle course racing became the strong favourite. Whatever decision is made, it is clear that losing show jumping will fundamentally change modern pentathlon, which has been a core Olympic event since 1912 and has always tested athletes in fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting and cross-country running. However the UIPM believes the sport has to modernise if it wants to be selected for the 2028 LA Olympics. The former British modern pentathlete Kate Allenby, who won a bronze for Team GB at the Sydney Olympics and has led the campaign against the UIPM, told the Guardian that the situation was serious but vowed the athletes would fight on. “We face the biggest threat to our existence in over 100 years,” she said. “Instead of open honest and transparent dialogue about future direction for our sport, the UIPM leadership has chosen to maintain a closed and secretive process with non-disclosure agreements placed on anyone involved in the working group. “It is a hallmark of the way this UIPM leadership has run our sport for decades. It has led to our sport being removed from the Olympics. As the athletes have made overwhelmingly clear in our survey this is no longer acceptable to them.” Whether the IOC will listen is open to doubt, however. Last December Bach told modern pentathlon that it had to come up with a proposal for the “replacement of horse riding and demonstrate a significant reduction in cost and complexity and show improvements in safety, accessibility, universality and appeal for youth”.",Sport/Sport,Modern pentathlon faces civil war over plans to introduce obstacle race,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/athletes-feel-excluded-from-obstacle-race-plans-modern-pentathlon
5/2/2022,"The government faces intense pressure from its own MPs and opposition parties to take action over misogyny and harassment in Westminster after a senior minister denied institutional problems, saying the issue was simply “some bad apples”. A day after the Conservative MP Neil Parish resigned for watching pornography in the Commons, and as yet more allegations emerged about seemingly endemic sexual misconduct, a Tory ex-minister said Kwasi Kwarteng’s comments “dismissed and belittled” the experiences of female MPs. Labour warned that a toxic culture in Westminster was exacerbated by inaction from Downing Street, while its deputy leader, Angela Rayner, wrote to Boris Johnson about reports that one No 10 Christmas party saw a ‘sexist of the year’ award handed out. Kwarteng, the business secretary, faced significant criticism after rejecting the idea of inherent sexism in parliament, arguing that problems were mainly caused by long hours and overwork, and that very few MPs transgressed. “I don’t think there’s a culture of misogyny,” he told Sky News. “I think the problem we have is that people are working in a really intense environment, there are long hours and I think generally, most people know their limits.” Speaking later to Times Radio, he said the problem was “some bad apples”, who should be punished, adding: “But that doesn’t mean that the entire culture is extremely misogynistic or full of male entitlement. I don’t recognise that.” Caroline Nokes, the Tory former minister who chairs the Commons women and equalities committee, said Kwarteng’s view went against the testimony of numerous MPs. “Colleagues shared examples of the aggressions and micro aggressions they face every day, and it’s being dismissed by a senior cabinet member as the result of working long hours,” she said. “Once more the experiences of female MPs are dismissed and belittled. That in itself is a classic example of institutional sexism.” Wendy Chamberlain, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, said Kwarteng was “deluding himself”. She said: “This is not a few bad apples, it is a culture that is rotten to the core. In the same week that two of his MPs resigned and his female colleagues complained, the worst thing he can do is trivialise and dismiss this.” Keir Starmer argued that with a series of misconduct cases, the government had either tried to ignore the issue or to delay any robust action, saying “their first instinct is to push it off into the long grass, hide what’s happening”. “That is a political problem, because a fish rots from the head, and there needs to be political leadership on this as well,” he told Sky News. “And we haven’t seen that yet from the Conservative party.” Senior Tories have been pushing to get more female MPs, but Kwarteng said he is not “a fan of quotas” to boost their numbers. Speaking to LBC Radio on Sunday, the senior Labour MP Chris Bryant said that when he was first elected in 2001 he was “regularly touched up by older, senior gay – they weren’t out – MPs”, adding: “I never felt I was able to report it because you end up being part of the story, that’s the last thing you want.” The Sunday Times reported a series of claims, including that one MP was accused of licking the faces of male researchers in bars; that a female Tory MP was sent a “dick pic” by a colleague; and that another MP had been warned about his use of sex workers. The Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has suggested one way to safeguard staff would be to change the current system by which MPs employ their staff directly, instead doing this centrally. He said he is considering an outside body employing aides as he moved to establish a “Speaker’s conference” bringing MPs together to discuss an overhaul. In Rayner’s letter to Johnson, she asked for details about another claim in the Sunday Times, that at a Downing Street party in December 2020 one aide was presented with a “sexist of the year” award. Rayner also queried whether this had been reported to Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating alleged lockdown-breaking gatherings in parallel with a police inquiry. “You have claimed on the record this week that there is ‘no place’ for sexism in politics, and yet there are now serious and credible allegations in the Sunday Times that sexist behaviour has not only taken place in your own office, but has been celebrated and rewarded,” Rayner wrote. “You are ultimately responsible for the culture and activity that takes place within Downing Street under your administration. If true, these allegations are not only at odds with your professed opposition to sexism, but set a terrible example and must result in further action.” The furore over institutionalised sexism in politics kicked off a week ago with a much-criticised Mail on Sunday story citing unnamed Tory MPs saying Rayner would cross and uncross her legs during prime minister’s questions to distract Boris Johnson. The paper leaped to its own defence this week, insisting Rayner was the source of the anecdote and that it had been unfairly targeted by opponents of a free press. A Labour source said: “The vile suggestion that Angela Rayner initiated the sexist smears that have been made against her must be some kind of sick joke.” Parish’s departure will pave the way for a byelection in the Tory safe seat of Tiverton and Honiton, and he still faces an investigation by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). It was the latest in a series of damning developments that have dogged the Commons in recent weeks. Senior Labour MP Liam Byrne is set to be suspended from the Commons for two days for bullying a member of staff; David Warburton had the Conservative whip withdrawn after allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use emerged; and former Tory Imran Ahmad Khan resigned after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. The ICGS has told MPs it is “seeing a similar trend” to the previous year when cases were started against 15 MPs.",News/Politics,‘Some bad apples’: senior Tory minister denies institutional misogyny,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/01/some-bad-apples-senior-tory-minister-denies-denies-institutional-misogyny
5/2/2022,"From wartime service developing camouflage and escape aids as a member of MI9’s “A Force” in Cairo, to being secretary of the World Disarmament Campaign and developing the musical Peace Child, my mother, Eirwen Harbottle, who has died aged 100, packed more into her long life than many could achieve in two. “Don’t squander your life,” she counselled. “You rarely regret the things you did do, only the things you didn’t.” The daughter of Helen (nee Hayes) and Hugh Llwellyn-Jones, who was the manager of the Ottoman Bank in Nicosia, Eirwen was born and brought up in Cyprus. After attending Warwick high school in the UK, she returned to Cyprus, but in 1941 was evacuated from there to South Africa. She worked in Cape Town as a recorder for the Government Intelligence Records Bureau, keeping track on names of people who might be consorting with the enemy. In 1943 she returned to Cyprus and, due to her work in Cape Town, was recruited for A Force in MI9, then transferred to Cairo. Her boss there was Tony Simonds, a lieutenant colonel in MI9; they married the same year. After living in Jerusalem and Saudi Arabia, in 1946 they settled in Cyprus. Together they started a flower farm in the Kyrenia mountains. Eirwen also helped set up the English programme of the CBS (Cyprus Broadcasting Service) both in radio and then TV, where she was a newsreader. That marriage ended in divorce in 1969, after Eirwen met Brigadier Michael Harbottle, chief of staff for the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus. They married in 1972 and moved to St John’s Wood, north London. Michael was involved in the peace movement, which was rare for a high-ranking officer, and the couple were friends with the Nobel peace laureates Fenner Brockway and Philip Noel Baker, who set up the World Disarmament Campaign. In 1980 Philip asked them to run it. Michael became the general secretary, and Eirwen secretary for two years. During this time Eirwen had the idea of creating a children’s musical about peace. She introduced the composer and songwriter David Gordon to the author of The Peace Book, Bernard Benson, and together they created Peace Child. Its premiere was at the Royal Albert Hall, on the final night of Disarmament Week, in October 1981 and it was subsequently performed all over the US and the former Soviet Union. Eirwen was chair of the trustees of the continuing Peace Child organisation until 2009. In 1982 she and Michael had founded the Centre for International Peacebuilding, which was focused on helping the UN deliver constructive peacemaking and peacekeeping. Eirwen was co-director and never really retired. Her two priorities were always what role the military could play in building peace, and how young people could make a difference in our world. Michael died in 1997. Eirwen is survived by her two daughters, Sally-Anne and me, from her first marriage, four grandchildren, Charles, Julian, Alexander and Natasha, and seven great-grandchildren, Fred, Scarlett, Camilla, Freda, Louis, Robin and Amira.

5/2/2022,"My friend Robert Molteno, who has died aged 79, was the editorial director of Zed Books for 27 years and helped build its reputation as the pre-eminent radical academic publisher concerned with the developing world. Robert combined a sharp analysis of current issues with a commitment to scholars from the global south, seeking out authors whose work and ideas were ignored by mainstream publishers. The books he made available in English for the first time included Nawal El Saadawi’s The Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World (1980), which drew attention to the widespread practice of female genital mutilation, and her bestselling novel, Woman at Point Zero (1983). Among many important works commissioned by Robert were Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition, by Cedric Robinson (1983), and Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality, by Pervez Hoodbhoy (1991). Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Robert was introduced to political activism by his father, Donald Molteno, a human rights lawyer prominent in opposition to the apartheid regime. His British-born mother, Molly (nee Goldsmith), was a French teacher. Robert was educated at the Diocesan college in the city and then studied law at the University of Cape Town, where he was on the executive of the anti-apartheid National Union of South African Students. He graduated in 1965, and the following year married fellow student Marion Marquard, who later became a novelist under the name of Marion Molteno. He then undertook a master’s in political science at the University of Manchester (1968). The couple moved to newly independent Zambia, where Robert taught public administration and political science at the University of Zambia. During that time he wrote Politics in Zambia (1974), with William Tordoff, and a textbook on civics for secondary schools. I first met Robert in Zambia in 1972 when writing a book about Africa, and we remained in close contact for 50 years. In 1976, during a political crisis at the university, Robert was detained on spurious charges for two months without trial, and then deported. He and his young family settled in Clapham, south-west London, and Robert began working at Zed Books, where he stayed until 2005. He then worked at the International African Institute, based at Soas University of London, until retirement in 2008. Alongside his publishing work, as a founder of the Wandsworth Association of School Parents Robert took a prominent role in campaigns to save the Inner London Education Authority from abolition. Though they did not succeed, he became convinced of the potential of community action. After his retirement, he became an influential figure, both in Wandsworth and across London, in the Living Streets movement to create healthier, safer streets for pedestrians. Partly as a result of a wide-ranging survey organised by Robert, in 2019 Transport for London began reviewing all its pedestrian crossings to make them safer. He also pressed Wandsworth council to introduce a trial of protective school street closures in 2020, and it has now expanded the scheme. Robert is survived by Marion, their daughters, May and Star, six grandchildren, and his brother Frank.",Arts/Books,Robert Molteno obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/01/robert-molteno-obituary
