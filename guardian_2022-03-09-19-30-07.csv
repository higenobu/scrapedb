3/9/2022,"Two people who were arrested after a baby girl was mauled to death by a husky in Lincolnshire have been released under investigation. Police said the three-month-old girl, who has not been named, died after sustaining injuries from a dog attack in the car park area of the woodland area Ostler’s Plantation, near Woodhall Spa, late on Sunday night. A 40-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of being in charge of a dog that was out of control, and have been released under investigation. Police said they believed the breed involved was a husky and that the animal was in isolation in kennels while forensic examinations were being carried out. Emergency services were called to the scene at 11.13pm on Sunday night, but despite efforts from paramedics to save the girl, she was pronounced dead. A white Sprinter van and a quad bike have been seized in connection to the incident, police said. DCS Andy Cox, from Lincolnshire police, said: “This is an exceptionally sad incident, and one that we know will impact the local community, or indeed anyone hearing about it. “There may be a temptation to speculate about what happened while people attempt to understand this tragedy, and we’d ask people to avoid doing so, particularly on social media where facts can become distorted. We will do everything we can to establish what has happened, and we’d like to thank everyone for their support.”",News/UK news,Two released under investigation after baby killed by dog in Lincolnshire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/two-released-under-investigation-baby-dog-attack-lincolnshire
3/9/2022,"On 12 January 2000, exactly 31 years after the New York Jets won their first Super Bowl, the front page of the New York Times carried the news that the team had been bought for $635m by Robert Wood Johnson IV, whose great-grandfather had founded Johnson & Johnson. Woody Johnson was not well known then, and in a release provided by the team, he issued the kind of bland statement you’d expect from a first-time sports-team owner: “We want to emphasize that we are totally dedicated to bringing a winning and a championship team to this area.” Well, that was 22 years ago, and the Jets have yet to play in a second Super Bowl – let alone win one. In fact, they have not made the playoffs in 11 years, the longest current drought in the NFL. So Chelsea fans should be wary after ESPN, citing “sources close to the situation”, reported on Monday that Johnson is readying a bid to buy the club from Roman Abramovich. Under Johnson, the Jets have set the standard for mediocrity, or even worse. Johnson’s boldest statement as an owner came in January 2009, when he hired the bombastic Rex Ryan to be his coach. That April, the Jets traded up in the draft to select the Southern California quarterback Mark Sanchez. It was a glorious time for the Jets, who played in back-to-back AFC championship games. They lost both, but the madcap Ryan, the unspectacular but efficient Sanchez and a rambunctious defense formed a nucleus that looked as if it would last a while. That second AFC title game, a 24-19 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in July 2011, is the Jets’ last playoff appearance, though. Ryan bombed out and was fired in 2014. Sanchez’s career tumbled after his infamous “butt-fumble” in 2012, when he collided with the rump of a Jets lineman and lost the ball, which New England returned for a touchdown. The Jets have had only one winning season since. Although Johnson does not coach, draft and trade players, he appoints the people who do – and their recent track record has been poor. They have selected, and dumped, another first-round quarterback from USC, Sam Darnold, drafting another quarterback in the first round, Zach Wilson, who struggled mightily in his rookie season, albeit with a poor supporting cast. Some of the Jets’ coaching hires have been questionable too. In 2019 they replaced Todd Bowles with Adam Gase, who was coming off two losing seasons in charge of the Miami Dolphins. The move was so odd that even Gase looked confused at his unveiling. He was fired after the Jets lost 23 of their next 32 games and has not worked in the NFL since. Bowles, meanwhile, masterminded the Tampa Bay defense that helped Tom Brady win the Super Bowl last year. And then there’s Johnson’s reputation off the field. He is known to be genteel and polite and rarely says anything carrying depth and import. But he has close links to a dubious global leader. Donald Trump appointed him as ambassador to the United Kingdom in 2017. Johnson soon denied he had suggested the US could buy Britain’s much loved NHS. During his time in London Johnson is said to have developed, or deepened, his love for the other kind of football, and Chelsea in particular. Fandom is great, but Johnson’s passion sounds shallow, particularly when his interest in American football sounds like a passing fancy. In the well-received 2018 book Big Game: The NFL in Dangerous Times, the journalist Mark Leibovich famously described Johnson as looking “slightly daydreamy and disoriented … like an overgrown third-grader who collects toy trains and rotten quarterbacks”. The Jets’ beleaguered fans said on Twitter on Monday athat they would be happy to hand Johnson to Chelsea if it meant he got rid of the Jets. That does not appear to be part of the plan, however. Chelsea would be another toy train for his man cave. The past two Super Bowls have been won by teams owned by people who also own Premier League clubs: the Glazer family (Tampa Bay and Manchester United) and Stan Kroenke (Los Angeles Rams and Arsenal) – and neither of those parties is popular with fans of those soccer teams, particularly the widely reviled Glazers. Abramovich never attracted that kind of ire from Chelsea fans because he helped make the team a perennial power, with 19 major trophies in his nearly 19 years as owner, including five Premier League titles and two in the Champions League. Johnson’s NFL team have won nothing in that time. And, while Johnson is a very rich man (Bloomberg estimates his net worth at around $5.67bn) he has nowhere near the resources of Abramovich, who bought much of Chelsea success with his own money. “There is a story going around that Jets owner Woody Johnson has an interest in buying the Chelsea football club Over There,” tweeted Mike Lupica, the longtime New York sports columnist on Monday. “And if you’re a Chelsea fan – what’s the good news?” That is not to say Chelsea can’t, or won’t, stay at the top during a Woody Johnson regime: the Jets are not a complete dumpster fire. Their new head coach, Robert Saleh, is promising, Wilson certainly has talent and the team have the No 4 overall pick and three other selections in the first two rounds in the draft next month. A Super Bowl is still a long way off, though. Johnson is not the only person chasing Chelsea, either. But Johnson usually gets what he wants. To get the Jets, he outbid Charles Dolan, who controls the New York Rangers and Knicks and founded Cablevision and HBO. It is noteworthy that Johnson has sent up a trial balloon to gauge interest in him owning Chelsea. Still, swapping Abramovich for Johnson would appear to be swapping a Russian oligarch for an American oligarch to control one of the best and most valuable football clubs in the world – moreover, an English club that has been around for 117 years. And Johnson’s team have won only 27 of 97 games in the past six years. Jets fans have waited 53 years for a Super Bowl win; Chelsea fans may have to get used to holding their breath if Johnson takes over at Chelsea too.",Sport/Football,Chelsea fans should take one look at Woody Johnson’s Jets and be very afraid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/09/woody-johnson-chelsea-bid-rumours-new-york-jets-owner
3/9/2022,"Both Canada and hosts China enjoyed double gold celebrations at the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon Centre as day five of the 2022 Winter Paralympics saw six gold medals decided in the cross-country sprinting. Brian McKeever held off Jake Adicoff of the US to win the men’s sprint free visually impaired category by 0.8 seconds, but the closeness of the time doesn’t convey the ease with which the Canadian had slowed up and still claimed his 15th career Winter Paralympics gold medal. McKeever began losing his sight age 19 due to Stargardt disease and plans to retire from competition after these Games. Natalie Wilkie of Canada also struck gold, winning the women’s standing free final by three seconds, adding a second gold after she won the long-distance cross-country event on Monday. The two golds for Canada have moved the country up into second place in the medal table, with seven golds, two silver and seven bronze medals in total. British athletes Callum Deboys, Hope Gordon and Steve Thomas all failed to qualify for the later stages of Wednesday’s events, but Deboys, who finished 22nd in the men’s sitting qualification said: “For me and where I am that’s as good a result as I can get just now. I’m over the moon. I’m just trying to soak everything up and enjoy myself and get as much experience as I can with a view to the next Games.” Gordon was 17th in the women’s sitting event as she became the first female Para Nordic skier for ParalympicsGB, and is looking forward to racing again on Saturday. “I’ve got 7.5km on Saturday, never done one of them before, so not really got a huge amount of expectations, once again just try and get round it, it’s 7,300 metres longer than I’m used to racing,” she said. This is only the sixth time a Chinese team has appeared at the Winter Paralympics, and in their previous five appearances they had just one gold – in wheelchair curling in 2018 – to show for it. That has all changed in Beijing, where they now have 31 medals in total, including two golds from Wednesday’s cross-country skiing. In the men’s sprint sitting, Zheng Peng finished ahead of compatriot Mao Zhongwu to make it a gold-silver double for the hosts. Then in the women’s race, Yang Hongqoing took gold, just managing to hold off a late surge from Ukrainian-born US para athlete Oksana Masters, who claimed her third silver of these Games to go with the gold she won on Saturday. In the cross-country sprint, athletes set off at time intervals determined by their relative levels of impairment, so in the standing event, for example, athletes with upper limbs impairments who cannot use poles lead off the race, with those who can use one pole starting in a second group, and those who can use two poles starting last. The staggered start guarantees the races usually conclude with a bunched finish and only seconds separating athletes with widely differing levels of impairments. The remaining medals of the day went to Benjamin Daviet of France, who won the men’s standing event. The 32-year-old previously earned three medals, including two golds, in Pyeongchang in para biathlon. Carina Edlinger of Austria won the visually impaired category for women, followed by Oksana Shyskova of Ukraine in silver. The British wheelchair curling team suffered a 6-3 defeat to Sweden, which means they will almost certainly need to win their three remaining round-robin games to stand a chance of progressing to the semi-finals. Their task has been made harder after team member David Melrose was carried off following a heavy fall from his wheelchair. The chair appeared to get jammed on one of the buffers at the side of the ice, and Melrose looked to have injured his shoulder in a fall that worried teammates and observers. Gary Smith was substituted in to complete the match. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee has revealed that Anastasiia Laletina pulled out of the middle-distance sitting event in the cross-country skiing on Tuesday after receiving news that her father – a soldier in the Ukrainian army – had been captured by Russian forces. The spokesperson said 19-year-old Laletina was still in Zhangjiakou and will fly to Poland with the rest of the team when the Games end.",Sport/Sport,Winter Paralympics: golds for Canada but GB curlers suffer injury and defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/winter-paralympics-golds-for-canada-but-gb-curlers-suffer-injury-and-defeat
3/9/2022,"A private plane with suspected links to Russia has been impounded in Hampshire, after aviation sanctions came into force designed to target the assets of those close to Vladimir Putin. The aircraft is registered in Luxembourg, but the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, suggested he was concerned it could be passed on by a Russian oligarch when it left the UK, so checks were being carried out. He told LBC radio on Wednesday: “We know that it isn’t a Russian company that holds the aircraft, it’s rather a Luxembourg-registered aircraft “We are carrying out further checks before releasing it and what we won’t do is allow any Russian oligarchs to pass on that jet when it does eventually go.” Russian airlines and private jets have already been banned from landing in the UK. But overnight the Foreign Office and Department for Transport announced new powers would make it a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly or land in the UK. The ban includes any aircraft owned, operated or chartered by anyone connected with Russia or designated individuals or entities on the sanctions list. It also allows the government to detain any aircraft owned by persons connected with Russia. The Foreign Office said the new sanctions would also prevent aviation and aerospace-related exports – including insurance and re-insurance through UK-based insurers or reinsurers. This means the withdrawal of UK insurance cover on existing policies in the two sectors and a ban on payouts for claims on existing policies. Shapps also revealed there had been just 760 visas issued to Ukrainians with family ties to Britain who wanted to join them. About 22,000 people have so far applied to come to the UK in an effort to flee the Russian invasion, he added. The minister said the details about the siege of Ukrainian cities by Russian forces were “pure evil” and heartbreaking, but defended Britain taking about a third the number of Ukrainian refugees as Ireland. Shapps said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had voiced hopes that those forced to leave Ukraine would move to neighbouring countries so they could come back to help rebuild after the war. Shapps also said the Uk government wanted to speed up visa processing and “make these things as unbureaucratic as possible”, but added that it was important security checks were carried out on those seeking to come to the UK. “I think you would expect us to be wanting to check people’s status before they come in,” he said. “We know that Russia are involved in all manner of operations so it’s absolutely right to check that somebody is coming from Ukraine and know who is coming to this country, essentially, and that’s what we are doing.” Shapps said the decision not to have a visa application centre in Calais was to avoid Ukrainians becoming the target of people smugglers who operated around the Channel port. He sidestepped questions about the claim by another Conservative MP that the home secretary, Priti Patel, had misled parliamentwhen she said a processing centre “en route” to Calais would be set up and that staff were “on the ground” there. “I do know that in Lille there is a centre being set up. I do also know that because of the nature of the situation in Calais – the long-term issues there of criminal gangs bringing people across – we are very keen to separate these two issues,” Shapps said.",News/UK news,UK seizes private jet with suspected links to Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/uk-seizes-private-jet-with-suspected-links-to-russia-hampshire-sanctions
3/9/2022,"Scots film-maker Ruth Paxton makes a very smart feature debut with this genuinely uncanny psychological horror-satire written by Justin Bull, about body image and the eating disorder from hell. Sienna Guillory is excellent as the stylish and well-to-do Holly, a single mum who cares deeply about her two teen daughters Betsey (Jessica Alexander) and Izzy (Ruby Stokes). Holly is maybe a little too caring and controlling: she spends ages creating beautiful meals for the girls and has a slightly cringe-making habit of making sure the loo rolls are laid out neatly, with the end of one folded into a cutesy “sailboat” design. Just when the family’s life seems entirely picture perfect, a strange, self-questioning malaise sets in: Betsey’s teacher asks her about university plans and what really interests her – a question that Betsey finds insidiously discomfiting. Meanwhile, Holly is watching Izzy ice-skating and out of the blue, up there in the bleachers, wonders to herself: “What is the point of it all?” Betsey has a nasty experience with drugs at a party, wanders out into some surrounding woodland where she appears to have an epiphany under a blood-red moon and from then on, she never eats another thing – but stays at exactly the same weight. Holly yells at her: “You have anorexia! And do you know who gets it? Entitled middle-class white girls!” But Betsey’s shrewdly unsentimental gran (a nice performance from Lindsay Duncan) compares Betsey to the Japanese mythic monster, the Futakuchi-onna, the woman with a second mouth hidden under her hair at the back of her head. Is Betsey a vampiric daemon, secretly consuming her family’s psychic happiness to keep her own weight up? Or is there another, more rational explanation connected with Holly’s relationship with food and with her mother? Paxton’s movie sketches out the sinister dread just under the happy-family surface; she is in expert control of her film, achieving her effects with economy and force. It is really unnerving.

3/9/2022,"When Henry Ruiz* and Raquel Hernandez boarded a bus heading north to America with their two young children, they knew there would be no going back. It was June 2021, and a few weeks earlier Ruiz, a 28-year-old banana farmer from central Mexico, had been abducted by a group of armed men and taken to an isolated ranch where 15 others – 13 men and two women – were being held. The assailants were members of an ultra-violent Mexican cartel fighting to take over the local banana industry, and needed to recruit locals as informants and hitmen in order to push out a rival gang and community self-defense force. Ruiz was beaten with planks of wood and wire, leaving him with two broken ribs, gashes across his back and unable to see out of his right eye. Photos seen by the Guardian confirm the injuries. According to Ruiz, he and five others were forced to kill and bury the rest of the detainees while gang members filmed the macabre acts. They took Ruiz’s motorbike, wallet and bank details before abandoning him on the road near his home. His bank account was emptied a few days later. The family fled as soon as Ruiz was strong enough to travel and arrived in Sonoyta, a small border town in the state of Sonora, hoping to seek asylum in the US. But the border was closed due to Title 42 – an arcane public health order issued in March 2020 by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under pressure from the Trump administration. “We were traumatised and terrified, with nowhere else to go,” said Ruiz, tearing up while recounting his experiences. Title 42, which the Biden government has elected to keep in place, has led to hundreds of thousands of people being denied their legal right to seek asylum since the start of the pandemic. The order effectively replaced Remain in Mexico – another controversial Trump-era deterrent policy also known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) – and has used the pretext of Covid to authorize more than 1.4m expulsions at the border in the past two years. “By and large immigration policy hasn’t changed under Biden, and that’s the problem,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the Washington-based American Immigration. Across the border, huge numbers of people are stuck – unable to move forward or go back. Ruiz said: “Title 42 has prevented us from living, everyday I wake up and nothing has changed. But the pandemic is just an excuse, as if people without papers can get Covid and those with papers are immune.” For the past eight months, the family has lived in a shelter, unable to venture more than a few blocks in fear of being apprehended by Mexican authorities or criminals. Their daughter, a bright shy girl with a big smile who just turned seven, misses school and her grandparents; their one-year-old son recently learned to walk. “I don’t know whether to cry or scream, we’re stuck and have no idea when this will end,” said Hernandez, 23, Ruiz’s wife. Sonoyta is an unremarkable desert town with 20,000 people, a booming asparagus industry, and a minor border crossing popular with American snowbird retirees and tourists heading to the beach. The town also has four shelters where almost 200 Mexicans and Central Americans had been stuck for months or more, hoping the Biden administration would rescind title 42. But last month, about a third left after immigration attorneys visiting the migrant resource centre told them that the border would likely remain shut unless pending litigation succeeded in exempting families from title 42. It’s not clear where they all went, but some tried their luck seeking asylum at other border crossings like Reynosa, Tamaulipas (which borders Phar, Texas), where the state governor banned Biden from expelling families with children under seven. Others paid coyotes or smugglers to cross the Sonoran desert – where thousands of people have died trying to traverse the remote, punishing terrain. “Title 42 has nothing to do with Covid, it’s a terrific vehicle for stopping immigration,” said John Orlowski from Shelters for Hope, a nonprofit which helped set-up the resource centre that provides meals, clothes, internet and medical care. “For people here the situation is worse under Biden: there’s no progress, few exceptions, and no updates.” In essence, title 42 has prohibited the vast majority of Mexicans and Central Americans from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala – the countries which historically account for most migrants and refugees – from being allowed to seek asylum in the US. Across the southern border, just over half of all arrivals have been turned away and expelled to Mexico or flown home on charter flights since the start of the pandemic, including thousands of Haitian asylum seekers. (Millions of Americans and those with visas enter the country overland and by plane every month.) But in south-west Arizona, where Trump constructed a 30ft border wall across the Sonoran desert through sacred Indigenous land and protected national parks, more than 80% of people have been expelled without the opportunity to make their case. “The Tucson sector has one of the highest expulsion rates along the border and the exemptions have no rhyme or reason which leaves people desperate. The Biden administration keeps hiding behind the CDC but the evidence suggests that title 42 has become part of the deterrent policy, and has nothing to do with public health,” said Reichlin-Melnick. There’s a major US customs and border protection (CBP) station between Sonoyta and Ajo, Arizona – a former mining community now popular with retirees, artists and humanitarian groups. But desperate people do desperate things, and this area has seen the highest level of desert deaths ever recorded. On a hot cloudless day last week, the Guardian accompanied volunteers from Ajo Samaritans on a tough hike to drop gallons of water and cans of beans in two remote areas where people are currently passing through. It was deep into the desert – a two-hour drive from Ajo, followed by a nine-mile round trip on foot through Organ Pipe Cactus national monument and Cabeza Prieta wildlife refuge – with virtually no shade. In the summer, temperatures regularly top 100F (38C). As migrants are forced to take longer, harder routes to avoid surveillance technology and border patrols, humanitarian groups struggle to keep up and get water to the right places. But amid the vast desolate cacti forest there were signs of recent human activity: empty energy drink cans, a pair of ripped beige jeans, a black cardigan and several worn out carpet shoes – makeshift denim slippers to avoid leaving footprints. Three gallons of water left by the volunteers a week earlier – their first drop at this location – were gone. The group came across two degraded bones in separate locations. Each was photographed and sent to the Pima county coroner, the location tagged on GPS, and the spot marked with a dated red ribbon. This was followed by a moment’s silence to reflect on the 3,830 immigrants who’ve died in the Arizona Sonora desert, and the disappeared not yet found. The coroner later confirmed that neither bone was human. Still, two degraded human remains have been found during water drops by these volunteers in the past fortnight. In January, 15 bodies were found across the desert, most months after they had died, according to Humane Borders and Pima county. In 2021, 226 mostly recently deceased bodies were recovered, a record high. “This isn’t just about title 42 or Remain in Mexico, it’s the prevention through detention (PTD) policy and continued increase in militarization of the border since 1994, which has forced people further and further into the desert. The PTD legislation is designed to kill people, and since its implementation the number of deaths has increased every year,” said Jo, a seasoned volunteer who asked for her surname be withheld. In his 2022 State of the Union address, Biden’s promise to reform immigration was met with derision by advocates. “President Biden is not just carrying out the toxic, white supremacist legacy of the Trump era, but unbelievably in some instances he has doubled down,” said Erika Andiola of the advocacy group Racies, in response to the speech. Both the White House and the CDC recently relaxed guidance on Covid public health measures as part of the “new phase” of the pandemic, without mentioning title 42. Avril Benoît, executive director of Doctors Without Borders USA, said: “The Biden administration is promoting a policy of learning to live with the virus, yet continues applying title 42 to turn away people seeking protection in the US… This is an outrageous double standard.” While the administration asked the supreme court to overturn a lower court decision blocking the end of Remain in Mexico, it has also expanded the pool of immigrants to which the policy applies. The CDC, which exempted unaccompanied children from title 42 soon after Biden took office, said it continues to review whether the order remains necessary to protect the public health every 60 days. Back in Sonoyta, Ruiz and Hernandez don’t have the money to pay a coyote to try and cross the dangerous desert or even get them to a different port of entry where they may be allowed to apply for asylum. Even if they could borrow the money, there’s no way of knowing if they’d be granted a rare exemption or simply turned away. Ruiz said: “I had a good job, we were happy. But now we have no choice, we must wait for an opportunity to sit down with someone and explain what happened and why we can never go back.” *Names have been changed for safety",News/US news,"‘Traumatised and terrified, with nowhere else to go’: huge numbers of people stuck at US border",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/us-mexico-border-title-42-biden-trump-stranded-asylum
3/9/2022,"Jenny Bennion has a wooden throne in her garden. It is a monument to the damage caused by Dudley, Eunice and Franklin, a hat-trick of storms that swept across the UK in the space of a week in February. It was the first time this had happened since the Met Office began naming storms in 2015. The trio battered down Bennion’s beloved 30-metre-tall Scots pine, which had overlooked her semi-detached house in Hutton, Lancashire, for more than a century. It was one of the reasons Bennion chose to move there two and a half years ago. The tree is believed to have been planted in 1901, the same year the house was built, and stood four metres away from it. Life feels strange without it. “It would have been nice if it could have stayed a bit longer,” she says. “I know it had to go, and all good things come to an end, but I loved it. I really did.” As gusts swept across the UK, the O2 Arena in London had part of its roof ripped off, while a 400-year-old oak crashed into a family home in Essex, killing four people. Given this destruction, it may seem odd that the loss of a tree could have such an impact, but, up and down the country, people are mourning arboreal friends. Talking about the loss of the 100-year-old “triangle tree” in his Cornish seaside town, Kevin from Bude told BBC Radio 4: “Seems a bit crazy having that sort of feeling towards a big old lump of timber, but a few tears have been shed and a few toasts have been drunk to the demise of the tree.” People do all kinds of seemingly mundane things under trees. For Kevin, it was eating pasties, and fish and chips cooked in dripping. For Bennion, who works for the Lancashire Wildlife Trust, it was reading her book in the dappled shade, watching nuthatches scamper down the trunk, and sitting under it when she felt stressed. Breaking off the bark would reveal lots of minibeasts; squirrels would race around the trunk; a big carrion crow used to sit in the canopy. Trees connect us to the deep past. Some Scots pine – the only native pine in the UK – live for up to 700 years. They were part of Scotland’s ancient Caledonian Forest, only fragments of which remain. We are increasingly aware that trees help sustain us on this planet, so a small loss of a tree speaks to a larger environmental loss, with the looming knowledge that extreme weather events that cause such destruction are likely to become more common as the climate crisis escalates. Since Arwen hit in November, more than 12m trees have been lost or affected by storms in the UK. In Hurricane Hits England, the poet Grace Nichols, who moved from Guyana to Britain in the 70s, wrote of the big storm of 1987: “It took a hurricane, to bring her closer / To the landscape,” describing trees falling “heavy as whales”, acknowledging that such extreme weather reminds us how we are connected to land and nature. For Brian McGhie, the chair of the Epping Forest conservation volunteers, the huge beech that tumbled in Gernon Bushes nature reserve reminded him of a dead elephant. He had had a soft spot for the tree, which was believed to be about 350 years old, since he first saw it in 1988. It was also loved by wildlife, including mice, jays, rooks and crows, which enjoyed eating its nuts. “You could describe it as a tragedy, because it was magnificent,” he says. “It was almost perfect, the way the branches grew out, and it was so tall. It dominated the area. Whenever I walked past it, I would stop and look at it in awe and be pleased it was there. It’s a great loss.” He was shocked when it fell, because it looked so healthy, but its carcass revealed it was riddled with rot. The tree was also special because it was a beech in a woodland full of hornbeam and oak. It was probably created by someone planting 10 to 15 beech saplings together in a bundle, which then fused to make one tree. “It’s a bit of a mystery. Why did someone plant a bundle of saplings there? Was it to get rid of them, or an experiment? Who knows?” says McGhie. In years past, beech trees were very useful. The person who planted this tree may have wanted it for firewood, to flavour hams and cheeses, or to use its leaves to stuff mattresses, which was more comfortable than using straw. Beech nuts were used as flour in bread and pastries. Nowadays, they are often engraved with declarations of love, because their bark is smooth and relatively soft. The tree will be left where it fell, becoming part of the woodland floor, and so another chapter of life will begin. Fungi and insects will make the most of its rotting imperfections. Sunlight will reach the forest floor, creating an opportunity for new plants to come up. As the beech fell, it smashed into surrounding trees, creating fissures and cracks that birds and mammals may be able to nest in, too. Denise Parker, a volunteer ranger at Richmond Park, south-west London, loved a 250-year-old gnarled and knotted beech on Broomfield hill, by the Kingston gate, which fell during the storms. It was one of many old trees in the park, which was formerly used as a royal hunting ground, particularly in Tudor times. The tree was a landmark for Parker, because it was at the top of a long hill, near a coffee shop. It taught her lessons about ageing. “It continued to be beautiful even though it was old, although some people might think it was an odd shape. That’s the thing: it doesn’t have to be a certain shape to be beautiful; it doesn’t have to be tamed, trained and manicured. It was purely its natural self, doing what a beech tree does,” she says. “Trees continue surviving and yet we make such a meal of it. That beech tree never tried being an oak, or sycamore, it was just being a beech tree, the best beech tree it could be. We’re always spending our lives trying to be something and are never quite satisfied.” Compared with humans, trees live a simple life, guided by the seasons, unfurling new leaves every spring without fail. “It’s reassuring to see that repeating each year, regardless of what’s going on in the world,” says Parker. As far as possible, trees in Richmond Park are left to rot where they fall, because dead wood is so rich for wildlife. Like McGhie, Parker will continue to visit her tree as it decays, to observe its rippling effects on the wider landscape. “Now, it’s almost a monument. I see lots of positives to take from that.” A tree reminds us that life goes on, even when the present may seem unbearable, says Dr James Canton, a writer and lecturer at the University of Essex and the author of The Oak Papers. It is a physical, living being that operates on a different timescale from us, linking to the past and our ancestors. “Humans are creatures of movement – that’s what we do. Whereas trees are born and die on the same bit of earth,” he says. “That sure-footedness is really appealing to us – I’m sure that’s what ties us to them.” In Richard Powers’ book The Overstory, he talks about the ways in which multiple human lives can live in parallel with the life of a single tree. “You and the tree in your back yard come from a common ancestor. A billion and a half years ago, the two of you parted ways,” he writes. It took a storm to fell trees for many people to recognise them as beings in our landscape. Canton says: “Trees are individual living beings. That’s not some wild, hippy statement, it’s just scientific truth; that’s what they are.” Over the weekend of Storm Eunice, the roots had started moving in Bennion’s garden. By the Monday, the ground was undulating. A tree surgeon visited and said there was nothing anchoring it to the ground. “‘I can’t save it,’ he said. ‘The only thing I can do now is try to save your house,’” recalls Bennion. The tree surgeon strapped the pine to another tree. On the Wednesday, once the wind had subsided, he took it down. She counted the rings on the chunks of trunk and considered what historic events the tree had seen. “We were counting them and going: ‘Right, that will have been the first world war, the second world war, and then up to when my gran was born, when my mum was born, when I was born,’” she says. Bennion wants to save a cross-section and label it, marking key life events for her family on the rings of wood. “I am really sad that it’s gone, although I’m very happy with my throne. I’m looking forward to sitting on it. It’s carved to face just where the sun goes down, so I’m going to sit and watch the sunset and remember how lovely the tree was.”",News/Environment,"‘It was magnificent – I’d look at it in awe’: the beloved trees felled by storms Eunice, Dudley and Franklin",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/beloved-trees-felled-storms-eunice-dudley-franklin-aoe
3/9/2022,"Thousands of demonstrators will gather in Brazil’s capital on Wednesday after one of the country’s leading musicians, Caetano Veloso, called a major protest to denounce what environmentalists call a historic assault on the Brazilian environment under President Jair Bolsonaro. The “Ato pela Terra” (Stand for the Earth) demonstration is being held in Brasília to oppose what activists call a “death combo” of five environment-related bills being considered by Brazil’s congress. The senate is expected to vote on three of those bills in the coming weeks, while two are expected to face votes in the lower house. If approved, the proposals would greenlight commercial mining on indigenous lands and jeopardize the land rights of tens of thousands of indigenous people; loosen environmental licensing requirements and regulations over pesticide use; and boost land grabbers and illegal loggers in the Amazon, where deforestation has soared under Brazil’s far-right president. “Each one of these bills robs Brazilians of a piece of their future,” the protest’s organizers said in a statement, lamenting the “incessant attack” on the environment that followed Bolsonaro’s 2018 election. “If this package of bills is approved, Brazil will become one of the biggest climate pariahs in the world,” they added. Veloso, who will be joined at the rally outside congress by celebrities including the rapper Emicida, the actor Lázaro Ramos and the singer Daniela Mercury, urged citizens to fight legislation that posed “a clear threat to the environment”. “I think it’s time for us to get out on to the streets and to show our faces,” said the 79-year-old songwriter. “I’m optimistic about the future of Brazil. That’s to say, I’m taking action to foster something new here, something that might enlighten the world,” Veloso told the Guardian. “But right now it’s hard to cling on to this mindset.” Ana Carolina Tessmann, a 31-year-old teacher, said she would march to condemn “the worst and cruelest” moment in Brazilian history. “I understand that it is my obligation as a citizen to actively take part in these protests,” Tessmann said. Protesters hope to convince lawmakers to reject or modify the bills – which have the support of the powerful agribusiness lobby – to reflect concerns over the climate emergency and the traditional populations affected by environmental destruction. “We want to tell [congress] that we will not accept this … If some of these bills pass, they will spell our destruction,” said Txai Suruí, 25, an indigenous activist from Rondônia, an Amazon state that is a deforestation hotspot. Marcio Astrini, an environmentalist who is one of the event’s organizers, warned the five pieces of proposed legislation could have devastating consequences for Brazil’s environment and the global climate. “The protest’s message is: do not vote for these bills in their current form because they are a disaster,” said Astrini, the executive director of the Climate Observatory. “They doom the country, they doom the environment, they doom our international reputation and they put the survival of the Amazon – and thus the Paris agreement targets – at risk.” Environmentalists fear that if the bills become law, they will enshrine Bolsonaro’s anti-environmental policies into law for years to come – even if he fails to secure a second term in this year’s election. Polls suggest Bolsonaro will lose October’s election to his leftwing rival, the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, having appalled many voters with his anti-scientific handling of a Covid pandemic, which has killed more than 650,000 Brazilians. But by then, Astrini warned, long-lasting damage to the environment might already have been done. “Even if we change the president and we change Brazil’s environmental stewardship, these [new] rules would make it very hard to fight environmental crime,” he said. “It would be like taking all of the harm being done by the government today, and ensuring it will continue causing harm and deforestation for years and decades to come.”",News/World news,Thousands to protest against Brazil’s ‘death combo’ of anti-environment bills,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/brazil-protest-environment-indigenous-bolsonaro
3/9/2022,"The British bus operator Stagecoach has dropped its support for a £1.9bn merger with National Express, instead agreeing to be taken over by a major German infrastructure investment fund in a £595m deal. In a sudden U-turn, Stagecoach said it was recommending a sale to the fund managed by DWS Infrastructure for 105p a share in cash, and has withdrawn support for the National Express bid. National Express and rival Stagecoach had sealed an all-share deal in December that would have brought Stagecoach’s UK local bus operations together with National Express’s intercity coach network. The group would have had its headquarters at National Express’s home in the West Midlands, and have a 40,000-strong vehicle fleet and a workforce of 70,000 people.That tie-up was being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority, which served an initial enforcement order in January to stop the firms from combining operations or selling any UK businesses while it looked into the deal. DWS, spun out from Deutsche Bank in 2018 via a flotation on the Frankfurt stock exchange, has a number of other investments in the UK, including Corelink Rail Infrastructure; Kelda, the owner of Yorkshire Water; and Peel Ports. Stagecoach said the DWS bid offered greater certainty for investors and employees, with the overall headcount of bus drivers expected to remain the same, while Stagecoach’s headquarters in Perth, central Scotland, will be retained along with its staff. It added that the new deal, which is expected to be completed in the first half of this year, would also provide continuity at the top, with the chief executive, finance director and UK managing director staying on. Martin Griffiths, the chief executive of Stagecoach, said: “The proposed offer presents a major opportunity to maximise the significant growth potential ahead as governments seek to deliver economic recovery, level up communities, provide better health outcomes for citizens, and transition to a net zero future. “We believe it will open a new and exciting chapter for Stagecoach, backed by a team who share our vision for a more sustainable future.” Stagecoach was launched in 1980 by Scottish businessman Sir Brian Souter and his sister, Dame Ann Gloag. The DWS takeover will mark the end of the Souter family’s long interest in the sector, having grown from buying out a small local bus company to one of the main players in Britain’s privatised bus and rail industries. Under the terms of the DWS takeover, Souter’s 14.5% stake in Stagecoach is worth £86.2m, while Gloag’s 10.5% holding is worth £62.5m. In recent years, Stagecoach has shrunk back, after selling its US operations and being squeezed out of UK rail. National Express also exited UK rail after selling its last franchise in 2017 but still runs trains in Germany and buses in the US, Canada, Morocco and Spain.",News/Business,Stagecoach opts for rival takeover in blow to National Express merger plan,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/stagecoach-opts-for-rival-takeover-in-blow-to-national-express-merger-plan
3/9/2022,"People living in the UK’s most deprived areas are more likely to be infected with Covid-19, but new research suggests this relationship is a two-way street: becoming infected also increases people’s risk of economic hardship, particularly if they develop long Covid. “We’ve shown that Covid has an impact on people’s ability to meet their basic household requirements – something that is only going to be exacerbated by the cost of living crisis which is happening at the same time,” said Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), who supervised the research. The findings have boosted calls for ministers to do more to support the growing number of working-age adults affected by the condition, which is also known as post-acute Covid syndrome (Pacs). “Many long-haulers have lost their jobs, and in some instances their partners have Pacs, so two salaries have been lost,” said Louise Barnes, founder of the PACS19 support group. “Whilst many have been able to get PIP [personal independence] payments, some haven’t, and are no longer being supported by their employers. They are facing a financial nightmare and need financial support.” According to the Office for National Statistics, about 1.3 million people, or 2% of the UK population, are living with long Covid. Those between 35 and 69 years of age are at greatest risk, and experts have expressed concerns about the impact of so many working-age people suffering from long-term symptoms and disability. To investigate the economic consequences of the illness, Martineau and colleagues analysed data from 16,910 Britons aged 16 years or over who completed monthly questionnaires about their health and household income between May 2020 and October 2021. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that testing positive for Covid was associated with a 39% increase in the odds of people reporting inadequate income to meet their basic needs, and a fivefold increase in the number of people reporting long-term term sickness absence from work, compared with those who didn’t become infected. The associations were strongest where catching Covid led to hospitalisation or the development of persistent symptoms, supporting the idea that Covid was the cause of people’s financial hardship. Anne Williamson, a health economist at QMUL’s Blizard Institute who led the research, said: “The vicious cycle of poor health and poverty that we identify should lead policymakers to consider early, decisive interventions to break this downward spiral – including employment advice and other economic support, as well as healthcare follow-up.” In January, MPs on the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus called on the government to recognise Covid-19 as an occupational disease – a move that could help to standardise support and care for those affected, and improve data collection on the problem across the country. The MPs also urged ministers to set up a compensation scheme for key workers who have suffered financially through loss of work. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran , who is also chair of the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said: “As has been the case throughout this pandemic, the greatest burdens have fallen disproportionately on lower income and front line workers, and we’ve heard first hand how the debilitating symptoms of Long Covid can impact a person’s ability to work. “The ONS estimates that Long Covid is impacting almost 1.3 million people in the UK and yet, the government have their heads firmly in the sand about the impact this will have on our economy and essential services. “They must urgently increase resources for research into treatment and provide compensation to the frontline workers who have sacrificed their health and wealth protecting this country.” ",News/Society,"Having Covid-19 linked to risk of economic hardship, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/09/covid-19-risk-economic-hardship-poverty-study-suggests
3/9/2022,"After a series of shows teasing at hot-button issues (gender, white identity, leftwing politics), Fin Taylor changed tack last year with So My Wife … It drew on his interest in vintage, ’er-indoors comedy, and a time when no one expected anything more from comedians than a battery of (ideology-free) jokes. What we get, in a show now on YouTube, feels a little more politically engaged than that. But not politically committed – you are left with no sense of what Taylor really thinks, nor any sustained inquiry of the type that made his earlier shows rewarding. Perhaps if the set were much funnier, its superficiality and ideological hedging would be easier to love. I’m not sure jokes and values can be so easily disentangled, mind you – certainly not in a show that touches on gender, environmentalism and the rest. In Taylor’s quips about how annoying Greta Thunberg is, or how he might “identify as a nine-year-old” to win junior football matches, is it the worldview that is deflating – or just the hoary quality of the gags? It’s the opening stages that deliver on Taylor’s latter-day Bernard Manning premise, as he talks about his new wife and their efforts to conceive a child. The attritional sex that requires, and a later routine about breast pumps, find Taylor milking a productive duct of carnal comedy, even if the ironic chauvinism (“my wife’s a hog” etc) feels gratuitous. The shock-jockery sometimes carries a frisson (baiting older people for monopolising vaccines, for example) but is often built on flimsy foundations, as when he mocks progressives for non-interference when Islam and homosexuality collide. Addressing subjects like that, a fondness for old-school, mother-in-law comedy will only take you so far.
