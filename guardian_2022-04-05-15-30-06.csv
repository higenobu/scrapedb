4/5/2022,"What’s in a name? That which we call a Michael Mann-fronted crime drama series by any other branding would go just as hard. The title of his latest small-screen enterprise Tokyo Vice (the noted film-maker directed the pilot and served as executive producer on the rest of the HBO Max project) implies some link to his Miami Vice, either the 80s-zeitgeist TV show he produced or the hyper-formalist film remake he directed in 2006. But there’s little trace of the cocaine-cool atmosphere that defined the former or the polarizing digital video textures that defined the latter, the later episodes (critics were shown five of eight in advance) lacking the visual distinction that sets the first apart from the glut of streaming content. Our guy’s not even a cop – we follow writer Jake Adelstein (Ansel Elgort), an American stranger in the strange land of Japan’s top newspaper, the first gaijin to land a byline on its pages. For his tell-all memoir recounting his investigations of yakuza activity in the city, the real Adelstein (also an executive producer here) used Mann’s classic neo-noir property as a spiritual namesake, a loose connection now made to look like a cinematic universe. Though playwright JT Rogers presides as showrunner and a handful of directors organize themselves under a sleek house style, the bonding agent between Vices is still Mann’s pet fascinations. The fastidiousness of men doing difficult, detail-oriented jobs represents the core appeal of a show focused on the finer points of its procedural elements, for both journalism and police work. As in most of Mann’s film output, the line between law enforcement and crime grows hazy in the muted respect the opposing factions have for one another’s expertise. And it’s entirely possible that Mann brought his talents to Tokyo for no other reason than it is the city with the highest number of immaculately tailored suits per capita. Loyalists to the unprolific auteur will be overjoyed that he’s still doing his thing within the parameters set for him, like a jam band hiding snippets of their greatest hits in an hourlong medley. Everyone else will be pleased to find that this is all more accessible to the uninitiated than that analogy might suggest. There’s an inherent watchability in Jake getting his feet wet at his assumed home’s paper of record, mostly in the affable assimilation that the shoe-leather reporting entails. The show draws attention to how much Japanese the American actor Elgort has learned to speak and write for the gig, absolute second-nature fluency being a prerequisite for Jake’s elite new job. His ability to land a story depends more on his manner in the field, however, and his developing ability to navigate the complicated social codes not outlined in his guidebooks. Grizzled detective Katagiri (Ken Watanabe, a commanding screen presence of stoic gravitas) takes Jake under his wing and explains the elaborate web of agreed-upon lies that maintains the uneasy peace between warring clans of gangsters. Preventing an all-out conflict with a high body count can supersede day-to-day police work; when Katagiri needs three perps, he takes the low-level grunts the brutal oyabun running the family gives him, regardless of their involvement. Adelstein’s job demands that he make waves in these stagnant waters, putting both sides of the law in a race to make him their useful ally before he can jam them up. The show’s curious yet reverent exploration of turn-of-the-millennium Tokyo wends in and out of dojos, love hotels and the most expressively lit restaurants the city has to offer. At a hostess club, where sophisticated women dote on male customers in the purest form of emotional labor, a subplot emerges involving a driven employee with ambitions to open her own pleasure palace. Until Samantha (Rachel Keller) gets a backstory midway through the series’ run, she doesn’t seem to serve much purpose in a narrative often isolating her from the action, and once she does, we wonder what took so long. Her presence does compound the slippery question of how to consider a show set in Japan that foregrounds the perspectives of white expats, even if they’re models of transplant citizenship. Aside from Jake getting constantly mocked for his out-of-placeness, and eventually learning to use it to his advantage, the show doesn’t pay too much mind to the potential thorniness of its politics. Mann and those coordinated through his vision would rather dig into the nitty-gritty of process, the pleasing payoffs as information comes together and falls into place. Bolstered by taut dialogue verging on the hardboiled, a smattering of viciously swift action, and a lead performance from a star more comfortable than we’ve ever seen him, it’s an exceptionally accomplished take on the True Detective/Mare of Easttown mold in vogue as of late. This isn’t revolutionary television, especially as HBO positions itself at the fore of this genre’s recent spike in popularity, but it’s done here with greater specificity and finesse. Just goes to show – you can’t send some medium-talent journeyman to do a Mann’s job.

4/5/2022,"Agreen-painted four-storey house near the main bus station on the outskirts of Baku is where Roza Huseynova and her children found refuge. “Until I came here, I thought there were no good people in this life,” says Huseynova, 38, who escaped an abusive marriage last year. “But my children and I have learned how to feel joy, how to laugh,” she says. The shelter is run by Mehriban Zeynalova, 66. “I would have never received an ID on my own,” says Huseynova. “My husband would never have let me change the school of my children.” Domestic abuse is estimated to account for 5% of crimes in Azerbaijan, and femicide is on the rise, but a culture of secrecy means the true statistics are unknown. “When a woman is beaten, she is expected to keep silent and not give away family secrets,” says Zeynalova. There is often nowhere to go. In 2010, the law demanded the establishment of state-run shelters, but little happened. The State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs admits as much, while adding that even most of the 13 charity-run shelters do not meet proper criteria.Zeynalova’s house is painted light green, with a garden and walls decorated with cartoon characters. It is now home to 60 women and children.The kitchen and classrooms are on the ground floor with offices for social workers and lawyers above. The women and children have dormitories on the second floor, while the attic has been converted into a play and activity zone. Zeynalova has moved her shelter five times over the years and there have been setbacks. Restrictions on foreign funding of charities and other organisations introduced in 2015 almost resulted in closure but Zeynalova borrowed money to buy land and build the first two floors. Then she put out a call for help on the shelter’s Facebook page.“One person brought bricks, another some sand, the third wood, and so on,” she says. “I sold my car and some stuff to pay the builders.” In September 2020, the shelter was completed.Now the International Organization for Migration pays staff salaries, while Zeynalova appeals for donations via Facebook for bills and food. She uses her own pension and the stipend she gets as the chairperson of Azerbaijan’s Foundation for Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking. Zeynalova was herself homeless for seven years, two of them on the streets with two children aged seven and six. After leaving her abusive husband, she lost all her money to fraud and then the roof over their heads was taken away when the friend the family had been staying with died.“We stayed at another friend’s house but one day he had guests and did not let us in until they left, “ she says. “We were outside in the cold, and my daughter asked if we would ever have our own lights on.” Zeynalova moved her family between the houses of friends and relatives and then they slept in hotel yards or the entrance halls of apartment blocks. Baku, on the Caspian Sea and licked by the khazri, a freezing wind from the north, is a cold city in winter. “One day the door of an entrance hall was not open, the wind was so strong that I hugged the children and howled,” she says. “I was so helpless. Those were hard times.” Her daughter Elnura, now 33, remembers all the entrances where they used to hide and the benches where they slept.“Once a man invited us to spend a night at his house,” she says. “My mother was scared, not for herself but for us. We barely survived. I could collapse from hunger.”While she was married, Zeynalova had been invited to a meeting of a women’s rights organisation but did not dare go. In 1998 she was given a job as project manager with the same group, dealing with domestic abuse. She slept in the office with her son, Khalid, but Elnura went to live with her grandmother in Ganja, 190 miles (300km) west of Baku. “They put two chairs together and slept on them until mum got her first salary and bought folding beds,” says her daughter, who would not see her mother for five years. By 2002, Zeynalova had saved enough for a flat and sent for Elnura. “For us, it was more than an apartment,” she says. “It was ours.” But it turned into more, becoming “Təmiz Dünya” (Clean World), providing shelter for victims of domestic abuse and in 20 years has grown to helping 650 women and children every year. “Not only did she get herself back on to her feet but she helped others. For me, she is an example of staying human. Even though she was striving to achieve everything by herself, she has kept this sense of humanity, her readiness to help,” says Elnura, a legal consultant for the shelter. Almaz Makhmudova, 44, turned up there last July. She suffered more than 20 years of assaults and insults until the day her husband was arrested over a stabbing and she took her chance to leave. She is especially grateful for the care of her children. “Once my husband hit my younger son, Aydin, and his chin fractured. Treatment is ongoing, although we need expensive surgery. Otherwise when he grows up, he will be disfigured. They found a good doctor and will also cover the costs.” There is a rehabilitation process for each newcomer and legal, psychological and medical assistance if needed.“Some are reluctant to talk, withdrawing into themselves,” says Yagut Mammedyarova, 61, a social worker who has been working with Zeynalova for 25 years. “Or, some say one thing during our first meeting and another during the following ones.”When trust is established and the woman feels stronger, she is helped to find a job. Afsana Hasanova, 30, started working in a grocery shop while staying in the shelter and fighting to have the courts order her husband, a gambling addict, to return her three children. She was successful at last and Hasanova was able to leave the shelter a couple of months ago and rent a flat nearby. “This shelter is the main reason I survived,” she says. “My mind was a blank sheet of paper when I appeared here. They gave me a chance to write on that paper again.” Ismayil Fataliyev, 34, is a multimedia journalist from Azerbaijan, working to develop civil society in his country In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

4/5/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further dampened the economic prospects for developing countries in east Asia and the Pacific, meaning lower economic growth and higher poverty in the region this year, the World Bank has warned. The Ukraine factor came on top of the existing risks that the region – home to 2.1 billion people and stretching from China to Papua New Guinea - has been facing in recent years. They included the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the financial tightening in the United States, and the pandemic resurgence amid China’s zero Covid policies. China, which accounts for 86% of regional output, is forecast to expand 5% in 2022, 0.4 of a percentage point less than the World Bank’s October estimate. But in the Bank’s downside scenario, the world’s second-largest economy could grow at just 4%. The report covers the economies of 23 developing countries in the East Asia and Pacific region but not those of developed countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore or Japan. Even before the war in Ukraine, Beijing had been tackling Covid shocks to its economy and dealing with existing vulnerabilities in its real estate sector. In last month’s annual political gatherings, China’s ruling Communist party set its GDP growth target at “around 5.5%” this year. In recent weeks, however, as the war in Ukraine continued to rage and Omicron led the country’s biggest city, Shanghai, to lock down, economists have expressed concerns. In its latest regional economic update, entitled Braving the Storms, the World Bank said that while commodity producers and fiscally prudent countries may be better equipped to weather external shocks, the repercussions of recent events will dampen the growth prospects of most in the region, which is projected to grow by 5% - down from its October estimate of 5.4%. But this is just the most-probable scenario, the Bank said. Growth may slow to 4% if global conditions worsen and national policy responses are weaker, it added. Countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines are all estimated to grow for over 5%, but a few percentage points less in the downside scenario. “The question is what the governments can do,” Aaditya Mattoo, Chief Economist of the East Asia and Pacific Region of the World Bank, told the Guardian. “These shocks are on top of existing challenges for the region’s economies, and the scope for both fiscal and monetary policies are shrinking, too.” Mattoo worries that such volatilities will have a concrete impact on millions of households in the region. Some eight million people in the region fell back into poverty line during the pandemic, and they will see real incomes shrink even further as prices soar and purchasing power decreases. The World Bank report warned: “Indebted governments, who have seen their debt as a share of GDP increase by 10 percentage points since 2019, will struggle to provide economic support. Increased inflation, at least 1 percentage point above previous expectations due to the oil price shock alone, will shrink room for monetary easing.” The succession of shocks means that the growing economic pain of the people will have to face the shrinking financial capacity of their governments, Mattoo said. “A combination of fiscal, financial and trade reforms could mitigate risks, revive growth and reduce poverty.” They include: 1) enhancing the efficiency of fiscal policy for recovery and growth; 2) strengthening macro-prudential policies to mitigate risks from global financial tightening; 3) reforming trade-related policies in goods and, especially, in still-protected services sectors, to benefit from the shifting landscape in global trade; and 4) reforming policy while encouraging diffusion of technology.",News/World news,"Ukraine war to slow economic growth and drive up poverty in Asia, World Bank warns",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/ukraine-war-to-slow-economic-growth-and-drive-up-poverty-in-asia-world-bank-warns
4/5/2022,"Australian unions have raised fears the Morrison government’s trade deal with India will fuel the growth of temporary, employer-sponsored migration – a trend they say leaves workers “highly vulnerable to exploitation”. The Australian Council of Trade Unions also slammed the failure to include a labour rights chapter in the pre-election agreement, arguing this “could contribute further to a race to the bottom on workers’ rights, wages and conditions”. The Australian government signed an interim trade agreement with India on Saturday, with most of the initial focus on immediate tariff cuts for Australian exports of lamb, wool and rock lobster. The government said the deal “opens a big door into the world’s fastest-growing major economy”. But Australia has also offered to provide new access for young people from India to participate in working holidays in Australia, with places set at 1,000 a year. Australia confirmed post-study work rights for Indian graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors. Indian students with a bachelor’s degree with first-class honours will be allowed to stay in Australia for three years after graduation, rather than the current two years. The president of the ACTU, Michele O’Neil, responded to the deal by saying unions supported permanent migration. She said the visa system “should support workers with skills that we need moving to Australia long term”. “Instead it has increasingly become a pool of exploitable labour for big business, which lobbies the government to remove protections,” O’Neil said. “The Morrison government continues to sign us up to trade agreements that facilitate the growth of temporary, employer-sponsored migration. These workers are highly vulnerable to exploitation because in many cases their ability to stay in this country is in the hands of their employer.” O’Neil also said the lack of a labour rights chapter was “a missed opportunity to use trade policy to raise living standards and help combat issues such as child labour”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under Australia’s work and holiday visa scheme, young people are eligible to stay for a second year only if they have completed at least three months of specified work – including fruit picking, tourism and hospitality roles in northern Australia. This work does not need to be with a single employer. The trade minister, Dan Tehan, said offering 1,000 places in Australia’s work and holiday program for young people from India each year was “expected to contribute to both workforce requirements and to tourism in the post-Covid recovery”. The agreement also allows for executives and service suppliers with advanced trade, technical or professional skills to transfer from India to Australia for up to four years, with the possibility of a further stay. But, importantly for Australian unions, the agreement makes clear that “labour market testing may be required” – meaning that employers are required to check first that the relevant skills are not available domestically. Despite these provisions being included in the interim deal, O’Neil raised concerns that the yet-to-be-negotiated broader free trade agreement “may end up waiving labour market testing”. She reiterated the union movement’s longstanding concerns about how free trade agreements are negotiated in secrecy in Australia, arguing “workers will only know its contents when it is too late to do anything”. “We need public oversight of this process, approval by parliament and accountability for the politicians who are signing away the rights of working people,” O’Neil said. Arguing the deal benefited both countries, Tehan said India would “provide a reciprocal work-based immigration route for Australians who successfully complete their studies and who wish to supplement their training with professional experience in India, to open up greater opportunities post-study”. India had also guaranteed that Australian suppliers of services in a number of sectors would have the highest level of market access even if future trade deals offered improved access to other countries, he said. India is Australia’s seventh-largest overall trade partner but attempts to diversify trade have taken on extra urgency given the increasingly rocky relationship with top-trading partner China. Sonia Arakkal, a policy fellow at the Perth USAsia Centre, said the relationship between Australia and India had gone from strength to strength in the defence and strategic fields over the past few years, “but the economic side of things hasn’t kept up”. Arakkal said the Australian government had a domestic political imperative to getting the deal signed before entering the formal election campaign period, when caretaker conventions would apply. She said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appeared to want to seal the deal prior to the election “as a feather in his cap” when campaigning with business and industry. “I think it’s fair to question whether there was a rush,” she said. Arakkal noted the Indian government also had a political imperative to secure “a good news story” in its relationship with a western partner and fellow Quad member, given the attention on its reluctance to condemn Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. She said the gains were “modest” for a number of Australian agricultural subsectors, noting dairy and chickpeas were excluded in the interim deal, and there were only small advances for the wine sector. Arakkal described it as “a trust building exercise” to pave the way for a full free trade agreement later. Some Australian wine industry figures have expressed disappointment. Pernod Ricard Winemakers – which produces Jacob’s Creek – said on Saturday the interim deal would “reduce tariffs on just 2% of Australian wine exports to India”.",News/Australia news,"Morrison government’s trade deal with India leaves workers at risk of exploitation, unions say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/morrison-governments-trade-deal-with-india-leaves-workers-at-risk-of-exploitation-unions-say
4/5/2022,"“Ihave failed him” is a confession that Amy Bloom utters more than once of her husband, Brian Ameche, in her courageous howl of a memoir. Spoiler alerts aren’t required to say that, ultimately, she does no such thing, even though ensuring that it’s so means making good on the ultimate pledge: helping her beloved kill himself. Assisted suicide is the preferred wording at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, to where she and 66-year-old Ameche will eventually travel from their Connecticut home in January 2020, in order for him to down a fatal dose of sodium pentobarbital. They’ll fly business class, paid for by her sister, but the truer journey there takes months and involves endless paperwork and administrative delays, obstructive medical professionals (“villains”, she deems them), and a slaying range of bittersweet emotions. Because braided with the backstory of their offbeat midlife romance is Bloom’s account of watching her spouse fall victim to one of the world’s most prevalent but least understood diseases: Alzheimer’s. The narrative flits back and forth in time as Ameche’s appointment in Zurich looms, and though never less than expertly crafted, this is a book whose temporal shifts can feel appropriately unmooring. Glancing over her shoulder, Bloom recognises that there were plentiful signs Ameche was suffering from dementia as long as three years previously: forgetfulness, abrupt lack of interest in activities he’d previously adored, subtle changes in his character and far less subtle changes in his handwriting. As haziness invades the architect’s once-keen brain, Bloom meets it with a willed fog of her own, desperate to minimise, normalise. Surely their trip to Zurich, she reflects, could seem “almost normal” – except that when Ameche wanders off to the newsstand, she holds her breath until he returns. Raising glasses to each other on the plane, they’d ordinarily have said “Cent’anni” – Italian for “May we have a hundred years” – but can’t bring themselves to, knowing full well that they won’t get to share a 13th wedding anniversary. Once he received his diagnosis in 2019, it took Ameche less than a week to reach a decision from which he wouldn’t waver. Not for him the “long goodbye” of dementia – better to die on his feet than live on his knees, he insisted. The trouble was, orchestrating his exit was already beyond him, and so began Bloom’s eerie internet trawling. She considered solutions involving turkey basting bags, the scoring of illegal drugs, and a futuristic suicide pod. An old pal from Ameche’s Yale football-playing days (the sport seems the likeliest cause of his illness) volunteered to shoot him if he could only wait a while. It wasn’t long before Dignitas emerged as the sole fully legal, pain-free option. “Every day is an up-and-down,” she writes of the long, conflicted weeks that follow as she works to convince the Swiss of her husband’s suitability. “Rollercoaster ride makes it sound thrilling; it is not thrilling. The ups and the down both hurt, it’s a mistake to scream, and nothing moves quickly.” Bloom at once dreads and desperately needs the green light from Dignitas, because the consequences of not getting Ameche there before he’s deemed incapable of a sound decision appal them both. Tears course through these pages leaving even phones “sodden”, and the couple nap frequently, “as if clubbed” (that verb says it all). Less expectedly, it’s also consistently funny. Very funny. Among those early warning signs? Wildly off-key gifts like jewellery suggestive of some “Seventies-boho, broke-ass mistress” or a $500 marled hoodie with tulle trim. “I’m still surprised that I didn’t look at that sweatshirt and think, I see that you have Alzheimer’s,” Bloom muses. Heartache makes her savvy and sarcastic, a tone she pairs with a memorable descriptive shorthand whose economy underscores the ticking clock at her narrative’s centre, and all the ambivalence that represents for her. Landing in Zurich, for instance, they check in to a room that’s “hotel-pleasant”. As a couple, they were always “stickily close”, and she craves “leaf-shaking” end-of-life conversations instead of listless chat. “Agony and tedium” are the words she’ll find written on an index card when she unpacks back at home. Her characterisation of Ameche before his illness, however, is full of life. Here he is, a large, good-humoured man adored by granddaughters and waiters alike, possessed of a working wardrobe best described as “gay Mafia hitman”. As well as being a novelist, Bloom is a psychotherapist, intimate with all things “shrinky” (her word), and yet she details her own feelings – her anguish and anxiety and exhausted irritation – with disarming immediacy. She dips, too, into the fraught ethics of euthanasia. “I worry, sometimes, that a better wife, certainly a different wife, would have said no,” she admits. In Love is her 10th book but first memoir, and she says in the acknowledgments that it has proven the most challenging of her career. (Bear in mind, too, that Covid lockdowns came into force very shortly after her solo return to the US.) It’s certainly profoundly personal and all the stronger for it, but she allows herself to take in the broader picture while venting. For starters, she’s angry with the red tape that makes a hard task harder, still less dignified. She’s angry at the fact that this “infinity pool” of a disease so disproportionately affects women, as sufferers and caregivers both. And of course, she’s really angry with other people for being alive when Ameche soon won’t be. Curiously, the nature of Alzheimer’s means that she is, in a way, being expunged too. “Sometimes now with Brian, I am worse than alone. I’m gone from his interior landscape. Not that I have been uprooted, but that I am not there, and never was. These moments are scorching,” she writes towards the end. But then she’ll hand him a cup of tea and he’ll smile and thank her and she’ll realise that it’s “just as scorching to be present”. The tea will invariably have a big spoonful of honey in it. If her humour – dark, stark but messily, warmly human with it – stems from a kind of survival instinct (coping mechanism is too pat), then the maternal nurturing that takes over, stopping her (mostly) from snapping over his chilly disengagement or their now-circuitous spousal bickering, feels equally elemental, equally fierce. When the time comes to head to the industrial park outside Zurich where Dignitas is based, Bloom allows the reader into the room with her. Much of the intensity of what is about to take place is captured by a single, simple question that Ameche asks: “What time’s your plane?” In the circumstances, how could it be anything other than unravelling? And yet she takes his hands, kisses his weary face. It’s of such modest seeming kindnesses that extraordinary acts of love are composed, this startling book teaches.

4/5/2022,"On Wednesday, the “no-fault divorce” law comes into effect in England and Wales, the result of years of campaigning by lawyers and family rights groups, to take the acrimony out of separation. The law until now was peculiar in ways that you probably wouldn’t realise until you were at the point of getting divorced – tethered to old-world values about the sanctity of marriage, with workarounds to reflect the modern understanding that, sometimes, shit happens. So if you wanted a divorce and hadn’t been deserted or gone through the process of separation, you had to sue your spouse for either adultery or unreasonable behaviour. In the first case, obviously that had to be brought by the “adulteree” rather than the adulterer, which was kind of rum, that one party would get cheated on and made to carry the burden of legal admin. As for what’s unreasonable, the bar was set incredibly low, and unless you said: “He has this way of breathing where it always sounds the same,” a judge would be unlikely to refuse you. It sounds easy, but it set the tone: two people scrabbling through the mud of the marriage to find the worst bits in it, which intensified the adversarialism. Even couples who managed to keep it “round the table” (a mediated separation) rather than head to head (with a family court involved) would nonetheless often be embarking on their journey as co-parents with a whole list of charges and counter-charges, burning away at their brains, offending their natural sense of justice. So “no-fault” feels like a magic bullet, yet fails at the level of language. It makes it sound like an entirely neutral event, containing neither intention nor emotion – it could be two drivers, innocently colliding as they both try to change lanes; or two robots, accidentally chasing each other off a cliff, after a motherboard malfunction. That’s not how most people feel about their divorce. It’s not always the letter of the law and the processes of the court forcing couples into hostile positions; often people can only make sense of what has happened with a painstaking analysis of its many unfortunate events. The phrase they’re looking for, if they want to take the sting out of the process, while still reflecting on its reality, is an “everybody’s-fault divorce”.

4/5/2022,"The number of people with Covid across the UK has hit record levels, figures released on the day England ended free testing suggest. One in 13 people in the UK were estimated to have Covid in the week ending 26 March, according to the Office for National Statistics, including a record 6.6% of over-70s. Four people speak about recently contracting Covid for the first time. After avoiding Covid for two years, 72-year-old Marie James became ill in March. She’s since developed painful mouth ulcers that make it impossible to eat solid foods, which a nurse said was a sign that Covid had lowered her immune system. During the week she caught the virus, she “did a series of things unusually”, including wearing her high-grade mask less strictly than usual. “I shan’t be doing that again. I lowered my guard a little, very much to my regret,” she says. “Though I don’t want to go everywhere with a mask on, I will have to.” James still has “one or two” tests at home. “If needed we’ll buy more. We’re lucky, we’ve got our pensions – it’s the people who can’t afford to do it,” she says. “Personally, I know they have to come to an end but people on benefits should be able to have them. If you can’t afford it, you’re not going to get a lateral flow test, are you?” David*, a 55-year-old office worker in Manchester, is one of those forced to make that choice. The father-of-two tested positive for the first time on 20 March. He still feels unwell – “I’ve got asthma, which is just making it a long road” – but having run out of lateral flow tests (LFTs), he is concerned his family may not know if they contract the virus. “If [my daughters and partner] get ill, I’ll be thinking, have I passed it on or have they got a cold?” he says. He’s also concerned about transmitting the virus to vulnerable people. “At least before, I could go online and order one … You follow advice for two years and then they cut you off at the knees.” Combined with the cost of living crisis, David is in a bind. “Do I heat the house, do I get food or do I get Covid tests? I get good food for the girls; I don’t want to get them cheap rubbish. That’s the choice we have.” “I had two weeks of a horrible illness but managed to avoid hospital,” says 39-year-old Jeremy, who is immunosuppressed because of the medication he takes for psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. “The shortness of breath really got to me but I monitored my oxygen saturation and it never dropped to dangerously low levels.” Jeremy, who lives in Oxfordshire and works in animation, says he thinks he caught Covid after a local home education get-together for his daughter in March. “Since September we’ve been home educating but started attending some primarily outdoor gatherings last month.” “We were more relaxed by this stage because I’d had four vaccines, and antivirals were now theoretically available to the immunosuppressed.” “Living with Covid does not work for people like me. I was ill and still struggling with breathlessness. Covid has shifted the landscape for vulnerable people significantly.” Seventy-year-old Clair Chapwell, from north London, says she’s “worried we’ll all be permanently sick”, with people testing less and being more relaxed about taking preventative measures against Covid. Chapwell, who is semi-retired, said she thinks she caught Covid travelling back from France last Tuesday. “We were masked up but people are so casual now,” she said. “My wife tested positive on Wednesday but I was negative. I had achy muscles and diarrhoea but thought it was something else. “On Sunday I tested positive using an LFT. My whole head is blocked.” She has a birthday party planned for Saturday but doesn’t think it will go ahead. “I’m testing every day but if I’m still positive we’ll have to reschedule. “I’m glad we went to France but maybe we took too many risks. Covid is unavoidable though. We’ve been very careful but you can’t live your life behind a mask or indoors.” *Name has been changed",News/World news,‘I lowered my guard’: four people on catching Covid for the first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/i-lowered-my-guard-four-people-on-catching-covid-for-the-first-time
4/5/2022,"More than 200,000 victims of Brazil’s worst environmental disaster are seeking compensation in a UK court this week, in one of the largest group claims in English legal history. The claimants, including representatives of Krenak indigenous communities, are fighting to get compensation for the devastation caused by the Mariana dam disaster in November 2015. The £5bn lawsuit is against the Anglo-Australian mining company BHP. When the Fundão tailings dam burst, it released 40m cubic metres of toxic mining waste, killing 19 people and affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands more. The brown, polluted sludge spilled down the River Doce in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, flowing for 400 miles (670km) into the Atlantic Ocean. Thousands were made homeless and livelihoods centred on the river were destroyed. This week’s court case is the culmination of a three-and-a-half year legal fight in the UK, with lawyers from the London-based international law firm PGMBM representing hundreds of thousands of individuals as well as 530 businesses, 150 members of indigenous communities, 25 municipalities and six religious organisations. PGMBM filed the lawsuit in 2018, and last July won the right to reopen the case after an earlier ruling denied jurisdiction for English courts to hear it. A representative of the Krenak indigenous communities in London said yesterday: “Every time that I remember what my family and my community has gone through, every time that I revisit the river, I become angry. “These times are a time of great struggle for my people, and I have made it my purpose to help us achieve fair compensation. Alas, I understand that no matter how hard we fight, much of what the companies have taken from our people is irrecoverable. For it to have been suggested by the defendants that my community is receiving full redress in Brazil makes me even angrier.” Tom Goodhead, managing partner of PGMBM, said: “BHP is a multinational that generates huge profits in the regions where it operates, and it is only right that the company … is held directly accountable at its headquarters. The days of huge corporations doing what they want in countries on the other side of the world and getting away with it are over. In Brazil, BHP, along with the Brazilian iron-ore mining company Vale, and Samarco, the joint venture company responsible for managing the Fundão tailings dam, established the Renova Foundation to mitigate the environmental consequences of the collapse and to provide compensation for individuals and some small businesses for loss and damages. By November 2021, Renova had spent more than 19.6bn Brazilian reals (£2.6bn) on environmental and economic reparations and rehabilitation projects, including R$7.78bn in compensation and financial aid to 359,000 people, according to the company. BHP had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The hearing is due to continue until Friday and will be heard by three senior court of appeal judges. It is being streamed on London’s court of appeal YouTube channel.

4/5/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are today’s top stories. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address the United Nations security council later today amid a growing international outcry about the apparent slaughter of civilians by retreating Russian forces around Kyiv. Joe Biden accelerated the international response to the shocking scenes reported from Bucha by calling for the prosecution of Vladimir Putin for war crimes. “This guy is brutal and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous,” the US president said of his Russian counterpart. Zelenskiy, who visited Bucha yesterday, said other towns such as Borodyanka could reveal higher death tolls, and added that Ukraine was preparing for “even more brutal” operations by Russian forces in the east and south of the country. The Kremlin has reverted to type and claimed photographs and videos of the carnage in Bucha and other towns have been faked by the west. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said yesterday that the west must not lift sanctions against Russia until all its troops had left Ukraine and Putin was unable to mount such an offensive again. Despite worldwide condemnation of Putin, it will be far from simple to ensure that the Russian president faces court. And the evidence of Russian brutality poses a test for the west as well because it is likely to increase pressure on Germany in particular to cut fuel imports from the east even more quickly. You can follow all the latest developments on this at our live blog, and catch up with what we know so far on day 41 of the invasion. Party problem – Senior civil servants are braced for criticism in Sue Gray’s report into lockdown parties in Downing Street after the government’s former ethics chief apologised for attending a party in breach of Covid gathering rules. The apology comes in the wake of a leak naming her as one of the people fined by police over Covid breaches. Helen MacNamara, who left the government last February to work at the Premier league, said sorry for her “error of judgment” in attending a leaving party in June 2020. Boris Johnson did not attend that party, but there remains speculation about whether he will be fined over lockdown parties at No 10. There is also consternation in Whitehall about how to deal with the fallout if senior civil servants are implicated as organisers of gatherings when the full report is finally published Countdown to market – The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, is pushing ahead with plans to privatise Channel 4, despite opposition from staff and media figures such as Sir David Attenborough. The government hopes to raise around £1bn from the sell-off, making it one of the biggest privatisations since Royal Mail went public a decade ago. Ministers have suggested they could spend the proceeds to boost creative training and independent production companies, essentially funding their levelling-up agenda. Here’s what you need to know about the plans, and the 40-year countdown to the privatisation. Landslide tragedy – A British man and his son have died after five members of the same family were caught up in a landslide while on a mountain walk on holiday in Australia. His wife and 14-year-old son will be operated on today after suffering critical injuries in the incident in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, on Monday. The couple’s 15-year-old daughter was treated for shock. Police said conditions in the mountains were “extremely unstable” after weeks of rain in the region. ‘Now or never’ – The world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a “now or never” dash to a low-carbon economy and society, scientists have said. Greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025, and can be nearly halved this decade, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to give the world a chance of limiting future heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The panel’s stark language makes it clear that it’s all over for fossil fuels if governments are to succeed, although the third part of its review of climate science says immediate action is needed. ‘Still in the womb’ – An enormous planet about nine times the mass of Jupiter has been observed at a remarkably early stage of formation in a discovery that challenges the current understanding of how planets are made. Astronomers in Hawaii who detected the planet – AB Aurigae b – have described it as “still in the womb” because it is at such an early stage of life. It lies 508 light years from Earth.

The mourning over the death yesterday at the age of 95 of June Brown, who played Dot Cotton in EastEnders, is a reminder of the part played by such characters in national life. Mikel Arteta rued the consequences of an “unacceptable” performance from his Arsenal side at Crystal Palace and admitted he had not anticipated anything like the 3-0 defeat that raises serious question marks about their top four hopes. A defiant Pep Guardiola has joked about “overthinking” the Champions League knockout stage in the past with “stupid tactics” but the Manchester City manager insists he will not change his approach. Virgil van Dijk has said Liverpool are intent on providing an “unforgettable” season and that their pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple should not be taken for granted. The American Bryson DeChambeau, who has not recovered from injuries to a hand and hip, is enjoying a lower profile in the build-up to this year’s Masters at Augusta. Gambling and betting companies will be banned from using advertising featuring top-flight footballers and other sports personalities, as well as reality TV and social media stars, under new rules designed to protect under-18s and other vulnerable groups. And from an impressive Chelsea defence to a Mancunian scrap for third, here are the major talking points from the weekend’s Women’s Super League action. A group of around 100 Tory rebels has forced Boris Johnson to back away from plans to build more onshore windfarms in favour of a big investment in nuclear power along with more offshore wind to fix Britain’s energy problems. Despite backing in cabinet from Kwasi Kwarteng and Michael Gove, the prime minister will outline his new approach in a policy launch this week in the face of opposition from ministers including Grant Shapps who has called onshore turbines “an eyesore”. FTSE100 futures are trading down slightly today, and the pound is on $1.311 and €1.194. The Mirror’s splash headline is in Russian but it is helpfully repeated in English underneath: “You need to know”, it says, calling it a “message to the Russian people” as the outcry over the Bucha killings continues to make the running on many front pages. The Times says “Britain calls for tougher sanctions on Russia”, while the Express leads on Zelenskiy’s visit to the scene: “Horrors of war shock hero of Ukraine”. The i says “Blood money: Europe split on funding Putin’s war” and the Scotsman has “Biden: ‘Putin should go on trial for war crimes’”. The Guardian also features the Ukraine president on the front but the main story is “‘It’s now or never’ if the world is to stave off climate disaster – IPCC”. The Telegraph has Telegraph “Channel 4 set to be taken private”, but the Yorkshire Post sounds a warning on the idea: “Channel 4’s sale ‘will cost jobs in North’”. The Mail leads with the equality commission’s ruling on trans issues – “Huge boost for women’s rights” – the Sun goes with “June Lit Up Albert Square” and the Record has “Holiday flight chaos”.

4/5/2022,"Worse atrocities than those discovered in Bucha are likely to be uncovered in other areas seized from Russian invaders, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned, ahead of his appearance at the UN security council on Tuesday. As he built support for an open investigation into the killings in Bucha, Zelenskiy said: “And this is only one town. One of many Ukrainian communities which the Russian forces managed to capture. Now, there is information that in Borodyanka and some other liberated Ukrainian towns, the number of casualties of the occupiers may be even much higher.” The town of Borodyanka lies 25km (16 miles) west of Bucha. The president accused Russia of trying to “distort the facts” about the alleged atrocities and claimed it was “already launching a false campaign to conceal their guilt in the mass killings of civilians in Mariupol”. “They will do dozens of stage interviews, re-edited recordings, and will kill people specifically to make it look like they were killed by someone else,” he said. “Probably, now the occupiers will try to hide the traces of their crimes. They did not do this in Bucha when they retreated. But in another area it is possible.” The scale of the killings around Kyiv is still unclear. Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova, has said 410 civilian bodies were recovered in the greater Kyiv area after Russian troops withdrew, while the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, said the town had buried 280 people in mass graves because its cemeteries were under fire. Zelenskiy, who visited Bucha on Monday, said there was information to suggest more than 300 people were killed and tortured there. Europe’s worst conflict in decades, sparked by Russia’s invasion on 24 February, has already killed 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates. The UN refugee agency said on Monday more than 4.2 million refugees had fled the country. Earlier, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said evidence of civilian killings in Bucha were just the “tip of the iceberg”. Speaking at a joint press conference with the UK foreign minister, Liz Truss, he said the “horrors of Bucha, Mariupol, and other places” demand “serious G7 and EU sanctions”. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday that Vladimir Putin and his supporters would “feel the consequences” of events in Bucha and that western allies would agree further sanctions against Moscow in the coming days. Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said new US sanctions against Moscow would be announced this week. The US State Department said it was supporting an international team of prosecutors and experts to collect and analyse evidence of atrocities. Biden has called for the Russian president to be tried for war crimes, saying: “We have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight, and we have to get all the detail [to] have a war crimes trial. This guy is brutal and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous.” The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was ready to send investigations teams to Ukraine to document alleged Russian war crimes and crimes against humanity. Russia has denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians and claimed it would present “empirical evidence” at the UN security council meeting on Tuesday to prove its forces were not involved. Russian forces pulled back from areas around the capital Kyiv in the face of unexpectedly lethal and mobile Ukrainian resistance using western anti-tank weaponry. Moscow painted the withdrawal as a goodwill gesture at peace talks, which last convened on Friday. Negotiators had been due to convene on Monday, but neither side has given an update on the talks. In other developments: The US stopped Russia paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600m from reserves held at American banks, in a move meant to eat into Moscow’s holdings of US dollars. The move would force Moscow to decide whether it would use dollars it has access to for payments on its debt or for other purposes, including supporting its war effort, a Treasury spokesperson said. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Kuleba, in a phone call on Monday, with Beijing again calling for talks to end the conflict. Wang said: “Wars end eventually. The key is how to reflect on the pain, to maintain lasting security in Europe and establish a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism.” Kuleba said they both shared “the conviction that ending the war against Ukraine serves common interests of peace, global food security and international trade”. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was stopped during an attempt to reach Mariupol to evacuate civilians, and is now being held in a nearby town, a spokesperson said. Germany expelled about 40 Russian diplomats in response to what its foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, called the Kremlin’s “unbelievable brutality” and “boundless will to exterminate” in Ukraine, and it temporarily took control of the Russian gas giant Gazprom’s German subsidiary to secure its energy supply. France later announced it was also expelling a number of Russian diplomatic personnel, saying their actions were “contrary to our security interests”. The US said it would ask the UN general assembly to suspend Russia from the body’s human rights council. “Russia’s participation on the human rights council is a farce,” Washington’s ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said. with Reuters",News/World news, Zelenskiy warns of worse atrocities yet to be uncovered in Ukraine as west vows more Russia sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/zelenskiy-warns-of-worse-atrocities-yet-to-be-uncovered-in-ukraine-as-west-vows-more-russia-sanctions
