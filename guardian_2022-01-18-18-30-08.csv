1/18/2022,"The BBC will be forced to axe some of its programming after being left with a £285m gap in funding from the two-year licence fee freeze, its director general has warned. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tim Davie said there was “no doubt” the freeze would affect the broadcaster’s frontline output.  He argued in support of a continued publicly backed model for the organisation, in the face of recent suggestions from the Conservative government that the future of its funding was up for discussion. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, confirmed on Monday that the BBC’s funding would be frozen for two years, remaining at £159 until April 2024, after which it would rise in line with inflation for four years. The announcement was made in a Sunday newspaper and on Twitter. Revealing the freeze would leave a £285m gap in funding, Davie said: “We are disappointed, we would have like to have seen an inflation rise throughout the period. We’ve got four out of six years and on we go. “I would say having certainty of income for six years – as you know the media market moving so fast – is very material to us. “Our estimate is – and just to set this clearly for everyone – by the year end 2027, the licence fee income will be about £4.2bn based on our assumptions around inflation, obviously guessing games around inflation are obviously difficult. We know this settlement … gives a £285m gap at the end of the period.” Davie warned the BBC was already “lean”, and while cuts were possible they would “affect our frontline output” – meaning losing programmes. “Inevitably, if you don’t have £285m, you will get less services, and less programmes. I still think the BBC can offer extraordinary value for the £13 a month and we absolutely think we can do that,” he said. When pressed further on the future of BBC Four, BBC Two and Radio 5 live, he added: “I think everything’s on the agenda.” When making the formal announcement in the House of Commons, Dorries watered down her suggestion that the licence fee would be abolished from 2028, raising suspicions that the focus of her provocative intervention on Sunday was to distract from Boris Johnson’s woes. Davie, who took up the role as director general in September 2020, said it was an “interesting way” to announce the real-terms cut and he had been of the understanding that negotiations were ongoing. “Clearly the pressures on household incomes are material, the government was clear that was a key factor when they made the announcement and we understand that,” he said. But Davie argued there should be a future for a publicly backed model of funding for the BBC and added that a subscription service – a model advocated by hard-right commentators – would not be the same. “Once you’re trying to serve a subscription base, it is a completely different situation,” he said. “Because suddenly you are there to make profit and make a return to a specific audience.” He added: “The debate is more centred around do we want a universal public service media organisation at the heart of our creative economy, which has served us incredibly well. If we want that we have to support a publicly backed and not a fully commercialised BBC.”",News/Media,BBC chief warns licence fee freeze will leave £285m funding gap,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/18/bbc-licence-fee-freeze-funding-gap-programmes-services-tim-davie
1/18/2022,"Ben Roethlisberger is lucky that football legacies are not decided by finales. If Sunday night was indeed Big Ben’s last ever NFL game, as he has strongly hinted, it wasn’t exactly a mic drop. In the 42-21 beatdown by the Chiefs, Roethlisberger struggled with rollouts, and lacked the creativity and finesse of his opposing number, Patrick Mahomes. Just as no one places too much weight on Dan Marino’s 62-7 playoff loss to the Jaguars in his career finale, Roethlisberger’s clunker of an ending won’t be a significant part of his story. But in comparison to Marino – or most other quarterbacks – Roethlisberger’s legacy is complicated.  His on-field success over an 18-season NFL career speaks for itself. Roethlisberger is a two-time Super Bowl winner and will one day be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Steelers haven’t suffered a single losing season with him under center. In turn, they’ve been a playoff staple – during Sunday’s loss Roethlisberger passed Joe Montana and Brett Favre for the third-most career passing yards in the playoffs. Injuries and age have taken their toll, and in recent years the team often won in spite of their quarterback rather than because of him. Roethlisberger in his prime, though, was an absolute marvel. With his signature pump fakes and ability to escape pressure, he had a habit of extending plays and converting first downs that didn’t seem possible … until they were. He wasn’t flashy like younger quarterbacks such as Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen. Nor was he a quarterback like Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers, who often seem five steps ahead of opposing defensive coordinators. He was just Ben. Gritty. Strong. Tough. While Roethlisberger’s farewell tour has come with incessant gushing from teammates, broadcasters and Steelers fans, the NFL world at large doesn’t have the same fuzzy feelings. Some of that is Roethlisberger’s personality. He’s surly and can be difficult with the media. He also has a history of publicly calling out teammates. But most of the hostility stems from Roethlisberger’s history with women. ESPN’s Brian Griese spent the majority of Week 18’s Monday Night Football broadcast talking up Roethlisberger as if were the Messiah. At one point, Griese paused his lovefest to channel his inner journalist and vaguely mention that Roethlisberger has “made some mistakes.” The first “mistake” occurred in 2008 when Roethlisberger was accused of sexual assault by Andrea McNulty, then an employee of a Lake Tahoe hotel and casino. McNulty said she was lured to his hotel room under the guise of fixing a broken television. Her complaint alleges that Roethlisberger blocked the door when she tried to leave. According to the lawsuit the quarterback grabbed her and then tried to kiss her. Roethlisberger denied the allegations and never faced any criminal charges. He reached an out of court settlement with McNulty in 2011. The NFL did not punish Roethlisberger. McNulty, on the other hand, was the recipient of backlash from those who did not like to think of their favorite quarterback as an alleged sexual assaulter. McNulty later suffered from depression. In 2010, another accusation surfaced when a 20-year-old college student in Georgia claimed that Roethlisberger assaulted her in the bathroom stall of a nightclub. Her complaint alleged that Roethlisberger’s bodyguard grabbed the woman’s arm and escorted her to a hallway where the quarterback was waiting with “his penis out of his pants.” She says he went on to rape her and a subsequent medical examination of the woman found “superficial laceration and bruising and slight bleeding in the genital area” although no semen was detected. The case was dropped after authorities cited insufficient evidence. Roethlisberger was questioned by just one police officer who coincidentally had asked Roethlisberger to pose for a photo earlier that night and allegedly later described the accuser as a “drunken bitch”. The NFL finally swooped in with a six-game suspension for violating the league’s personal conduct policy but later reduced it to four games for “good behavior.” Yes, an accused rapist received the same punishment from the league as Tom Brady for releasing air from footballs. Roethlisberger already had a history of reckless behavior, most notably when he crashed his motorcycle in 2006, suffering serious facial injuries. He was not wearing a helmet and it was reported that he did not have a valid license at the time of the crash. By the time of his suspension, many in the Steelers organization had tired of Roethlisberger’s behavior. One of the team’s other star players, receiver Hines Ward, said the NFL suspension was “justified”, adding: “When you’re in the quarterback position, everybody looks to you and there are certain situations you can’t put yourself in.” Since then Roethlisberger has stayed out of trouble. He married in 2011 and is a father of three. And he went on to win a lot more football games, an achievement that was more than enough for many fans to forget about his past. Roethlisberger is, of course, not the only alleged rapist to be embraced by his team’s fanbase. But there’s something especially difficult to swallow as we consider him as a player and person. When we consider that the quarterback is supposed to be the ultimate leader. From a talent standpoint, the Steelers have been lucky to have a future Hall of Famer under center for so many years. But the future Hall of Famer is far luckier that the actions he’s accused of didn’t ruin him. Roethlisberger was accused before Ray Rice punched his wife on camera and the league was forced to pretend it cares about its players’ behavior off the field. What if these accusations had come out during the more recent #MeToo movement? There are a variety of sliding doors scenarios that could have led to us bidding adieu to Big Ben years ago. But instead we’ve had 18 years of Roethlisberger – glorious for some, uncomfortable and infuriating for many.",Sport/Sport,"Ben Roethlisberger was easy to admire as a quarterback, but not as a man",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/ben-roethlisberger-pittsburgh-steelers-quarterback-nfl-sexual-assault-allegations
1/18/2022,"There can be no excuse for not knowing Olive Senior – who has recently taken over as poet laureate of Jamaica, where she was born (although she has lived in Canada for much of her adult life). Yet I have to admit that I had, unaccountably, not read her until now, and after days immersed in her splendid Hurricane Watch: New and Collected Poems, I have emerged with the sense of having met a life-enhancing person through the most beguiling poetry – filled with intransigent tropical gardens, singular birds and a keen social conscience. I cannot think of a better way to read your way into 2022. Olive Senior – the name itself nudging towards becoming a poem – has an inclusive attitude towards her work and never disdains humble things. She will give full, equal and affectionate attention to mango trees, magpies and even to a Christmas pudding (a recent, gorgeous poem, soaked in rum) as well as to global and racial injustice and environmental issues. There are playful, shaped poems here too: an egg about to hatch, a nutmeg charged with history, slanting rain. She is unlofty, humorously humane and I read her back-to-front, beginning at the end, focusing on her fine new work and later learning, by chance, how she has propped herself and readers up, internationally, during the pandemic.  Between May and September 2020, Senior produced Pandemic Poems: First Wave, what she describes as “a pandemic lexicon” (which she has since self-published), with each poem a “riff on a word or phrase trending through the period” – and it is worth perusing these. She makes no swanky claim for them, freely admitting that “what I needed to say was more important than the saying of it (which is not how I usually write)”. But readers on Facebook and Twitter were entranced and the poems have, however modest she is about them, been a runaway hit (or, in lockdown, a stay-put hit). In her preface, she marvels at the “instant call-and-response offered by poetry in the moment”, which, she suggests, “takes us back to the dawn of humanity”. She is keen to promote democratic, down-to earth writing in the West Indies and beyond, and to remind us that poetry is for everyone (to read and write) and can help in times of need. These coronavirus poems are slight, sympathetic and binding: about social distancing, contact tracing and (one of my favourites) desperate measures applied to the cutting of hair in lockdown. F for Flattening (the curve) is a reassuring mix of accepting what cannot be controlled and revelling in continuing wildness. Here, too, you get a tiny hint of her humour, the possibility that there is an absurdity attaching to our bumpy road. The Collected Poems, which start in 2007, are more evolved than the pandemic offerings but share the same atmosphere of staunch, warmly present empathy. A former journalist, Senior is a natural celebrator but is in no danger of idealising her beloved Jamaica or the world beyond. In her outstanding poem Dead Straight, she describes returning to Jamaica and finding the land disfigured by a “dead straight” highway for tourists; a pre-pandemic flattening of the curve. “Not a glimmer of the coastline as I try to make it home/to you through a forest of hotels as thick as thieves…” In this “new paradise”, she adds, “the only palms are greased”. But her triumph, here as elsewhere, is that although undeceived, she travels light and retains a gift for not taking life too seriously, which is, in itself, in our po-faced times, a serious undertaking. We have beaten nature down Exalted straightness. But somewhere, are things we can never control: Wildness always trying to break in. When and where, unnoticed for how long did this bump in the road emerge this curve that so urgently needs flattening now?  Hurricane Watch by Olive Senior is published by Carcanet Press (£25).

1/18/2022,"Abdullah*, 34, was a security guard for the British embassy, employed under contract by GardaWorld, and had a senior management role, looking after other locally employed embassy guards. He and about 180 colleagues had hoped to be evacuated to the UK at the end of August, but the evacuation was stopped by a bomb at the airport. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) made a clear commitment that all GardaWorld staff would be allowed to travel to the UK, but this has not happened. Afghanistan: the left behind The crowds fighting to get into Kabul airport for evacuation dispersed months ago, but while the scramble to leave Taliban-controlled Afghanistan became less visible when the last foreign troops left in August 2021, it got no less desperate. Since then, reprisal killings have regularly been reported from across the country, including dozens detailed in a recent report from Human Rights Watch.  For those still in Afghanistan, living in hiding or in permanent fear for months now, the dangers seem to be increasing as the options for escape narrow. The UK government has tightened rules for its ARAP visa programme for former employees. A second scheme offering a path to safety to a wider section of Afghans at risk was heavily promoted by the government but it only began operating this month, and there are no details of how individuals can apply. And while the Taliban have largely kept a promise to allow those with tickets and documents to fly out, Afghan passports are difficult to secure , visas are even more challenging, and flights are still prohibitively expensive. This series features the stories of those who are trapped, in Afghanistan or in limbo as they search for safe haven, fearing for their lives from Taliban attacks or through hunger because they cannot work. Emma Graham-Harrison  We’ve heard nothing from the Home Office or the FCDO and life is becoming very hard for everyone who worked for the British embassy. Surviving when there is no income and no work is very difficult. We’re still hoping we will get an email about evacuation plans, but we haven’t heard anything. The UK government is helping footballers and writers to leave the country, but there has been no help for us. We feel like we should be first in line because we risked our lives for the British government. It’s a huge disappointment for all of us. All of the guards from the French embassy have been evacuated; the German and Australian governments are still evacuating embassy staff now; the Canadian government has even evacuated the cleaners and carpenters; but the British embassy, which was one of the largest embassies in Kabul, has left us. We wonder why we’ve been forgotten. Do they see us as a threat to them? Most of us have already sold our possessions – televisions, carpets, everything – so that we’ve got money to buy food. People are out on the streets selling things every day, but you can’t get much for your things, you have to accept about 30% of the real value. I’ve sold our car, and have managed to get the landlord to halve our rent from $400 to $200 a month, and I’m lucky to have a brother in the UK who is able to send a bit of money to support us. But everything has become so expensive in the markets, the money won’t last long. One of the guards called me last week, crying, and said he had sold everything apart from the mobile he was talking on; he said he was keeping it so he could check for an email from the British government with news of an evacuation plan. We’re sending emails every day, but they just say: you have to wait. My daughter is four and a half, and should be going to nursery, but there’s nothing. We keep her and her brother, who’s two and a half, at home most of the time because it doesn’t feel safe to go out. If anyone found out I had worked for the British government it would be very dangerous; one of my former colleagues has already been badly beaten. We don’t leave the house very often now. A UK government spokesperson said: “The government will honour its commitments to resettle those British Council workers and GardaWorld employees who are at risk.” *The name has been changed for this article.",News/World news,‘We’ve been forgotten’: the British embassy security guard in Kabul,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/forgotten-the-british-embassy-security-guard
1/18/2022,"The AFL has “immoral form” and is “corrupting and compromising the sport” with deals such as its $25m sponsorship deal with cryptocurrency firm Crypto.com, Reverend Tim Costello of the Alliance for Gambling Reform has said. The AFL announced the five-year partnership on Tuesday, saying Crypto.com would be the official cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform for the AFL and the AFLW.  Crypto.com is a trading platform for cryptocurrencies, digital encrypted currencies that allow payments to be made without banks. It also offers pre-paid debit cards. The company already has deals with international sporting brands including Formula One and UFC. It will also run an advertisement featuring actor Matt Damon at the Super Bowl in February. The AFL’s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, said on announcing the deal that “cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is a dynamic and emerging industry, and the AFL is delighted to partner with Crypto.com to be at the forefront of the industry’s growth in Australia”. Costello, the Alliance for Gambling Reform’s chief advocate, said in theory there was a “bigger cake” with cryptocurrency than conventional gambling, which was an entirely “zero sum” game. But both were compromising the AFL’s integrity, he said. “The sport is meant to be a sport, and all these add ons just because they say they need the money, chip away at the integrity of the sport. “You are literally corrupting and compromising the sport with all these other alternatives.” Costello said the AFL’s history with sports betting made him “suspicious” about the new deal. “The AFL has really immoral form, utterly immoral form on this,” he said. “AFL clubs have got out of pokies, by and large, but the AFL hasn’t moved an inch on Sportsbet and saturation ads.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning David Glance, a cryptocurrency expert and University of Western Australia computer scientist said crypto companies were trying to gain legitimacy through various sponsorship deals. As the deal was announced, Crypto.com’s customer support account on social media was responding to complaints from multiple users that they had been kicked out of their accounts, with some of them saying they had lost money. “We have a small number of users reporting suspicious activity on their accounts,” the company tweeted. “We will be pausing withdrawals shortly, as our team is investigating. All funds are safe.” Some users responded claiming their accounts had been hacked and their money was missing. Podcaster Ben Baller said about $18,000 went missing from his account, then later said it had been returned. The chief executive of Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek, said no customer funds were lost. “The downtime of withdrawal [infrastructure] was [about] 14 hours – our team has hardened the infrastructure in response to the incident,” he wrote on Twitter. “We will share a full post mortem after the internal investigation is completed.” In a press release detailing the deal with the AFL, Marszalek said Crypto.com was “committed to investing in Australia”. “The AFL and AFLW are perfect platforms to associate ourselves with Australian sports and culture,” he said. Glance said it was “strange” for sporting organisations to become involved in cryptocurrency, although less so when one considered they are often also involved with gambling companies. “Someone in the AFL thought this was a good idea, but I don’t think they’ve thought it through,” he said. “[Cryptocurrency] is an environmental catastrophe and it’s fuelling crypto crime. The people benefiting from this are doing it at the expense of people who lose money, and the environment.” It is estimated that “mining” cryptocurrency uses so much computer power that it burns more energy than entire countries. Guardian Australia revealed earlier this week that Australia’s financial security agency, Austrac, had concerns about a rise in crime as the use of cryptocurrencies increases. Cryptocurrencies are also often criticised for having no underlying value and relying on new investors to deliver returns to existing investors. The AFL and Crypto.com have been contacted for comment.",Sport/Sport,"AFL ‘corrupting the sport’ through deal with cryptocurrency trading company, says Tim Costello",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/afl-corrupting-the-sport-through-deal-with-cryptocurrency-trading-company-says-tim-costello
1/18/2022,"Pay for workers in Britain has fallen in real terms for the first time in more than a year, despite signs that employers shrugged off concerns over the Omicron coronavirus variant to continue hiring in December. Average wages, after taking account of inflation, dropped in November for the first time since July 2020 amid growing concerns over the hit to living standards this year from high inflation and surging energy bills.  The Office for National Statistics said although average total earnings grew at an annual rate of 4.2% in November, the impact from soaring rates of inflation meant workers suffered a 0.9% real-terms cut in their pay packets. The official rate of inflation reached a 10-year high of 5.1% in November. The number of employees on UK company payrolls rose by 184,000 on the month to 29.5 million, an increase of 409,000 on pre-pandemic levels as the jobs market continues to recover from Covid-19. Reflecting staff shortages across the economy, the number of job vacancies rose for most industries over the three months to December to a record 1.2 million despite a slowdown in the rate of growth in recent months. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “While it’s good to see employment continuing to rise, on pay it’s the same story of a squeeze on workers. “Working people deserve a decent standard of living and a wage they can raise a family on. But instead, following the worse pay squeeze for two centuries, real pay is falling, and they now face a cost-of-living crisis.” Official figures for the three months to November showed the unemployment rate continued to fall, dropping to 4.1%, close to where it was before the pandemic began in spring 2020. The redundancy rate, which measures the number of people being made redundant for each 1,000 employees, dropped to the lowest level on records dating back more than a quarter of century despite the government removing the furlough scheme at the end of September. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the latest figures were “proof that the jobs market is thriving”. “From traineeships for young people to sector based work academies for those switching careers, our plan for jobs is continuing to create opportunity for all,” he said.",News/Business,UK workers’ pay rises fall behind inflation amid cost-of-living crisis  ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/uk-workers-pay-rises-inflation-unemployment-covid
