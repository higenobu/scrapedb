The social-media company is set to announce its earnings on Thursday. Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF dumped 3.66 million shares of Twitter on Monday, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF sold more than 280,000 shares, according to the asset manager’s daily trading updates. That amounted to about $142 million based on Monday’s closing level. The selling comes amid a mixed set of results from its social-media peers. Facebook’s parent Meta Platforms Inc. suffered biggest one-day crash in stock-market history last week as its user base stopped growing while Snap Inc. jumped most ever after giving a quarterly sales forecast that topped Wall Street’s projections. ARK has been selling Twitter shares almost every week since late December and its sales have picked up pace this month. Apart from Monday, ARK sold more than 2 million shares of Twitter on Feb. 3 and more than 700,000 shares on Feb. 2. The firm’s daily trading updates show only active decisions by the management team and do not include creation or redemption activity caused by investor flows. Wood’s oft-repeated mantra is that ARK invests with at least a five-year time horizon, and that volatility in their equity picks is expected. ARK’s flagship fund has struggled in the past year after advancing nearly 150% in 2020, after investors started dumping pricey tech stocks and switching to cyclical firms expected to be bigger beneficiaries of an economic recovery.

2/9/2022,"With the US labor market getting tighter and employees changing jobs or quitting in droves, Amazon has made a big move to become more competitive. The company has boosted its maximum base pay from $160,000 to $350,000, in response to what it calls a ""particularly competitive labor market,"" The Washington Post has reported. In a recent Amazon Web Services (AWS) blog, the company said that it pays around 50 to 65 percent of ""what 'the market' will pay you."" By contrast, it noted that Microsoft paid 75 percent, Google 95 percent and Netflix ""top of market."" Until now, anything more than $160,000 at Amazon was instead compensated by stock or cash signing bonuses. This past year has seen a particularly competitive labor market and in doing a thorough analysis of various options, weighing the economics of our business and the need to remain competitive for attracting and retaining top talent, we decided to make meaningfully bigger increases to our compensation levels than we do in a typical year. According to Amazon's own information, the company's maximum base pay is now also at the top market level, or more. It's also increasing overall compensation for most jobs around the world, with increases ""much more considerable than we've done in the past,"" it wrote. At the same time, it's keeping the alternate compensation options, like stock options and signing bonuses, according to GeekWire. The change comes as Amazon's stock options become perhaps less interesting, considering that its share prices are down 15 percent from their peak in July 2021. Potential employees, especially top candidates who have their pick of tech companies, may have noticed that as well.",Business/Engadget•5 hours ago,Amazon more than doubles base pay for corporate and tech employees,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-more-than-doubles-base-pay-for-corporate-and-tech-employees-104600027.html
