4/16/2022,"A 550-ton bridge in India was stolen by a gang of thieves, per the news agency Asian News International (ANI). The men dismantled the bridge in broad daylight, ANI reported. Two government employees and a local politician were later arrested, according to The Times of India. A gang of thieves stole a 60-foot long, 550-ton bridge in northeastern India for its lucrative scrap value, according to the Indian news agency Asian News International (ANI). Police have arrested eight men, including two government employees, a police official said, per ANI. ""We have arrested eight persons, including an SDO (subdivisional officer) of the water resources department, in connection with the theft of the bridge,"" said Rohtas's police superintendent Ashish Bharti, per ANI. ""The thieves stole the bridge in connivance with the SDO. We have recovered one JCB, stolen iron channels weighing about 247 kg, and other material,"" Bharti continued. The iron bridge across the Ara-Sone canal in Bihar, which was in a state of disrepair after being out of use since the early 2000s, was dismantled over three days from April 3, BBC News reported. The gang wore government uniforms to avoid suspicion while working in broad daylight from 7 am daily, using cutting torches and excavators to tear it apart, BBC News said. People in the village of Amiyavar were oblivious to the theft, the media outlet reported. ""No one suspected it was a heist,"" local journalist Jitendra Singh told the BBC. In fact, the media outlet reported that some villagers were happy that the disused bridge was finally being removed. A phone call to the irrigation department on April 5 by Pawan Kumar, a man from a nearby villager, was what alerted the police to the crime. Kumar reached out to local officials to ask why procedures were not being followed concerning the removal of the bridge, BBC News reported. Police then launched an investigation and carried out raids after realizing that authorities had not issued an order for the bridge to be dismantled, the media outlet said. Eight people were arrested, including government workers and a local politician. Radhe Shyam Sing, a sub-divisional officer, was arrested, per The Times of India as was Arvind Kumar, who worked part-time for the irrigation department and told passers-by that the work had an ""official sanction,"" according to the BBC. Also among those arrested was Shivkalyan Bhardwaj, a block-level leader of the Indian socialist party Rashtriya Janata Dal, The Times of India reported. Four of the other arrested men worked in the scrap metal industry. Selling scrap metal to illegal factories can be a highly profitable business in India, according to Reuters.

4/16/2022,"By Philip Pullella ROME (Reuters) - A Ukrainian and a Russian woman took part in Pope Francis' Good Friday ""Way of the Cross"" service, but the meditation they wrote was scrapped after Ukrainians protested, saying the war made it inopportune. The traditional Via Crucis procession at Rome's Colosseum had become embroiled in controversy earlier this week when the programme showed that the two friends, a nurse and a student nurse at a Rome hospital, would take part. The candlelight service consists of the 14 Stations of the Cross, stages between the condemnation of Jesus to death and his burial. It is often customised so that those who carry the cross from one station to the next reflect world events. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, head of Ukraine's Byzantine-rite Catholic Church, called their inclusion inopportune and ambiguous because it did not ""take into account the context of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine"". The original text of the meditation the two women had written spoke of death, loss of values, rage, resignation, and reconciliation despite bombings. Shevchuk said the text, which had been approved by the Vatican, was ""incoherent and even offensive, especially in the context of the expected second, even bloodier attack of Russian troops on our cities and villages"". Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, also expressed his unease. On Friday night, the original text of some 200 words was replaced with two sentences: ""Faced with death, silence is the most eloquent of words. Let us all paused in silent prayer and each one pray in their hearts for peace in the world"". The crowd of several thousands people then fell silent for about as long as it would have taken to read the original, longer meditation. Francis sat and watched the procession sitting on white chair. In his own final prayer, he asked God to allow ""adversaries to shake hands so they can taste mutual forgiveness, to disarm the hand raised by a brother against a brother, so that concord can spring from where there is now hate."" Since the war began, Francis has only mentioned Russia explicitly in prayers, such as during a special global event for peace on March 25. But he has made clear his opposition to Russia's actions, using the words invasion, aggression and atrocities. Moscow calls it actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" designed not to occupy territory but to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Francis has implicitly rejected this definition. The War in Ukraine is expected to continue to cast a shadow over the pope's remaining Holy Week activities. On Saturday evening Francis will lead an Easter Vigil Mass in the basilica. On Easter Sunday, the most important day in the Christian liturgical calendar, he will say Mass in St. Peter's Square and then deliver his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message and blessing.
