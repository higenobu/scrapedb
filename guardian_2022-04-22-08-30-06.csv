4/22/2022,"Technology companies must be reined in to address the “weakening of democratic institutions around the world”, Barack Obama said Thursday, in a sweeping keynote speech on the perils of disinformation. Speaking at Stanford University in Silicon Valley, the former president made his most extensive remarks yet about the technology landscape, which he said is “turbo-charging some of humanity’s worst impulses”. “One of the biggest reasons for the weakening of democracy is the profound change that’s taken place in how we communicate and consume information,” he said. The address came as Obama has increasingly focused his post-presidential messaging on misinformation and what should be done about the largely unchecked power wielded by big tech. On Thursday, he solidified those calls, endorsing specific legislation. “Do we allow our democracy to wither, or do we make it better?” Obama asked. “That is the choice.” Obama’s speech called attention to the grave impacts of disinformation and misinformation – including manipulation of the 2016 and 2020 elections and the rise of anti-vaccination sentiments. He was candid about regrets he had surrounding Donald Trump’s election, saying his administration had long known that Russia had incentive to manipulate US democracy but he underestimated the effectiveness of the efforts. “What still nags at me is my failure to appreciate at the time just how susceptible we had become to lies and conspiracy theories,” Obama said. A Senate panel report in 2020 found conclusively that Russia had interfered in the 2016 elections to sway votes in favor of Trump, echoing findings from a prior report published by the Department of Justice. In addition to impacting the results of those elections, disinformation and misinformation has also caused many Americans to reject the results of democratically sound elections, Obama said – noting that the majority of Republicans doubt the legitimacy of Biden’s 2020 win. Much of these issues can be attributed to a decline in media literacy, the erosion of local news sources, and an “information overload” as we come into contact with limitless content each day. “The sheer proliferation of conflict and the splintering of information and audiences has made democracy more complicated,” Obama said. Obama took aim at the business models at the heart of big tech firms, noting that “inflammatory content attracts engagement” and that “the veil of anonymity platforms provide” make it easier to spread misinformation. He said while rising industry standards are helpful, solid regulation is needed to address social media companies’ business models and the way they design their products. “These companies need to have some other north star other than just making money and increasing market share,” Obama said. In particular, Obama addressed the frequent refrain of tech companies that their algorithms are proprietary business secrets, saying they have become “too guarded” and “need to be subject to some level of public oversight and regulation”. To do so, Obama endorsed the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, a bill introduced by US Senators Chris Coons, Amy Klobuchar and Rob Portman that would require social media companies to share certain platform data and allow vetting from independent researchers. He also called for reform of Section 230, a law that shields platforms from legal liability for content posted on their sites, saying that “wholesale repeal is not the answer” but “we need to consider reforms” to the measure. “As the world’s leading democracy, we have to set a better example. We should be at the lead on these discussions internationally, not in the rear” Despite dire warnings about the imminent crumbling of democracy under the disinformation epidemic, Obama called for a return to the hope present in the early days of big tech. “Today’s social media has a grimness to it,” he said. “We’re so fatalistic about the steady stream of bile and vitriol that’s on there. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, if we’re going to succeed, it can’t be that way.” Obama’s tone harkens back to an age of tech before the 2016 elections shook the world’s faith in companies like Facebook. His own presidency took place at a time when social media was still thought of as a force for good – stoking democratic revolutions like the Arab Spring. His election in 2008 is also largely thought of as one of the first to be fueled by grassroots social media campaigns – with supporters of Obama having been significantly more engaged online than those of McCain. Obama said at the time there was “a certain joy of finding new ways to connect and organize”. “Social media is a tool. At the end of the day, tools don’t control us, we control them,” Obama said. “It’s up to each of us to decide what we value and then use the tools we’ve been given to advance those values.”",News/US news,Obama targets disinformation and big tech regulation in Stanford speech,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/obama-stanford-speech-big-tech
4/22/2022,"While their team was unconvincing and a little bit lucky in their midweek draw with Leicester and the win against Manchester United that preceded it, Everton fans will not care too much how their players perform, or how many goals go in, as long as they can keep hoovering up enough points to keep them ahead of Burnley in the table. On Sunday they make the short trip to Anfield and, given the respective recent performances of themselves and their hosts, it is difficult to envisage anything other than an emphatic Liverpool win. But this is a derby, albeit one where form only very occasionally goes out the proverbial window. While it seems impossible to make a case for Everton derailing Liverpool’s title hopes while taking a further step towards safety by snatching even a single point, far stranger things have happened. BG Liverpool v Everton, Sunday 4.30pm (all times BST) There seems no end of Liverpool players determined to lead them to the title as they peak at the right time. Manchester City, however, have looked tired in recent times and are need of an individual saviour to keep them at the top. After 53 frustrating minutes at the Etihad on Wednesday, it was Kevin De Bruyne who lifted his team and the crowd, collecting a pass on the halfway line before holding off overzealous Brighton midfielders and, via a few ricochets, getting a ball through to Riyad Mahrez to open the scoring. It was a goal of pure quality against a side operating as Atlético-lite following fine wins at Arsenal and Spurs. The Belgian’s absence from the FA Cup semi-final starting XI was noticeable in a match City struggled to get any foothold in. Pep Guardiola will need to manage his talisman’s ankle issues carefully with the Premier League and Champions League trophies still up for grabs. Losing him for any of the run-in could gift their rivals a season-defining advantage. WU Manchester City v Watford, Saturday 3pm This match should have been a shootout for fourth. As it is, both sides have been turning up to gunfights armed with knives – often plastic ones from Pret. Manchester United have twice gone missing on Merseyside in recent weeks, while Arsenal went through a phase of losing to anybody from south of the Thames. After emerging from that slump by battering Chelsea, they should be able to repeat the trick here – though a paradox of United’s sorry season is the way they’ve racked up points against their immediate rivals, beating Spurs and West Ham twice each and Arsenal once. The reverse fixture, which ended 3-2 to United, came during the brief tenure of Michael Carrick, the most successful of United’s three managers in 2021-22. Ralf Rangnick, their worst for 40 years by win percentage, will at least have Cristiano Ronaldo back from compassionate leave. His players have yet another new manager to impress, now that the hottest seat in English football has gone to Erik ten Hag. TdL Arsenal v Manchester United, Saturday 12.30pm A five-game losing streak did for Dean Smith’s tenure at Aston Villa, a November defeat at Southampton proving the straw that broke the camel’s back after consecutive losses against Spurs, Wolves, Arsenal and West Ham. By a spooky coincidence, Smith’s replacement has now lost four in a row against Spurs, Wolves, Arsenal and West Ham (albeit in a different order). While there is no suggestion Steven Gerrard’s job is under threat, he could be forgiven for feeling twitchy as he takes his side to Leicester in a bid to arrest this alarming slide. With Emi Buendía likely to miss out with a shoulder injury, Ashley Young will probably fill in and Gerrard could ring other changes. Ezri Konsa had an extremely torrid time in their most recent reverse against Tottenham and may be dropped for Calum Chambers, while one of the misfiring Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins may also start on the bench. BG Leicester v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm West Ham’s stirring progress in Europe has come at a price: in their past six league games they’ve gathered only seven points, which makes them as bad as Manchester United. Their recent record at Stamford Bridge is feeble, with only one win since 2002 – but David Moyes has had a whole week to prepare for this game, unlike Thomas Tuchel. There may also never be a better time to visit the Bridge, where Chelsea have fallen apart three times in a row – losing 4-1 to Brentford, 3-1 to Real Madrid and 4-2 to Arsenal. When these sides met in December, the Hammers came from behind twice to win 3-2. And if Bukayo Saka can run rings round Chelsea’s defenders, Jarrod Bowen will fancy his chances too. TdL Chelsea v West Ham, Sunday 2pm Signed by Antonio Conte for Inter in 2020 after seven years at White Hart Lane, Christian Eriksen will get to renew several acquaintances when Tottenham pitch up at the Brentford Community Stadium. The Danish midfielder has been in outstanding form since regaining full fitness, and is unlikely to do his former manager or teammates any favours. Brentford are seeking a fourth league win on the bounce, with their playmaker enjoying his new lease of life and pulling the strings in midfield. Spurs will arrive in west London after their home defeat to Brighton, a game in which Graham Potter’s players nullified Harry Kane’s presence by doggedly preventing his teammates finding him with the ball. It will be intriguing to see if Brentford, coached by the similarly astute Thomas Frank, adopt a similar or identical approach. BG Brentford v Tottenham, Saturday 5.30pm So impressive in so many ways, Brighton have one curious weakness: they are the kids who behave beautifully in other people’s houses and then give their parents the run-around at home. Of their 40 points this season, only 15 have been won at the Amex Stadium. In the home table they stand 18th, with just 10 goals – fewer than anyone else. Since they last saw their own crowd, Brighton have pulled off a pair of crafty heists at Arsenal and Spurs before being flattened, more predictably, by Manchester City. Graham Potter’s elegant ball-players will need to be switched on for the south-coast derby: Southampton are breathing down their necks, three places below them in 13th but only one point behind. TdL Brighton v Southampton, Sunday 2pm Is a commendable performance in an away defeat against a desperately underperforming team, currently elite only in status and reputation, one to be proud of? It is a philosophical conundrum many Norwich fans may have wrestled with since their 3-2 reverse at the hands of Manchester United last time out. While there is no disgrace in losing by the odd goal of five at Old Trafford, Norwich’s hosts were far from convincing and have rarely seemed more vulnerable than at present. A repeat performance against Newcastle would give the Carrow Road faithful some much-needed succour, but further improvement will surely be needed. Eddie Howe’s resurgent side currently look far more United than their counterparts from Manchester. BG Norwich v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm In their first season under Bruno Lage, Wolves have quietly improved from a nightmare start. Sitting comfortably in eighth, with an eight-point cushion to Leicester below, they have been able to play “grandmother’s footsteps” and creep up on West Ham and Manchester United. With 15 league wins under their belt already, Wolves need only two more to reach their highest tally in the top flight since 1979-80, when Willie Carr, Andy Gray and company finished sixth. They have still to play Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, but their other games look winnable: Brighton, Norwich and first of all Burnley who, despite responding well to the sacking of Sean Dyche, still have a 45% chance of the drop according to the analysts at FiveThirtyEight. TdL Burnley v Wolves, Sunday 2pm It will have been 16 days since Leeds played when they take to the field at Selhurst Park on Monday night. No one at Elland Road will be complaining – many will have felt the need to reenergise after the end of the intense Marcelo Bielsa era, while extra time on the training pitch with the new manager, Jesse Marsch, can only help the squad absorb the American’s ideas going into the latter stages of the campaign. It will have also given Marsch time to evaluate everything that has happened in the past two months. Leeds are five points clear of the drop; victory on Monday night would leave them almost safe for another season, and allow Marsch to plan long-term for the first time since arriving in England, focusing on how Leeds need to improve over the summer in terms of personnel and tactics.

4/22/2022,"The Co-op is removing use-by dates from its own-brand yoghurt in an attempt to address the problem of millions of pots that are still safe to eat being wasted each year. Instead, starting next month, the Co-op’s own yoghurts will carry a best-before date, with shoppers encouraged to “use their judgment” to gauge if they are edible. About 42,000 tonnes of yoghurt – £100m worth – is thrown away in British homes each year because it is out of date, according to the food waste charity Wrap. Half are dumped in unopened packs. Nick Cornwell, the Co-op’s head of food technical, said the “acidity of yoghurt acts as a natural defence. We’d encourage shoppers to use their judgment on the quality of their yoghurt if it is past the best-before date,” he said. “Yoghurt can be safe to eat if stored unopened in a fridge after the date mark shown, so we have made the move to best-before dates to help reduce food waste.” The average family with children bins 244kg of food, or 580 meals, each year, with the total bill for this waste being £730. For an individual, the estimated waste figure is 69kg, which adds up to £210. This waste is bad for the planet because about a third of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions are associated with our food and drink. While use-by dates are about safety, and applied to foods that go off quickly and could cause food poisoning, best-before is an indicator of quality. Food is still safe to eat after this date but the flavour and texture may not be as good. Use-by dates are often found on products, such as milk and yoghurt, where a best-before one might do, a practice blamed for contributing to food waste. Things are starting to change, however. Morrisons recently switched to best-before dates on its milk, encouraging customers to use the “sniff test” to judge if it is OK. The “look, smell, taste, don’t waste” campaign, run by food waste app Too Good to Go, has so far enlisted 40 brands, including big names such as Nestlé, Danone and Onken. The companies involved have switched from use-by to best-before dates on products, including milk, yoghurt and cheese. “We know that the date label on yoghurt is a fundamental reason that it is wasted at home,” said Catherine David, Wrap’s director of collaboration and change. “Applying a best-before date helps give people the confidence to use their judgment to eat beyond a best-before date and use more of the yoghurt they buy.” The Co-op said the dates would start to change over next month with the switch due to be completed by the autumn.",News/Business,Co-op to ditch use-by dates on its yoghurt to cut waste,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/co-op-to-ditch-use-by-dates-on-its-yoghurt-to-cut-waste
4/22/2022,"Fears that Britain is heading for a marked slowdown in consumer spending have intensified as it emerged that the public is gloomier about the economy than when banks were on the brink of collapse during the financial crisis of 2008. A combination of rocketing energy prices, higher taxes and a surge in the annual inflation rate to its highest level in three decades meant confidence was in freefall, according to the latest monthly snapshot of sentiment. Labour called on Rishi Sunak to do more to address the cost of living crisis after all five measures of consumer confidence tracked by the polling firm GfK recorded sharp falls in April – a month that saw the raising of the energy price cap and an increase in national insurance contributions. Abena Oppong-Asare, shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: “These concerning figures sadly come as no surprise, given families are seeing the double whammy of an enormous Tory tax hike and soaring energy bills.“Collapsing consumer confidence shows how the cost of living crisis is weighing down growth. How many warnings like this does the chancellor need to grasp the seriousness of the cost of living crisis?” The report found the public more pessimistic about their own finances, the state of the economy and their willingness to spend money on big ticket items such as cars. The headline consumer confidence index – a combination of the five individual measures – dropped by seven points to -38 in April. A year ago the figure was -15. Joe Staton, the client strategy director at GfK, said: “The cost crunch is really hitting the pockets of UK consumers and the headline confidence score has dropped to a near historic low. “The scores looking at the next 12 months for our personal finances at -26 and the general economy at -55 are worse than the 2008 financial crash. The personal finance score for the next year is also worse than the initial Covid shock in 2020. “When rising inflation and interest rates meet low growth and declining incomes, consumers will understandably be extremely cautious about any spending. There’s clear evidence that Brits are thinking twice about shopping, as seen in the tumbling major purchase index – now is not considered to be a good time to buy. This is dire news for consumer confidence and with little prospect of any economic relief on the horizon we can only forecast further falls in the index for the year ahead.” A separate survey by the consultancy firm KPMG found a third of consumers had been spending less during 2022, with particularly sharp drops in clothes shopping and eating out. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at the consultancy firm Oxford Economics, said: “We shouldn’t be surprised if GDP falls in the second quarter given the likely impact of the extra bank holiday [for the Queen’s platinum jubilee] and the loss of support from Covid testing. But talk of a UK recession looks premature, not least because there will be a mechanical rebound in the third quarter, because it will have a full quota of working days. Still, the intensifying squeeze on household finances mean the UK economy is in for a bumpy ride through the rest of 2022.”",News/Business,UK consumer confidence even lower than in 2008 financial crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/uk-consumer-confidence-even-lower-than-in-2008-financial-crisis
4/22/2022,"Doctors in the UK have called for urgent new treatments to clear persistent Covid infections after identifying the first person in the world known to have harboured the virus for more than a year. The patient, who had a weakened immune system, caught the virus in 2020 and tested positive for Covid for 505 days before they died. Previously, the longest known PCR-confirmed case of Covid was a US cancer survivor in her 40s who tested positive for 335 days. Researchers at King’s College London and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust followed nine patients with persistent Covid to see how the virus evolved over the course of their infection. All of the patients had weakened immune systems due to organ transplantation, HIV, cancer or therapies for other illnesses. The infections typically persisted for 10 weeks or so, but two patients had the virus for more than a year. In addition to the patient who was infected for 505 days, a second has so far tested positive for 412 days and may exceed the 505-day record at their next follow-up appointment. Last summer, doctors in Bristol revealed that a 72-year-old patient, Dave Smith, had tested positive for nearly 10 months. Patients with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to long-running Covid infections. In the latest study, four of the nine patients died, with Covid contributing to perhaps a third to half of those deaths. Persistent infections may also be a source of new Covid variants because the virus acquires fresh mutations as it evolves in the patient. “These individuals seem to have a very poor outcome when they have persistent infection,” said Dr Luke Blagdon Snell, a clinical research fellow at Guy’s. “There’s an imperative to develop better treatments to clear infections for the patient’s own benefit. It may also have the added benefit of preventing the emergence of variants, but that is not yet clear.” Genetic analyses revealed that in five of the nine patients, the virus acquired at least one mutation found in the variants of concern that are prone to drive major waves of disease. The virus obtained from the patient who was infected for 505 days carried 10 mutations that arose separately in several major variants including Alpha, Gamma and Omicron. Many scientists suspect that some variants of concern, such as Alpha, arose in patients with persistent infections, but other sources of new variants are possible, such as animals that contract the virus and then pass it back to humans. Snell said none of the mutated viruses found in the study’s patients appeared to have spread beyond the infected individuals. One patient in the study is likely to have had a rare “occult” infection, meaning they tested negative on PCR for Covid despite having an ongoing infection. After falling ill with the Alpha variant in 2021, the patient’s symptoms subsided and they tested negative several times, but later saw the Alpha variant bounce back and cause further symptoms, despite the variant no longer being present in the UK. The patient had not travelled outside the country. The virus may have been lurking deep in their lungs where nose and throat swabs could not detect it, Snell said. Dr Gaia Nebbia, a co-author of the study, said new treatment strategies “are urgently needed” to help patients clear persistent infections. “This may also prevent the emergence of variants,” she said. The work is to be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Lisbon on Friday, Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, who was not involved in the study, said there may be some people who never clear their Covid infections. While antiviral drugs and antibody therapies help many patients, the antibody treatments in clinics today are less effective against Omicron than previous variants. “Equally important would be to manage the underlying cause of the immune suppression in the hope that the person’s immune system could recover,” Hunter said.",News/World news,First person to have Covid infection for more than a year identified in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/first-person-to-have-covid-infection-for-more-than-a-year-identified-in-uk
