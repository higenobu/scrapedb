2/24/2022,"Vegetarians have a 14% lower chance of developing cancer than carnivores, according to a large study that links meat-eating to a heightened risk of the disease. A team of researchers from Oxford University analysed data on more than 470,000 Britons and found that pescatarians had a 10% reduced risk. Compared with people who eat meat regularly – defined as more than five times a week – those who consumed small amounts had a 2% lower risk of developing cancer, the study found.  “In this large British cohort, being a low meat-eater, fish-eater or vegetarian was associated with a lower risk of all cancer sites when compared to regular meat-eaters,” the analysis found. However, the authors, led by Cody Watling from Oxford’s population health cancer epidemiology unit, made clear that their findings did not conclusively prove regular meat-eating increased the risk of cancer. Smoking and body fat could also help explain the differences found, they said. Their study of participants in the UK Biobank study also found that: Low meat-eaters – who consume meat five or fewer times a week – had a 9% lower risk of developing bowel cancer than regular meat-eaters. Vegetarian women were 18% less likely than those who ate meat regularly to develop postmenopausal breast cancer, though that may be due to their lower body mass index. Vegetarian men have a 31% lower risk of prostate cancer while among male pescatarians it is 20% lower. “The results … suggest that specific dietary behaviours such as low meat [and] vegetarian or pescatarian diets can have an impact on reducing the risk of certain cancers; in this case bowel, breast and prostate,” said Dr Giota Mitrou, director of research and innovation at World Cancer Research Fund International (WCRF), which co-funded the study with Cancer Research UK. The results confirm WCRF’s longstanding advice that people should limit their intake of red and processed meat and eat more wholegrains, vegetables, fruit and pulses, she added. The Oxford study authors said: “The lower risk of colorectal [bowel] cancer in low meat-eaters is consistent with previous evidence suggesting an adverse impact of meat intake. Vegetarian women’s lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer is likely to be “largely” explained by their lower BMI. “It is not clear whether the other differences observed for all cancers and for prostate cancer reflect any causal relationship or are due to other factors.” While the researchers found that “being a low meat-eater, pescatarian or vegetarian was associated with a lower risk of all cancer”, they added that this “may be a result of dietary factors and/or non-dietary differences in lifestyle, such as smoking”. Their results are published on Thursday in the journal BMC Medicine. Richard McIlwain, chief executive of the Vegetarian Society, said: “This study adds to a growing body of research reinforcing the positive, protective effects of a vegetarian diet. “With cancer now affecting one in every two of us across the country, adopting a healthy vegetarian diet can clearly play a role in preventing this disease. Indeed, evidence from previous surveys suggests a balanced vegetarian diet can also reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes, in addition to cancers.” Watling and his colleagues are undertaking further research among vegetarians, pescatarians and vegans to examine more closely the relationship between diet and cancer risk. Between 5% and 7% of Britons are thought to be vegetarian and 2-3% follow a vegan diet, according to surveys by YouGov. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health and patient information, said that while reducing intake of processed meat has been proven to reduce the risk of bowel cancer “having some bacon or ham every now and then won’t do much harm”, adding: “If you are having a lot of meat a lot of the time then cutting down is a good idea, but a vegetarian diet doesn’t always mean someone is eating healthily.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Vegetarians have 14% lower cancer risk than meat-eaters, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/24/vegetarians-have-14-lower-cancer-risk-than-meat-eaters-study-finds
2/24/2022,"Three months ago Ronson Chan was working as deputy assignment editor at Stand News, one of Hong Kong’s independent and pro-democracy news sites. His job involved assigning news stories to the team of reporters, helping set the editorial agenda and running the outlet’s social media posts. As head of the Hong Kong Journalism Association he had seen up close the fallout from the Beijing media crackdown – closures, arrests, the offshoring of international bureaus.  Then the knock on his door came and his own career was dramatically paused. On the same day, 29 December, his colleagues – including the paper’s editor-in-chief and some board members – were arrested in an early morning national security operation which also saw hundreds of officers raid the newsroom. Today Chan works as a delivery driver and is among scores of reporters and editors in Hong Kong whose lives are in limbo. To make ends meet he spent the lunar new year driving his car around Hong Kong, making deliveries for a friend’s online retail business. According to the International Federation of Journalists, about 20 journalists and press defenders have been arrested or detained by law enforcement so far under Hong Kong’s media crackdown, overseen by Beijing and carried out by a police force empowered with new laws and resources. The popular pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily was forced to close months before Stand News. Independent outlet Citizen News shut its doors just days after. Foreign bureaus have moved staff overseas and correspondents have been denied visas. Alongside Chan, an estimated 1,000 people have lost their jobs, plus several hundred more in Apple Daily’s Taiwan sister-paper. Many Hong Kong journalists couldn’t find their way back to the industry, and now drive taxis or sell food, Vice reported. If Chan doesn’t find a new journalism job soon he’ll be forced to give up his role as the head of the journalism association. “I want to continue on my career path as a journalist, but it really depends on what are the opportunities that lie ahead,” he says. The knock on the door on 29 December wasn’t unexpected, Chan said, but it did come faster than he thought. “I woke up to the doorbell and I doubted whether what was happening was real,” he said. “There was barely a sense of anxiety or fear, but I was shaking beyond control as the officers held a search warrant.” The national security department officers were there to search his apartment and take him in for questioning, part of an investigation into Stand News and alleged conspiring to publish seditious content. At the same time, six others were being arrested across the city, including chief editor Patrick Lam, former chief editor Chung Pui-Kuen and former board member Christine Fang, and former board members Denise Ho, Margaret Ng, and Tat-chi Chow. Later that day, after being questioned without charge, he went straight to the newsroom where a decision had already been made: it was time to close the paper. “The editor-in-chief [Patrick Lam] was not there because he had been arrested,” Chan says. “They decided to cease operation as soon as possible … and I vowed my support of their decision.”“There is not much in detail I can share, I am afraid, but we have expected that this would happen one day, so we put things in the pipeline, [ready] for the worst to come.” The national security officers searched Chan’s home, seized his electronics and took him away for questioning. He livestreamed the raid on Facebook for as long as he could until an officer told him to stop, and the recording now joins a large catalogue of early-morning door knocks filmed by journalists, politicians and activists being arrested in the last two years. In the weeks since the raid, Chan has had to defend the journalist’s union, which he still leads, against government inquiries into its activities and demands for financial records. He continues to speak out about press freedom and in his spare time he visits his friends in prison. “At first, we grieved that we were in that kind of situation. But after a month of living behind bars, they have grown stronger and tougher and more courageous. We have been getting along, just chatting about our daily life and so on.” Stand News was founded in 2014 as an online independent and crowdfunded outlet, mostly covering Hong Kong’s political and social news, and grew to be seen as one of the city’s most credible sources, according to academic surveys. In 2019 its reporters were on the frontline of the pro-democracy protests – including Gwyneth Ho, who kept filming as she was attacked and beaten by assailants at Yuen Long. In recent months it has been targeted by the city’s powerful. Security chief Chris Tang labeled it a biased outlet and accused it of “smearing and demonising” government programmes. This year Stand News was shortlisted for a Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom award. Asked how he sees the outlet’s ethos, Chan pulls out his phone and says he has a Facebook post with an old mission statement he wants to read out. But then he starts scowling at the screen, exasperated as he realises that his Facebook account has been hacked – a frequent occurrence lately. The crackdown on the press has left journalists in fear of being questioned, arrested or charged. The vagueness in the national security law means no one knows where the red lines are, and while the law is not retroactive there is a lack of clarity about how to treat previously published stories which are still online, and how a journalist’s earlier – and at the time lawful – actions can be considered as signalling intent. Chan doesn’t know if he faces arrest in the future. He supports those still working as journalists in Hong Kong but warns they are susceptible to intimidation or punitive actions over their reporting, without clear parameters of what is OK. “There is no one forcing or telling you what to write and what not to write, but there will be consequences if you do something that crosses the line.” Six months before the raid Chan had told an interviewer that nobody could stop him from pursuing any kind of news story, “but you don’t know how long this freedom can be exercised”.

2/24/2022,"The prospect of sanctions is hurting the Russian part-owner of one of Australia’s largest alumina refineries, Queensland Alumina Limited, while the refinery’s majority owner, Rio Tinto, has warned of a looming “disruption” to its aluminium business. QAL, which operates a refinery in Gladstone, is 20% owned by the Russian aluminium giant Rusal, which has previously been hit by US sanctions in 2018, implemented in response to the country’s “malign activity around the globe”.  Rusal’s share price has taken a battering as tensions in Ukraine escalate, falling up to 22% in Hong Kong, the biggest fall since April 2018, according to Bloomberg. QAL would not comment when approached by Guardian Australia about whether it feared further sanctions, or what impact they might have on the company. But Rio, which holds an 80% stake in QAL, told investors on Wednesday night that it was worried about the escalating tensions, which were creating a “very difficult situation”. “Specifically in our business, I think what there could be disruption to primarily the aluminium industry,” said its chief executive, Jakob Stausholm. “If we are going to see sanctions and, you know, we saw sanctions in 2018, I’d like to say, on that front, we managed well last time there were sanctions. And the advantage for Rio Tinto of having such a big aluminium industry is that we have an integrated supply chain from bauxite to alumina to final aluminium products, and that puts us in a very good position to meet our customer needs during times of disruptions.” The previous sanctions against Rusal were removed in January 2019 after the company’s founder, the billionaire Oleg Deripaska, gave up control of the company. So far, Australia’s sanctions have focused on Russia’s banks and eight members of its national security council. The sanctions involve travel bans and financial restrictions. Scott Morrison has also warned that the sanctions announced on Wednesday were only the first tranche and that more would follow if Russia did not de-escalate. Further measures are expected from the US and the EU. “We’ve got plenty left in the tank when it comes to further actions we would take if and when the violence is escalated by Russia,” the prime minister said. The Russian embassy in Australia has described Australia’s sanctions as “xenophobic”, a description dismissed by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, as the remarks of a bully. Morrison said on Thursday he did not expect the sanctions would deter Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Now, I note that many have said, ‘Do you think that this will lead to Russia pulling back?’ I would hope so, but I don’t expect so,” he said. “The reason we’re doing this is there must be a price for the unprovoked, unlawful, unwarranted, unjustified attacks and threats and intimidation that has been imposed by Russia on Ukraine.” Ukraine’s Australian representative, Volodymyr Shalkivskyi, praised the sanctions and said fresh penalties should be directed towards energy and finance, which he said were the most vulnerable sectors in Russia. “We believe there’s need for significant expansion of sanctions but this will depend on the situation on the ground,” Shalkivskyi said.",News/Australia news,Prospect of sanctions hits Russian part-owner of Queensland alumina refinery,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/prospect-of-sanctions-hits-russian-part-owner-of-queensland-alumina-refinery
