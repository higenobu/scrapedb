4/11/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has demanded more from his Mercedes team if he is to keep any hope of competing for this year’s Formula One world championship alive. The seven-time champion was fourth at the Australian Grand Prix and is more than aware of the gulf that remains between Mercedes and front-runners Ferrari and Red Bull. Charles Leclerc’s dominant win at Melbourne emphasised just how strong the Ferrari is this year, with Hamilton and his teammate George Russell, who was third, still almost a second off its pace. Hamilton now trails Leclerc by 43 points after three races, an enormous deficit to make up and one that cannot be addressed unless Mercedes solve their car’s aerodynamic jarring. He insisted he would be making every effort to encourage the team to make a step forward. “There is performance to be gained and we need it now, not in two or three races,” he said. “I have got to keep that encouragement and energy high. I will be on Zoom calls with our bosses, really trying to rally them up. It is about making sure we leave no stone unturned, that the hunger is there and we are maximising every moment. I will be chasing the people in the wind tunnel, the aerodynamic guys, and just looking at every single area.” The British driver also clarified a radio call he made during the race, appearing to show frustration that Russell had been able to pass him by taking a pit stop under the safety car. “You guys put me in a really difficult position,” he had told his team. He maintained later that his remark was not aimed at what was perceived as the driver feeling unfairly treated compared to his teammate, but rather related to an issue with his car. “I couldn’t race for position because the car was overheating so I had to back off,” he said when asked about the comment.",Sport/Sport,‘We need it now’: Lewis Hamilton urges Mercedes to make vast improvement,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/lewis-hamilton-urges-mercedes-to-show-hunger-as-ferrari-surge-ahead
4/11/2022,"Elon Musk has set out his vision for Twitter after buying a 9.2% stake in the company, in a series of posts on the social network described by one commentator as having “chaos energy”. Since being appointed to the Twitter board on Tuesday, Musk has posted a stream of open questions about the present and future of the site, proposing new features, highlighting areas of concern, and making jokes. Typically for the Tesla billionaire, it was not always clear which was which. Musk’s most long-running concern with the direction of Twitter has been its moderation policies. In late March – after he had acquired a large stake in the company, but before he had disclosed that publicly – he tweeted a poll asking users whether Twitter adhered to the principle of free speech. “Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,” he added. “What should be done?” In 2021, Musk had declared: “A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” and just last month declared himself “a free speech absolutist”. Musk has personally started some moderation controversies on Twitter, as in March 2020, when he tweeted that children were “essentially immune” to Covid, leading to calls on the social network to remove his tweet for breaking then-new rules about Covid misinformation. Twitter ultimately declined, arguing that it did not break the rules “when reviewing the overall context and conclusion of the tweet”. Since his appointment to the board, though, Musk has also suggested more prosaic changes to the social network. In one tweet, he proposed adding an edit button to let users rewrite their posts after they had been sent, prompting a resurgence of debate about whether such a feature would help or harm the global conversation. Musk expressed concern that many of the most-followed accounts on Twitter “tweet rarely and post very little content”, asking: “Is Twitter dying? For example, Taylor Swift hasn’t posted anything in 3 months. And Justin Bieber only posted once this entire year.” In another set of tweets, he criticised the service offered by Twitter Blue, the company’s subscription package, arguing that it should come with an “authentication checkmark” and no adverts – since “the power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive”. Other proposals seem less likely to come to pass. Musk asked his followers whether Twitter should convert its headquarters in San Francisco to a homeless shelter “since no one shows up anyway” (91% of his followers have voted yes); he also asked them whether he should “delete the w in twitter?” That question, posted around midnight local time, came with two options: “yes” and “of course”. More than a million people have engaged with the joke, with “yes” leading the vote. Drawing the line between a Twitter joke and a serious proposal can be hard with the former PayPal chief executive, who has previously made and sold flamethrowers, liquidated billions of dollars of Tesla stock, and launched a car into space, all after suggesting that he would do so on social media.",News/Technology,Elon Musk unveils vision for Twitter after joining board,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/10/elon-musk-unveils-vision-for-twitter-after-joining-its-board
4/11/2022,"As a retired primary school teacher, I will not be alone in owing David McKee a huge debt for inspiring many philosophy lessons and school assemblies. While acting out Two Monsters was always a graphic way of illustrating the dangers of retaliation and mutually assured destruction (a pertinent lesson at the moment), and the Elmer books never failed to delight (while providing stimulation for many cross-curricular activities), my personal favourite was Tusk Tusk. This book is, in many ways, the perfect illustration of the dangers of prejudice, discrimination and violence - yet one that manages to convey a hopeful outcome.",Arts/Books,Letter: David McKee obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/10/letter-david-mckee-obituary
4/11/2022,"The Christian Eriksen-inspired state of grace continues to guide Brentford to safe, Premier League shores of contentment. A maiden season in the top tier was almost guaranteed in the seismic, generation-spanning, memorable 4-1 win at Chelsea last weekend. And another London derby triumph, here at the Community Stadium against West Ham, a team tilting at the Europa League, was fully deserved. Thomas Frank’s side were brighter and sassier going forward, with Eriksen and Rico Henry the pick of Brentford’s bunch. Second-half goals from strike partners Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney, the currency. Tired West Ham’s top-four hopes are appearing increasingly remote – and on this evidence, hustled and harried throughout, the impression was that their Europa League adventures are a main concern. David Moyes also has to contend with an injury to Kurt Zouma, ahead of their quarter-final second leg at Lyon on Thursday. Frank made two changes to the vibrant team which stormed Stamford Bridge. It was, in reality, probably asking too much for them to emulate similar drama, but they largely coasted here. Centre-back Zanka was a late addition, coming in for Pontus Jansson, absent from from the match-day squad due to illness, while impact winger, Yoane Wissa, who scored Brentford’s fourth goal at Chelsea, replaced Mads Roerslev. Christian Nørgaard took over the hosts’ captaincy for the day from Jansson. Manuel Lanzini was in the West Ham side, meanwhile, after recovering from the effects of a car crash. He was one of three changes to the team that earned a 1-1 draw at home to Lyon on Thursday in the Europa League quarter-final first leg, chosen ahead of former Brentford striker Saïd Benrahma, who dropped to the bench. Alphonse Areola, West Ham’s preferred Euro goalkeeper, made way for Lukasz Fabianski, while Vladimir Coufal came in for Ryan Fredericks at full-back. Eriksen was orchestrating Brentford’s initial probing as they aimed to add West Ham to both Chelsea and Arsenal on their London hit list. Yet, other than a tame Mbeumo header easily saved by Fabianski, the nervy, early skirmishes produced little drama, with the onus on Brentford to get top scorer Toney into the game. On several occasions Eriksen, with his precise passing, was to discover some of his ponderous teammates were not quite on his wavelength. The rewards did come, though. Unsurprisingly, with the trip to France in mind, West Ham were reluctant to press forward at will. The visitors were particularly cautious and clearly feeling after effects of those home exertions against Lyon: a weak Tomas Soucek header, with the midfielder unmarked and in a good position, reflected as much. Even Jarrod Bowen, the club’s man of the season, appeared a marginal figure for the most part. This was not to be Zouma’s afternoon either, the injured defender hobbling off for Issa Diop as Moyes was forced to ring an early change. Doubts now exist over Zouma’s availability for the crucial trip to the Grand Stade de Lyon. Brentford nearly broke through a minute from the interval, with West Ham defender Coufal very fortunate to see his header spin over when meeting a viciously spinning Eriksen set piece. At the other end, a wild lash wide from an inviting close-range position by Aaron Cresswell summed up an unremarkable West Ham. Mercifully for the home support, Mbeumo punctured events with a timely opener two minutes into the second half. The forward skipped past Cresswell, fastening on to a neat assist from Toney, via a move begun by a Kristoffer Ajer throw-in, to drive a left-foot shot under Fabianski. The breakthrough provided welcome, deserved relief for Brentford as West Ham were subsequently challenged to act with greater spark. Benrahma, meanwhile, appeared as a 56th-minute substitution for Lanzini to a warm reception from the Brentford faithful, many of whom occasionally pine for their former forward. Nevertheless, it was Toney, a contemporary hero for Brentford, who doubled the lead on 64 minutes from an expertly created move. The hugely impressive Henry sent in a deep cross from the left, which was nodded back invitingly by Mbeumo, before Toney headed the ball contemptuously past an exposed Fabianski. From then on, Frank’s side dominated and West Ham’s fatigue showed. That the visitors were on damage limitation mode with at least 20 minutes to go – other than a speculative, deflected shot over by Benrahma – must concern Moyes. The east Londoners need to absorb this disappointment quickly, while their Europa League quest remains alive.",Sport/Football,Christian Eriksen pulls the strings as Brentford see off weary West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/10/brentford-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
