12/22/2021,"By Mark Trevelyan (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's but could put up a level of resistance that would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to pay a price of many thousands of Russian lives for any new invasion. Western military analysts say Ukraine's army is better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimean peninsula without a fight, and highly motivated to defend the country's heartland. For those reasons, they see it as highly unlikely that Putin would contemplate an outright conquest of Ukraine. ""We won't see a big giant red arrow going across Ukraine. I don't believe the Russians have the capability to just completely overrun Ukraine and take over the whole country, nor do I think they want to,"" said Ben Hodges, a retired U.S. lieutenant general now with the Center for European Policy Analysis. A plausible alternative, he and others said, was that Russia might push south and west from Ukraine's Donbass region - already controlled by pro-Russian forces - to link up with annexed Crimea and the Black Sea. But even that more limited objective would entail high Russian casualties. Siemon Wezeman, an arms specialist at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the scale of resistance to any invasion would dwarf anything Russia had faced in previous military operations in Chechnya in the 1990s or in its short war with Georgia in 2008. ""Yes it can defeat, say, the high level of Ukrainian forces, but try to invade a country like Ukraine with a population that is clearly against you, which is armed to the teeth, where most males have at least rudimentary military training that they can still remember. You're going into an area which is Chechnya multiplied by 10, or Georgia multiplied by 30,"" he said. ""It's not going to be a walkover. And then you have to defend to your own population as Russian president that you just suffered 10,000 losses in the first few days because you were stupid enough to support the Donbass rebels. I don't think that's going to resonate very well in Russia."" Ukraine says 92,000 Russian troops have gathered near its borders, and the United States has said a Russian invasion by a force as large as 175,000 could come as early as January. Moscow denies menacing its neighbour and say it can move its troops around as it sees fit on its own territory. It says it perceives a threat from Ukraine's growing ties with NATO - which Kyiv seeks one day to join - and is demanding security guarantees from the West to defuse the crisis. DAUNTING NUMBERS In terms of manpower and weapons, the arithmetic looks grim for Ukraine. Russia's army of 280,000 is about twice the size of Ukraine's and its total armed forces of 900,000 are more than four times greater. Its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). While Ukraine trebled its defence budget in real terms from 2010 to 2020, its total defence expenditure last year amounted to only $4.3 billion, or one-tenth of Russia's. ""In terms of air defence and electronic warfare, there is a huge gap between these two forces. It's difficult to see how Ukraine could not be completely overwhelmed from the air,"" said IISS research analyst Yohann Michel. Russia would seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary's command and control and cut off communications with units in the field, he said. But Ukraine's combat experience in Donbass and its short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry - which includes U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles - would help to slow any Russian advance. ""It will not be a piece of cake because there is still a large number of (Ukrainian) troops. The majority of them are well motivated, so they will probably fight until the last moment,"" Michel said. Even a defeated Ukraine could ""open their arms depot"", distribute weapons to the population and leave the Russians facing a kind of guerrilla warfare that would make it painful to hold onto any captured territory. ""I would not want to be in six months in any area the Russians would have seized,"" he said. Putin would likely face qualms from his own public about waging war on a fellow Slav nation, as well as intense anti-Russian sentiment within Ukraine. Former U.S. lieutenant general Hodges said that while the numbers were stacked against Ukraine, ""as you know from history, warfare is never just about math"". ""The Ukrainian population will be very hostile, the further west that Russian forces might go. This will be very, very costly for Russian forces,"" he said. ""The reward, the payoff, would have to be really worthwhile to keep (Putin's) own domestic population in support.""

12/22/2021,"Two people are in custody after a brawl broke out at Miami International Airport Monday night in an incident that was caught on video. According to the Miami-Dade Police Department, officers were called out to gate H8 at around 6:35 p.m. after an airport employee reported a disturbance stemming from a delayed charter flight. Responding officers then found an unruly passenger had allegedly taken the keys to an airport transport golf cart, refusing to let the employee leave, CBS Miami reported. Video taken by traveler Mike Majlak captured a large crowd surrounding one of the officers, who had someone in a hold. The officer, who was being grabbed and jostled by the crowd, retreated after breaking his hold. He could then be seen holding what appears to be a weapon while radioing for help with his offhand. Miami police reported the officer was not injured. Backup officers eventually responded to the scene and were able to control the crowd. Two individuals were taken into custody and charges are pending. Miami International Airport Director and CEO Ralph Cutié released the following statement to CBS News: ""Like airports across the country, MIA is seeing record-high passenger numbers this winter travel season. Unfortunately, that passenger growth has come with a record-high increase nationwide in bad behavior as well, such as the incident this evening at MIA. Disruptive passengers face police arrest, civil penalties up to $37,000, being banned from flying, and potential federal prosecution. We have worked so hard to rebound from the pandemic and make traveling safe again, so we can visit our loved ones. Please travel responsibly by getting to the airport extra early, being patient, complying with the federal mask law and airport staff, limiting your alcohol consumption, and notifying police at the first sign of bad behavior by calling 911.""

12/22/2021,"Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, on Tuesday called on Fox News to fire host Jesse Watters for targeting him with violent rhetoric at a conservative conference earlier this week. “That’s awful that he said that. And he’s going to go, very likely, unaccountable,” Fauci told CNN of Watters’ remarks. “I mean, whatever network he’s on is not going to do anything for him. I mean, that’s crazy. The guy should be fired on the spot.” Speaking on Monday at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest conference, Watters encouraged attendees to rhetorically “ambush” Fauci with dubious questions about the National Institutes of Health allegedly funding “gain-of-function” research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “Now you go in for the kill shot. The kill shot? With an ambush? Deadly. Because he doesn’t see it coming,” Watters said. Fauci — who is President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser and has served for 37 years as director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — on Tuesday described Watters’ remarks as “horrible.” “The only thing that I have ever done throughout these two years is to encourage people to practice good public health practices: to get vaccinated, to be careful in public settings, to wear a mask,” Fauci said. “And for that, you have some guy out there saying that people should be giving me a kill shot to ambush me? I mean, what kind of craziness is there in society these days?” Fox News declined to comment on the record on whether it endorses Watters’ remarks or plans to take disciplinary action against him. Fox News also did not respond to a request for comment on Fauci’s critique of the network. Fox News hosts, as well as Republican congressional lawmakers, have repeatedly targeted Fauci throughout the coronavirus pandemic with inflammatory and personal attacks. Lara Logan, a Fox News personality and host on its streaming service, compared him to the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele earlier this month. In response to those remarks, Fauci rebuked Fox News for not taking disciplinary action against Logan, telling MSNBC: “What I find striking … is how she gets no discipline whatsoever from the Fox network — how they can let her say that with no comment and no disciplinary action. I’m astounded by that.”",Politics/Politico,‘The guy should be fired on the spot’: Fauci rebukes Fox News host over violent rhetoric,https://news.yahoo.com/guy-fired-spot-fauci-rebukes-143213409.html
12/22/2021,"A Black San Francisco UPS delivery driver claims she was subjected to racial profiling after being given a citation that she says was for double-parking her service truck earlier this month in a confrontation that was caught on her cellphone and has since gone viral. The incident took place on Tuesday, Dec. 7, around 11:30 a.m. on Haight Street near Masonic, when Nakisha Ferguson doubled-parked her delivery truck to drop off several packages, KRON reported. In the 3-minute clip, that has racked over 2 million views on TikTok, Ferguson is approached by a police officer, during which she explains to the camera that she’s “being pulled over by SFPD while I deliver my packages. I am a delivery driver in full brown delivering packages, and I get pulled over for double parking for 2 seconds while I deliver my f-cking packages.” Ferguson said she was being pulled over “everywhere on this street” because “there is nowhere for me to park. I go up and down the Haight.” According to the station, parking is extremely difficult in that particular part of town. Ferguson was even shocked to have gotten a citation, thinking double-parking was normal behavior. “I never knew that they pulled over people. I see UPS drivers, FedEx drivers, Amazon drivers, everybody double parking to deliver,” Ferguson added. The woman was then approached by two more officers, whom she refused to speak to. She was then told to “not admit guilt” but sign a citation. “I’m not signing nothing,” she said. “I am at work delivering my packages.” “I wanna see you pull over somebody else, another driver,” she said to the officers. “Since it’s a black girl, I get a ticket.” The confrontation appeared to draw attention from local bystanders. The woman told reporters she believed she was stopped because she was Black. “I feel like if I wasn’t this young black girl, I wouldn’t have got a ticket. I probably would have got a warning. A siren to move your vehicle,” she explained. Haight District San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston’s office told the station that they were “extremely concerned about the incident in which SFPD ticketed a Black ups driver in the Haight for double parking while making a delivery. We have reached out to SFPD and are eager to get to the bottom of this.” Meanwhile, the San Francisco Police Department released a statement to the outlet revealing that “This incident is now under investigation by the SF Department of Public Accountability. Because this is an open investigation, we cannot comment further.” A new city ordinance protecting delivery drivers from being cited while double-parked in the city reportedly may be in order soon.
