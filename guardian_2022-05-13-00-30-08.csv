5/13/2022,"Seth Meyers roasted Republicans for distracting the public from the end of Roe v Wade, starting with Maine senator Susan Collins. The Republican senator, who claims to be pro-choice but voted to confirm conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, called the police in Maine this week on a protester who chalked a message – “Susie, please, Mainers want WHPA – vote yes, clean up your mess” – outside her house. (WHPA refers to the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion rights.) “That’s right, Susan Collins called the cops because someone wrote with chalk on the sidewalk outside her house,” the Late Night host said Wednesday evening. “Did she freak out when there’s a yard sale in her neighborhood? And the note wasn’t even threatening! It said please.” “Of course, Susan Collins claims she’s pro-choice,” Meyers continued, “but in reality she and her fellow Republicans would much rather spend their time freaking out about polite chalk messages or the identity of the person who leaked the supreme court opinion than the actual substance of what’s happening: that the supreme court is on the verge of erasing a woman’s right to bodily autonomy, and that states are already pushing forward with severe new restrictions on reproductive rights.” Though it’s possible the draft opinion was leaked by a conservative employee of the court, Republicans such as Ted Cruz have maintained, without evidence, that it had to be a “left-wing law clerk” who was at fault. Asked why, Cruz told a reporter: “because I’m not a moron. Because I live on planet Earth.” “Eh, you might live here, but clearly you’re not from here,” said Meyers. “I refuse to believe that voice is actually human. You sound like you swallowed a kazoo, and that beard definitely looks like a disguise you’d see in Men in Black.” “We don’t know who the leaker is – (cough) Ginni Thomas (cough),” Meyers added, “but Republicans would much rather focus on the leak than the substance of the bill they blocked today. Because preserving Roe v Wade is massively popular.” Despite overlapping crises – the threat against bodily autonomy, the rising cost of living, impending climate disaster – “Republicans would rather whine and throw tantrums about leaks and sidewalk chalk,” he concluded. “These people talk about leaks so much, you’d think their pants were,” to quote Trump talking about his belief in hurricane guns, “tremendously wet.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mourned a “stupefying day in the history of this country” as the Senate failed to pass the WHPA, which would have codified abortion rights nationwide. Every Democrat voted for the measure, which needed 60 votes to pass, except Joe Manchin, “who voted with his fellow Republicans,” Kimmel quipped. “The Democrats wanted to get their counterparts on the record opposing it. Chuck Schumer said he called for the vote so we would know where Republicans stand,” Kimmel said. “Turns out they’re standing in the year 1865. Almost feels like maybe we shouldn’t have let the host of Celebrity Apprentice pick three supreme court justices, you know?” Kimmel also discussed “some five-star nonsense” on the Senate floor. Steve Daines, Republican senator from Montana, presented an argument that “he seems to have gotten from an old Saturday cartoon,” Kimmel said. Next to a poster featuring pictures of sea turtles and human babies, Daines argued for banning abortion because it’s illegal to tamper with the eggs of federally protected species such as sea turtles. “OK, now I have some visual aids to explain just how dumb that was,” Kimmel said, whipping out a sea turtle puppet. “Hello, I’m a sea turtle. I can’t believe I need to say this, but we aren’t human beings.” “Now, I know some of you might look like us,” he added next to a photo of Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, “but sea turtles, we are an endangered species. Humans are not. And if a mama sea turtle doesn’t want to have a baby, there’s no old white guy from Montana telling her she has to. She just lays her eggs in the sand and crawls away. And unlike people, mama sea turtles don’t have to work to support their kids or feed them or drive them to school.” “It’s very simple, right?” Kimmel concluded.",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on Roe: ‘Republicans would much rather focus on the leak than the substance’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/12/seth-meyers-roe-republicans-susan-collins
5/13/2022,"Sri Lanka’s beleaguered president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has sworn in a new prime minister to replace his brother as the country reels from days of violence. The new PM, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has held the post five times before, will head up a “unity government” tasked with finding a way out of Sri Lanka’s worst economic crisis since independence, with severe shortages of food, fuel and medicines and long power cuts. The 73-year-old, a stalwart of Sri Lankan politics for more than four decades, last served as prime minister between 2015 and 2019 after an election that unseated the powerful Rajapaksa clan from power after more than a decade. “We are facing a crisis, we have to get out of it,” Wickremesinghe told Reuters as he left a temple in the main city of Colombo shortly after his swearing in. Asked whether there was a possible solution, he replied: “Absolutely.” Wickremesinghe heads the United National party (UNP), which has only one seat in parliament, but Vajira Abeywardena, a UNP official, said a Wickremesinghe-led government had the majority support of 160 out of 225 MPs. “He is being sworn in as prime minister … because a number of members of parliament have asked him to take over and solve the country’s problems,” Abeywardena said. Mahinda Rajakapsa, the president’s brother, reluctantly resigned as prime minister on Monday after violent attacks by the family’s supporters on peaceful anti-government protesters. Protesters have blamed the president for devastating economic mismanagement and corruption that have pushed Sri Lanka to the brink of bankruptcy, and repeatedly called on him to quit. It is unclear whether Wickremesinghe’s appointment will be enough to placate them. Monday’s attacks by pro-government supporters of the Rajapaksas on a peaceful protest camp in Colombo led to several days of violence in which at least nine people were killed and more than 200 injured. Dozens of residences owned by the Rajapaksas and their loyalists were set on fire. The army was deployed across Colombo, police were given orders to shoot looters on sight, and a nationwide curfew was in place until Thursday morning. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s resignation meant the government and cabinet was dissolved, leaving a power vacuum. The main opposition SJB party was initially invited to lead a new government, but its leader, Sajith Premadasa, insisted the president step down first. Rumours of Wickremesinghe’s appointment began circulating on Wednesday night after he was seen leaving a meeting with Gotabaya Rajapaksa. In a television address on Wednesday night, the president had promised he would “name a prime minister who will command a majority in parliament and the confidence of the people”. He also made it clear, however, that he would not bow to the protesters’ demands and resign. Wickremesinghe is a political opponent of the Rajapaksas, but he is known to have a close relationship with the powerful political clan. As the economic crisis began to engulf the country, he had several closed-door meetings with the president and the prime minister and was consulted on government discussions with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Sri Lanka is in negotiations over an emergency bailout. Wickremsinghe has been very critical of decisions the Rajapaksa regime has taken, however, particularly its refusal to go to the IMF. He was among those who called for the prime minister to step down after Monday’s violence. Some see Wickremesinghe as a safe pair of hands to run an interim government, but others questioned his appointment given that his party has only one seat in parliament. In an interview with the Guardian in April, Wickremesinghe denied he had any intention of joining the government, despite reports he was working with the Rajapaksas behind the scenes. “No, no, I’m only getting involved in the sense of helping to resolve some of the economic issues from the outside, I’m not joining the government as a minister or anything,” he said. “That leaves me free. I have no interest except to make sure people are fed and parliament takes control of the situation.” Amid fears that members of the ruling elite might try to flee the country, the courts imposed an overseas travel ban on Thursday on 17 leaders of the governing Sri Lanka People’s Front (SLPP), including Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son Namal.",News/World news,Sri Lanka president brings back five-time former PM in effort to ease crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/ranil-wickremesinghe-former-sri-lanka-pm-lead-unity-government-after-violence
5/13/2022,"Rafael Behr is spot-on (Inane and Orwellian: a Queen’s speech to improve the life of Boris Johnson, 10 May). The Queen’s speech was flimsy because it failed to offer any plan to assist the millions of ordinary people who will struggle to survive the impact of economic stresses ahead. And it was sinister, because underpinning this agenda is the iron fist of the state enforcing the erosion of our civil and human rights in actions reminiscent of totalitarian states. Judging by Prince Charles’s intonation and demeanour, I guess he might well agree too. In the face of shrivelling incomes, escalating prices and a recession on the horizon, this government is not only devoid of ideas, but appears totally immune to the pain and distress already experienced by hard-working families without financial reserves, to those pensioners like Elsie (Woman who rides bus to stay warm is tip of pensioner poverty iceberg, 3 May) who have to choose between eating and heating, and all those whose income fails to provide even basic sustenance. Now is the time for the Labour party to be courageous and challenge the electorate to endorse traditional Labour policies of redistributing wealth, taxing excessive profits, tackling poverty, and the realigning of a properly funded national health service.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  Rafael Behr nails essential Conservatism perfectly when he writes of Boris Johnson that “the most powerful faction among his MPs will not, as a point of ideological principle, countenance anything that seriously interferes with the accrual of wealth and privilege to those who already have them”.

5/13/2022,"Pots and pans, piles of shirts and shoes, jewellery-laden tables, and boxes brimming with bric-a-brac. In the tangle of streets near exit 3 of Seoul’s Dongmyo station, hundreds of vendors sell everything from old Instamatic cameras to books, bags and vinyl records. Located in the South Korean capital’s historic district of Dongdaemun, Dongmyo’s bustling flea market is scattered around a shrine built in honour of an ancient Chinese military commander. But there is more to the neighbourhood than bargains, vintage clothes, and retro treasures. It also serves as a cultural hub for the city’s senior citizens to shop, socialise and show off their unique style. “One day, I noticed a senior gentleman looking for clothes just like me. His style blew me away,” recalls Seoul-based photographer Kim Dong-hyun, 29, who spends his days documenting the city’s vibrant senior street fashion scene, much of which he shares on Instagram. Over the years, Dongmyo has undergone a lot of change, becoming a destination for young people’s newfound appreciation of vintage clothing on a budget. At its core though, Dongmyo has always been a playground for the city’s elderly population. “I’ve met some people who have been going there every week for 30 years,” Kim says, based on the many conversations he has had with the people he has photographed. South Korea is a rapidly ageing society. By 2050, the number of elderly people could account for nearly 44% of the country’s population. While many senior citizens feel healthier than ever and do not regard themselves as old, elderly loneliness is a significant problem. “In Korea, there aren’t many places where elderly people can go and have fun. But in Dongmyo, they can go shopping, they can play, meet friends and drink makgeolli [rice wine]. It’s their area, and they don’t need to care about what other people think.” “From their hairdos to their glasses and shoes, they know how to look good and take care of themselves. They pursue their own styles and unique ways to express their individuality. Many of us believe that trendy people are just young people, a message further amplified by the media. But fashion has no age,” he says. Among the senior citizens that hang out in Dongdaemun is Lee Seok-ki, one member of a group known as the “military crew”. The group is comprised of three men whose styles are different from each other: Lee prefers a minimalist traditional military look, while his friends like to reinterpret military style in a modern way, decorating clothes with colourful embroidered patches and badges. If anything, senior fashion is more refined, Kim says. “It’s like wine. In your 20s, you just taste everything, but by your 70s, your taste is sharper – you know what you like.” As a child, Chae Myung-hee, 74, developed a passion for fashion that led her to work as a women’s clothes designer for 40 years. Even during the pandemic when some people dressed down and avoided makeup, she says she made an effort to always look great, whether she was wearing a mask or not. “It’s always been a part of me,” Chae says. In his upcoming book, Mut – Street Fashion of Seoul, Kim provides a glimpse into the world of senior fashion. He hopes the book will provide a new perspective on a demographic that is often overlooked or under-appreciated. Kim says older people should be recognised for their cool and flair, which is known as meot in Korean, or as Kim likes to stylise it online and in his book – mut. “It’s more than the English word ‘cool’,” he says. “Sometimes it can mean something is wonderful, sometimes it can mean nice, sometimes it’s gorgeous or fabulous. I can’t express it differently or translate the word, and don’t see the need for it.” The images offer hope, he says, and a new way of looking at ageing. “I think some people have hope when they see my pictures. They can see that they too can continue to be fashionable when they grow older. “When a headline uses the word ‘grandfather’, we automatically assume something negative … I want to show that seniors have individual personalities, that they too can have their own meot.”",News/World news,‘Fashion has no age’: the stylish senior citizens of Seoul,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/kim-dong-hyun-seoul-stylish-senior-citizens
5/13/2022,"The prospect of growing crops on the moon has edged a little closer after researchers nurtured plants – some more successfully than others – in lunar soil for the first time. Scientists planted thale cress seeds in moon dust brought back by three Apollo missions and watched them sprout and grow into fully fledged plants, raising the potential for astronauts to farm off-world crops. But while the plants survived in the lunar soil, or regolith, they fell short of thriving, growing more slowly than cress planted in volcanic ash, developing stunted roots, and showing clear signs of physiological stress. “We found that plants do indeed grow in lunar regolith, however they respond as if they are growing in a stressful situation,” said Dr Anna-Lisa Paul, a molecular biologist at the University of Florida. Thale cress, or Arabidopsis thaliana, is a small flowering plant related to broccoli, cauliflower and kale. “It’s not especially tasty,” Paul added. The experiments are the first to investigate whether plants can grow in lunar soil and follow an 11-year effort to obtain the rare material. Because the soil is so precious, Nasa loaned only 12g of it – a few teaspoons – to the researchers who conducted the tests. Scientists have long wondered whether the moon could support crops, but with space agencies now planning to return humans to the surface, and potentially build lunar settlements for visitors, the question has become more pressing. “The ability to take plants successfully with us to the moon is how we’ll grow our own food, how we’ll stay there for a while without resupply,” said Dr Robert Ferl, a co-author on the study. “Showing that plants will grow in lunar soil is actually a huge step in that direction, of being able to establish ourselves and lunar colonies.” Writing in Communications Biology, the researchers describe how they planted thale cress seeds in thimble-sized wells containing lunar soil brought back by the Apollo 11, 12 and 17 missions. Further cress seeds were planted in volcanic ash and mineral mixtures that mimic soils on the moon and Mars. When the scientists checked on the seeds a few days later, they were surprised to see nearly all had germinated. “There was this little tiny sea of greenness on lunar greyness that was just astounding,” said Ferl. But some plants grew better than others. Overall, those in lunar soil fared worse than those in volcanic ash. This was not unexpected: lunar soil is poor in nutrients and rich in iron particles, and while the soil is powdery, it is littered with glass fragments from meteorites which are sharp and abrasive, making it difficult to grow in. Molecular analysis confirmed the plants had ramped up genes to deal with environmental stress. Some developed reddish black spots in response. One of the poorest soils for growing the plants was brought back by Apollo 11. This was more exposed to the moon’s surface than the samples returned by Apollo 12 and 17, which were collected from different soil layers. The scientists suspect cosmic rays and radiation from the solar wind damages the top layers of lunar soil, making it harder for plants to thrive in. Armed with the findings, future lunar farmers could seek out younger parts of the moon’s surface where the soils are less battered by the hostile environment. “There are areas on the lunar surface, very extensive lava flows, that are billions of years younger than the sites of the Apollo 11, 12 and 17 landings,” said Dr Stephen Elardo, a geologist on the team. “Going to a younger site on the moon might present a more hospitable substrate, without the need to drill or mine material from deep down.”",News/Science,Cress seeds grown in moon dust raise hopes for lunar crops,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/12/cress-seeds-grown-in-moon-dust-raise-hopes-for-lunar-crops
5/13/2022,"Maine last month became the first state to ban the practice of spreading PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge as fertilizer. But it’s largely on its own in the US, despite a recent report estimating about 20m acres of cropland across the country may be contaminated. Most states are only beginning to look at the problem and some are increasing the amount of sludge they spread on farm fields despite the substance being universally contaminated with PFAS and destroying livelihoods in Maine. “Maine is at the forefront of this because we’ve seen first-hand the damage that sludge causes to farms,” said Patrick MacRoy, deputy director of the non-profit Defend Our Health Maine. The new law also prohibits sludge from being composted with other organic material. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of chemicals used across dozens of industries to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. Though the compounds are highly effective, they are also linked to cancer, kidney disease, birth defects, decreased immunity, liver problems and a range of other serious diseases. Sewage sludge is a semi-solid mix of human excrement and industrial waste that water treatment plants pull from the nation’s sewer system. It’s expensive to dispose of, and about 60% of it is now lightly treated and sold or given away as “biosolid” fertilizer because it is high in plant nutrients. Maine and Michigan are the only two states that are routinely checking sludge and farms for PFAS, and both are finding contamination on farms to be widespread. Maine’s legislature banned the practice of spreading sludge as fertilizer in April after environmental officials discovered astronomical levels of PFAS in water, crops, cattle and soil on farms where sludge had been spread, and high PFAS levels have been detected in farmers’ blood. Contamination from PFAS-tainted sludge has already poisoned well water on around a dozen farms, and has forced several Maine farms to shutter. The state is investigating about 700 more fields where PFAS-contaminated sludge was spread in recent years. Farmers have told the Guardian that many of their peers with contaminated land won’t alert the state because they fear financial ruin. Maine also approved the creation of a $60m fund that will be used to help farmers cover medical monitoring, for buyouts and for other forms of financial assistance. “Folks have been left out to dry without any real help so we’re grateful to see that,” MacRoy said. The sludge legislation comes after Maine last year enacted the nation’s first ban on non-essential uses of PFAS in products. It goes into effect in 2030. In Michigan, environmental officials have downplayed the detection of PFAS in sludge and on farms, and although the state prohibits highly contaminated sludge from being spread, it allows higher levels of the chemicals in sludge than Maine. State regulators have also identified PFAS polluters and required them to stop discharging the chemicals into the sewers. Questions remain about whether that’s enough to keep PFAS out of Michigan’s food supply. Instead of implementing a wide-scale program to test livestock, crops and dairy, the state identified 13 farms it considered most at risk and has claimed contamination on other farms isn’t a risk. Michigan is ahead of most other states. In Virginia, environmental regulators are considering permitting an additional 6,000 acres worth of sludge to be spread and have so far resisted public health advocates’ calls to test for PFAS and reject new sludge permits. In Alabama, the state’s department of environmental management said in 2019 that “the best use of biosolids is as a [fertilizer].” Even as the crisis unfolds in Maine, officials in Alabama are increasing the amount of out-of-state sludge that’s imported and spread on fields or landfilled, and the state in 2020 updated its biosolids rule to “encourage” the use of biosolids as fertilizer. Alabama does not test sludge for PFAS.",News/Environment,Maine bans use of sewage sludge on farms to reduce risk of PFAS poisoning,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/maine-bans-sewage-sludge-fertilizer-farms-pfas-poisoning
5/13/2022,"English cricket has had a bit of a crush on New Zealand in recent times. From the buccaneering if ultimately thwarted World Cup campaign in 2015 that inspired Eoin Morgan’s white-ball side to silverware four years later, to last summer’s World Test Championship triumph, admiration has been plentiful. In some ways, the move to hire one of its architects, Brendon McCullum, should not be a total shock. Nevertheless, McCullum taking charge of the Test team, with the white-ball vacancy still outstanding, is an eye-catching move by Rob Key. It’s in keeping with the wind that has swept through since the lamentable winter too. Key is a director of men’s cricket plucked from the commentary box, Ben Stokes is the new Test captain despite having only occupied the role in one previous first-class match – a head coach who has never done the job with a red-ball team simply completes the set. McCullum, 40 years young, hung up his rapier-like bat only in late 2019 and has since combined a couple of plum Twenty20 coaching roles with punditry. Even with a Caribbean Premier League trophy and a runners-up finish in the Indian Premier League to show for it, his rise to international coach has been rapid and those leapfrogged will doubtless be chuntering. As one veteran county player joked on text this week: “I’m not sure why I’m doing all these ECB coaching courses.” But like Key and Stokes, this appointment is based on a belief that real-life cricketing experience – in this case 101 Test caps and 31 as a dynamic captain – trumps all. Gary Kirsten, once again pipped to the job, took India and South Africa to new heights by galvanising teams with established stars; McCullum, along with Mike Hesson, his head coach, reimagined the culture of the New Zealand setup between 2013 and 2016, something that continued long after they departed. Having drunk in New Zealand’s approach to white-ball cricket, England now want to try the red. Looking at how McCullum did this gives clues to the approach Key wants. And like England’s revival under Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower back in the day, after the brief and loveless Kevin Pietersen/Peter Moores marriage, his tenure began amid acrimony. Ross Taylor had been sacked as captain to much public outcry and shouldered arms the next tour to South Africa. New Zealand then hit rock bottom in McCullum’s first Test in charge, rolled for 45 on the opening morning in Cape Town. Along with Hesson and Mike Sandle, the team manager, McCullum began diagnosing the problems. Players, they felt, were operating as individuals with the goal of doing just enough to stay in the side and not necessarily supporting newcomers. They had also become a touch arrogant on the field and were sledging opponents in a way that was out of character and inauthentic. “The way we played,” McCullum said two years on. “There was no soul.” For McCullum and his support staff this could only be achieved with an honest, optimistic environment and by reminding players why they took up the sport in the first place. “For a long time I had lost that and the team had lost that,” he recalled. “It sounds corny, but we talk about the little boy who fell in love with the game: when you have that mindset you can be positive and aggressive, because you’re thinking about what can go right, rather than what might go wrong.” Have England been guilty of falling out of love with the sport in recent times? Losing never helps and though a charge of arrogance would be a stretch, from the outside it is clear that cabin fever set in during the pandemic. The call from Stokes for a selfless, team-first mentality upon being made Test captain not only chimes with McCullum’s outlook but suggests this had not been the case while Australia were putting them through the Ashes mangle. Mark Wood, one of the most honest members of the squad, recently laid bare some of the whinging that had set in too. “We have to stop making excuses,” Wood told the latest Middle Please, Umpire podcast. “It has been hard with Covid but if we keep making excuses it gives us a way out, or a comfort zone as to why we’re not performing. We need to stand up more as individuals and say, ‘Look, this is why we’re not doing well, how are we going to get better?’ instead of ‘the nets aren’t good, we’ve had Covid, there’s too much travel’. Whatever the excuse, that breeds negativity.” Similarly, Key’s early appraisal was of a negative mentality and so with Covid-safe bubbles (hopefully) in the rear-view mirror, it is clear he believes McCullum’s infectious character, allied with the totemic presence of Stokes, can provide a jolt and maybe some soul. That said, it is important to remember that McCullum was one cog in the New Zealand machine, in conjunction with a wider move to produce better domestic pitches, improved leadership at all levels (ahem, English cricket still has no chair) and consistency in selection and communication. You can predict now that his mantra of “aggressive cricket” will be misunderstood in some quarters when England get it wrong. Like Trevor Bayliss, the previous head coach drafted in from overseas, McCullum preaches the positive option. But while he holds the record for the fastest Test century – 54 balls against Australia in 2016 – his career-best 302 against India in Wellington two years earlier was carved out over nearly 13 hours. Aggression comes in many forms. McCullum will also have to establish the distance required to make dispassionate calls. England’s players love his company after-hours and on the golf course – Morgan, a key influence in his appointment, made him master of ceremonies at his wedding – but the new relationship will require boundaries. Cosiness is not inevitable though. Both McCullum and Stokes are uncompromising men with a strong rugby influence – the former once nudged out Dan Carter at schools level, the latter is the son of a league international – and neither shirks confrontation. All told, it is a daring but calculated appointment starting rather poetically with the visit of New Zealand at Lord’s from 2 June. Nothing is guaranteed with a team that has languished for so long but English cricket, having stared admiringly at McCullum for so long, is about to find out if this can blossom into romance.",Sport/Sport,Dynamism and soul: what Brendon McCullum will bring to England role | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/12/dynamism-and-soul-what-brendon-mccullum-will-bring-to-england-role
5/13/2022,"A major US manufacturer of baby food has said that it could take six to eight weeks for its products to reach shelves following a widespread recall, exacerbating a shortage of baby formula. Abbott Laboratories, which makes baby food and formula, shut its manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan, in February following a federal investigation after it recalled three baby-formula products amid reports of infant illness, including two infants who died. In a statement on Wednesday, Abbott said it was hoping to restart the Sturgis factory in two weeks, pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Abbott added that baby formula would probably take six to eight weeks to reach stores. “We would begin production of EleCare, Alimentum and metabolic formulas first and then begin production of Similac and other formulas,” it said. The company insisted there is no evidence connecting its formula products to infant illness. While one pathogen linked to illness in children was found at the facility during environmental testing, Abbott said that it was found in “nonproduct contact areas of the facility and has not been linked to any known infant illness”. “In all four cases, the state, the FDA and/or CDC tested samples of the Abbott formula that was used by the child,” it said. “In all four cases, all unopened containers tested negative.” Nationwide, baby formula remains in short supply. During the week starting 24 April, 40% of baby formula was out of stock in more than 11,000 stores across the country, CNN and USA Today reported, compared with an out-of-stock percentage of 2% to 8% during the first half of 2021.

The poetry of Hölderlin, the writings of Robert Walser, the paintings of Louis Soutter and the music of Robert Schumann have previously all been the starting points for major Holliger scores, and in 2014 he composed a song cycle for the baritone Christian Gerhaher based on fragments of text by the Austrian Romantic poet Nikolaus Lenau (1802-1850), written during the final six years of his life, which were spent in an asylum. That Lenau song cycle provided Holliger with the framework for the opera Lunea, subtitled “Lenau scenes in 23 leaves from a life”, which received its premiere at the Zurich Opera in 2018 with Gerhaher as Lenau; the superb ECM recording, betraying no trace of audience noise, is taken from that run of performances. Händl Klaus’s libretto, in which the original song cycle fragments are embedded, depicts episodes from the poet’s life (including his trip to the US in 1832, and his attempt to start a new life there), but presents them in a non-narrative, entirely non-linear way, as if recalled randomly by Lenau in a dream. There are just five solo singers – three sopranos who play seven characters in Lenau’s life, and two baritones, one of whom is the poet, the other his alter ego Anton Xaver Schurz, who wrote a biography of Lenau, and was responsible for saving what survives of his final writings. A chorus of 12 voices echoes the protagonists, but though the sound world is hugely varied and imaginative, the ensemble of 14 players is only rarely used as a whole, so that the textures are always spare and chamber-like, the mood always intimate yet intense. Lenau was an accomplished violinist, and a solo violin features prominently in the score, with a cimbalom also prominent, adding its characteristic tang. As well as references to other composers and musical forms there’s a strong autobiographical element, with quotations from Holliger’s earlier works and from those of his teacher Sándor Veress, too, yet the intricate patchwork of musical, historical and literary allusions never overwhelms the central, tragic portrait of Lenau, which Gerhaher projects so potently. The rest of the cast is equally impressive, especially Ivan Ludlow as Schurz and Juliane Banse as Sophie von Löwenthal, a married women with whom Lenau had an intense though apparently platonic relationship. There’s no pretending that Lunea is an easy work to get on terms with, it’s never straightforward. But it is an immensely imaginative opera, full of very beautiful, fragile music.",Arts/Music,Holliger: Lunea review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/12/holliger-lunea-review-gerhaher-banse
5/13/2022,"More than 100 products containing cooked chicken – including sandwiches and wraps sold at Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Aldi, the Co-op, Pret a Manger and Marks & Spencer – have been removed from sale after a salmonella scare at a major supplier. Cranswick Country Foods said it had asked its customers to remove all their products containing its ready-to-eat chicken produced during a particular period after “a routine internal inspection” identified the presence of salmonella on a “limited number” of such products at its poultry processing plant in Hull. Items from Tesco’s One Stop convenience store chain, as well as Starbucks, Costa and Amazon are also among those potentially contaminated. The sandwich-maker Greencore said it was “moving quickly to alternative sources of supply in order to minimise any potential shortfall of products that may be affected”. Cranswick said in a statement that it was working with the Foods Standards Agency (FSA) to try to resolve the issue. “We are conducting a thorough investigation into the possible cause of the contamination and the site will remain closed until the investigations are complete,” the company said. “The safety and quality of every product produced by Cranswick is our number one priority and all necessary protocols will be followed and completed before we restart production.” The FSA advised anyone who had bought one of the potentially affected products not to eat it and to return it to the shop where it was purchased for a full refund. Retailers and cafes have issued lists of the affected items, including the use-by dates. Sainsbury’s said the supermarket was “sorry for any inconvenience” caused after recalling the majority of its premium Taste the Difference chicken sandwiches, chicken wraps and chicken sandwich platters, and some of its cooked chicken. Tesco said it was recalling a number of items including some chicken breast slices with a use-by date up to 20 May and fajita chicken breast mini-fillets with a use-by date up to 18 May. Waitrose said it was recalling 10 chicken sandwich and wrap lines with use-by dates up to and including 14 May. Marks & Spencer is recalling 12 items including roast chicken sandwiches, chicken salads and a mini-roll selection.",News/Business,UK supermarkets recall cooked chicken in salmonella scare,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/uk-supermarkets-salmonella-recall-cooked-chicken
