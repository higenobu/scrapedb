1/10/2022,"On the 14 June 2017, a fire broke out in the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block in north Kensington, west London, in the deadliest structural fire in the United Kingdom since the second world war – 72 people died and more than 70 were injured. ​​A government review into building regulations after the fire concluded that indifference and ignorance led to a “race to the bottom” in building safety practices, with cost prioritised over safety.  In 2019, the then chairman of the Grenfell inquiry panel, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, concluded that the “principal reason” the fire spread at such pace was down to combustible cladding with polyethylene cores, which acted as a “source of fuel”. In the wake of the tragedy the government established a building safety programme “ensuring that residents of high rise residential buildings are safe, and feel safe from the risk of fire, now and in the future”. A national ban was introduced on using combustible cladding on new buildings and sprinklers became mandatory on new-builds over 11 metres. A total of 461 high-rise residential buildings and publicly owned buildings were identified as having aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding such as that on Grenfell Tower, which had to be removed. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block. The full cost of fire safety work on all affected blocks has been estimated at about £15bn, by June last year the government had committed an estimated £5bn through the Building Safety Fund to remove flammable cladding on high-rise buildings. Under the leasehold system in England and Wales the cost is often borne by individual flat owners, some of whom have been left with spiralling insurance costs, service charges, and high fees for 24-hour “waking watch” fire patrols. After Grenfell ministers said building owners had to pay for the required fire safety measures, including the replacement of dangerous cladding. The government said it would meet the reasonable cost of the removal and replacement of unsafe cladding by councils and housing associations. Some owners have refused to carry out the work needed to make buildings safe. In May 2019 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), said the government “will fully fund the replacement of unsafe aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding on high-rise private residential properties where building owners have failed to do so”. Buildings between 11 metres and 18 metres were not covered by the Building Safety Fund, so ministers announced a loan scheme, through which leaseholders would repay a maximum of £50 a month. That was paused in November by the housing secretary, Michael Gove, who said he was “still unhappy” with the principle of leaseholders having to pay at all. Gove is expected to announce that leaseholders in buildings between 11 and 18 metres (36-60ft) tall will no longer have to take out loans to cover costs. Instead, he will try to make developers pay £4bn, according to a leaked Treasury letter reported by BBC Newsnight. But the Treasury letter states that approval for funding applies only to fixing cladding, meaning that leaseholders who are facing bills for defective fire compartmentation, fire doors and other non-cladding faults still face bills and uncertainty over whether mortgage companies will lend against their homes to make them sellable.",News/Society,"Five years after Grenfell, are all cladding victims now going to get help?",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/09/five-years-after-grenfell-are-all-cladding-victims-now-going-to-get-help
1/10/2022,"George Monbiot writes movingly about his despair in the face of environmental inaction (Watching Don’t Look Up made me see my whole life of campaigning flash before me, 4 January). It is possible to understand the strange lack of urgency by considering what George articulates elsewhere, namely that humanity is trapped in a consumer-capitalist system, whose effects are environmentally disastrous. The problem leading to pessimism is that changes to the fundamental belief systems of any culture must inevitably be very slow. The associated values are so taken for granted as the atmosphere of social existence, and shared as the basic assumptions of life, that it takes generations for cultures to change in their fundamentals. The disasters faced by the world, directly caused by our cultural values, are so serious and so imminent that change is needed immediately. However, change requires an alternative system of values to be adopted by humanity to create a new cultural context.  It is not possible to create cultural values intellectually and then impose them on a society; they only enter as a social presence by a process of organic growth. So the momentum of our predominant values, deep in our psyches, overwhelms the evidence of our peril and very effectively maintains the status quo, apart from a bit of tinkering. We are all collectively mad because we share the same intimate values, and the collective nature of our delusions both obscures reality and comforts us.Stephen SmithGlasgow  The problem is not so much the media, as George Monbiot suggests, as academia. Judged from the standpoint of helping us solve the climate crisis, academia is an intellectual and practical disaster. If academia was rationally and effectively devoted to helping us solve the climate crisis, and other global problems, it would give absolute intellectual priority to the tasks of articulating the problems, and proposing and critically assessing possible solutions. The pursuit of knowledge would be important, but secondary. A central task would be to engage actively with the public to promote action designed to solve the climate crisis – above all, put pressure on the government to act. But universities do not remotely proceed in such a way. They are devoted to the pursuit and application of knowledge; they do not take their primary task to be intelligently conducted public education about what our problems are, and what we need to do to solve them. As I have argued in book after book, article after article, for nearly 50 years, we face climate catastrophe because of the gross and profoundly damaging structural irrationality of academia, which prohibits giving priority to our all-important problems of living.Nicholas MaxwellScience and technology studies, University College London  I felt a deep empathy with George Monbiot’s frustration with the media. Last evening I stormed out of the room where my husband was watching the news because I was so frustrated at the relative unimportance of the main items. Where is the news about the progress, or lack of it, on the actions that should be taking place by world leaders on climate change? What can we do to make them sit up and take notice of Monbiot, and those like him, who tell us the painful truth? My fear and frustration are not for myself – I’m 80 – but for the following generations.

1/10/2022,"OK: blank sheet of thought-scap. How do we root-and-branch this? What are the bite-ables here? What, exactly, do our targeted people units want more of? When the England and Wales Cricket Board’s inevitable Ashes review gets round to the glorious oddity of day five of the fourth Test it is tempting to wonder exactly how those present will dice and slice the events of Sunday afternoon at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The last-ditch, non-result, dead-series Test match draw: there is no other substance quite like this in sport. It’s good. It’s great. It’s irresistible. But try to explain it, and it just kind of slips away.  Perhaps the heart of the thing was there in Jimmy Anderson’s walk to the crease after five days and 2,292 balls of the Sydney Test, after endless rain and endless rain chat, after men in shorts sprinting wildly to hammer a brown hessian sheet, as though only this, the brown hessian sheet, can preserve humanity from its inevitable late-civilisation collapse. After all those snaking narratives of players and careers, of falling and rising stars, after the transformation of that strip of grass from green, through brown and grey, to its final note of stately decay. With 10 minutes to play and one wicket to fall this was what we had left. Anderson walked out slowly, fiddling with straps, allowing his pupils to widen and the air to cool just a little. The key numbers at that point were 4, 2, 0, 2, 5, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 8, 1, 10, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 7, or the scores, with a fair few not outs, from Andersons’s last 23 Test innings (so you’re saying … there’s a 10 in there) from Galle to Sydney. Anderson would be facing Steve Smith, whose last Test wicket was five years ago in Perth. And the first real marvel of Sydney day five was that both teams still had the will to do this. By this stage in an Ashes series everyone here is running on bone marrow and spit. The series is gone. The walking injured are close to forming their own majority party. You can almost feel careers finding their own edges and end points. And yet somehow, as day came to an end in Sydney, none of this mattered. At moments such as these something seems to go wrong with the air, with the light above the stands, the clocks on the wall, all of it subsumed by those five-day tectonic forces. These are the best moments. How many more of them will we get? It seems fair to say the light saved Anderson. Probably Pat Cummins could have forced the game to this point a little quicker. How long would Anderson’s toenails have survived Mitchell Starc with the new-ish, hard-ish ball? How long is a very short piece of string? In the event it was the spirit of the village green, deus ex Paul Reiffel, that decided Smith and Nathan Lyon would bowl the final 12 balls. At which point, like the rest of that final hour, the whole thing dissolved into a series of vivid images. We remember the resistance of Stuart Broad, who came out hopping about and whirling his bat – game, ready, calm, cool, fooling no one – and immediately leapt into a comical defensive stoop as one kept low, bent double like a folding step ladder, that piece of wood tiny in his hands, a man batting with a ruler. With seven overs left Starc returned. Cue the extortionaryspectacle of Broad forcing every fibre to say yes to this thing, to obey his orders to leap into line with that fizzing, bone-crushing missile. Broad leapt back and across but still, by some stage magic, ended up cartwheeling towards square leg. He backflipped under a bouncer and got up with his jumper covered in scruff and mud. Without fear there can be no courage. Broad is a very brave man. This is not criticism. It’s applause. We know how this feels. Jack Leach was beautifully serene through most of this, oblivious to the howls, the banshee chuckles of the Australia’s close fielders. Leach wiped his glasses in response. Yes: it’s that. At one point he scored 23 off 17 balls. He whipped away a Cummins yorker with an ankle raised, an absurd piece of muscle memory, then eased Cummins’s final ball gloriously though mid-on Trescothick-style, perfectly balanced, head still. Wait. What? Smith got Leach with a beauty to summon Anderson from the pavilion. His two overs at the death were freakishly good. But Anderson played out the last six balls like a man whose bat was welded to his pad, unable to imagine any other movement but full-body defence. Even the reactions from the players were a perfect read of the day. England’s handshakes and hugs were fond and low-key. The only real congratulations were from Australia’s players, who were winning this match in every single moment right up to that final one, but showed real grace at the end. Nothing changes in the wider picture. A draw in Sydney may provide the tiniest merkin to a disastrous tour. But Australia are still a much better cricket team, even if that gap narrowed as England overcame some of the hurdles placed by their own management. There had been some fears voiced that England’s players might be fatally thrown by the absence of their Covid-addled coaching staff. Hmm. Are we talking about the same coaching staff? Much can be taken from the heart and the spleen of the players in providing this spectacle. Jonny Bairstow was gloriously defiant in both innings. Ben Stokes showed familiar grit, striking a disco-strut hand-on-hip pose after every forward prop, product of those poor battered ribs. Earlier in the day there was the promise of a brisk, clean, fearless 77 from Zak Crawley, plus the spectacle of those wonderful twin Waqar-style yorkers summoned up by Cummins to get rid of Mark Wood and Jos Buttler. And in the end this was probably the takeaway, the voice speaking quietly under all this action: a comfortable, leathery voice, the voice of Test Cricket as narrated by a particularly wise and benevolent John Hurt. A voice telling you that if you build it they will come, that this thing is good, that while it may be difficult and hard to package, the time to start worrying is when your product doesn’t have this brilliance to sell. England will now decamp to Hobart. The wounded will be packed off home. Sam Billings may or may not have finished his story tape collection during the Covid-bubble road trip to a likely Test debut (cut to the voice of John Hurt – “if you build it they will come” – as Bilbo, in shades, checks his mirrors). And right now the final dead Test of this done-and-dusted series feels strangely alive.",Sport/Sport,"It’s good. It’s great. It’s irresistible.

1/10/2022,"Steve Bell, Keith Flett (Letters, 5 January) and Simon Jenkins (‘Sir Tony Blair’? How cheaply knighthoods come in our broken honours system, 5 January) represent a formidable trio to engage in a quarrel for which few Guardian readers would choose to build the barricades: the elevation of a discredited former prime minister to an outdated institution through a corrupted honours system. Nonetheless, there is arguably a danger in acquiescing in the attack on Tony Blair orchestrated by the press and others on the right that is greater than marching to the front in a lost cause. The case rests on the motives behind this denigration and its intended outcomes. The right have no particular quarrel with bellicosity, under-regulation of financial markets or lucrative consultancies in Kazakhstan.  The real – but concealed – target of their attack is the substantial body of achievement under New Labour: restoring the NHS, rebuilding schools and colleges, establishing Sure Start and committing, more broadly, to an idea of social justice that has since been sacrificed. Equally important, one of Blair’s finest achievements was surely the Belfast agreement, reflecting his tireless energy and ability to engage with the key players. Since Brexit requires either a border across the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea, the posturings of Lord Frost and now Liz Truss pose a real threat to the agreement, and those that support this manifest folly have a vested interest in pretending there is nothing substantial to lose. The attack on Blair is surely designed to airbrush his most historic achievement out of the record altogether. For no other reason than that, Sir Tony Blair deserves our unwavering support.Paul ClarkeHorsham, West Sussex  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/10/2022,"The life of my brother Adrian Crilly, who has died aged 70, began with great academic promise, but unhappily his aspirations were frustrated. Born in Bristol, the son of Alexander, a school science teacher, and Vera, a secretary, Adrian was the youngest in a family of four children. He was educated at St Brendan’s college in the city and progressed to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to study English. Early on in his course he was overtaken by mental health problems and these cut short his time at Cambridge and remained with him for the rest of his life.  He worked for a short period at the Bristol Royal Infirmary as a porter, but his health circumstances precluded sustained employment. He lived in the Bedminster district of Bristol for nearly 50 years intermittently broken by periods in hospitals and mental health institutions. Adrian was an imaginative child who created and inhabited a make-believe world, including his town of “Kegworth”, where he managed its football team and charted its movement up and down a league table. At St Brendan’s he was inspired by teachers of English literature and the history of art. He became an accomplished artist in oils and showed an attraction to poetry, Thomas Hardy being among his favourites. While at Caius he was taught by the modern poet JH Prynne, whose work he admired. In Bedminster he was most content with life around his books, and he accumulated a large library. He was a keen motorcyclist, but an abiding image is of him chain-smoking with a poetry book six inches from his nose, oblivious of his surroundings. His early love of English literature and his knowledge of it remained undimmed. He was completely impractical and lived, at first with a friend and later alone, in a ramshackle Victorian house which needed upkeep but never received it. He felt at home in the Bedminster village, where people knew him – in second-hand bookshops, coffee shops and at the local Windmill City farm, where he helped out from time to time. Later his health problems became more acute and in 2017 he moved to a care home, where his reclusive life of study continued. In the summer of 2021 he had a stroke. He is survived by his siblings, Andrew, Veronica and me.",Arts/Books,Adrian Crilly obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/09/adrian-crilly-obituary
1/10/2022,"Jonathan Malesic’s article (Your work is not your god: welcome to the age of the burnout epidemic, 6 January) sheds vital light on the psychological contract between public sector employees, their employers and society. Meaningful work and public recognition are vital to their wellbeing and sense of purpose. How else can we explain why so many nurses and doctors have remained in post despite the burgeoning workload and pay freezes of the past decade? How else can we understand why anyone would endure the gruelling conditions on Covid wards day after day? Boris Johnson forgets this at our peril. When he opines that hospital staff “may feel overwhelmed” it must seem like a slap in the face. Desperate social media posts from the frontline indicate that we are burning out the people we need most. When cheese and wine are consumed by ministers and their staff on grassy lawns behind the prime minister’s flat in the May sunshine, we must all wonder why kudos, comfort and recognition flow more freely to the privileged than to the productive members of the national workforce.

1/10/2022,"Facing accusations of confusing messaging about the Omicron Covid surge, a senior Biden administration official was forced on to the back foot on Sunday by a supreme court justice’s mistaken remark about hospitalisations among children.  During oral arguments over a vaccinations mandate for private employers, the liberal justice Sonya Sotomayor said on Friday the US had “over 100,000 children, which we’ve never had before, in serious condition and many on ventilators”. Reporters were swift to point out she was wrong. Though concern about children and Omicron is widespread, the Washington Post cited official data in saying there were “about 5,000 children hospitalised … either with suspected Covid or a confirmed laboratory test”. According to Johns Hopkins University, more than 836,000 people have died of Covid in the US. More than 206 million Americans, or 62.5% of the eligible population, are considered fully vaccinated. The Covid response has been dogged by resistance to vaccines and other public health measures stoked by politicians and rightwing media prominently including Fox News. Nonetheless, critics charge that official messaging has become muddled, not least over the recent decision to cut recommended quarantine from 10 days to five, and confusion about when or if the infected should test again. Earlier this week, it was reported that Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was undergoing media training. She also told told reporters she was “committed to improve” communications. Walensky was interviewed on Fox News Sunday. In Bret Baier, she faced perhaps Fox’s toughest interviewer, after the departure of Chris Wallace. It was not an easy experience. Baier asked: “The supreme court is in the process of dealing with this big issue about mandates. Do you feel it is the responsibility of the CDC director to correct a very big mischaracterisation by one of the supreme court justices?” “Yeah,” said Walensky. “Here’s what I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you that right now, if you’re unvaccinated, you’re 17 times more likely to be in the hospital and 20 times more likely to die than if you’re boosted. “And so my responsibility is to provide guidance and recommendations to protect the American people. Those recommendations strongly recommend vaccination for our children above the age of five and boosting for everyone above the age of 18 if they’re eligible.” Baier asked if the administration knew how many children were on ventilators. “I do not have that off the top of my head,” Walensky said. “But what I can say is I don’t believe there are any in many of these hospitals who are vaccinated. “So really, the highest risk of being on a ventilator for a child is if you’re unvaccinated. We also have recent data out just this week that’s demonstrated that dangerous MIS-C syndrome that we’re seeing in children, 91% protection if you’ve been vaccinated.” Baier said: “The risk of death or serious illness in children is still very small, right?” Walensky said: “Comparatively, the risk of death is small. But of course, you know, children are not supposed to die. So you know, if we have a child who is sick with Covid-19, we want to protect them.” Baier said: “Officially, you emphasise that one of your primary goals was to restore public trust, but do you think it’s fair to say that the trust and confidence of the public has gone down with the CDC?” “You know,” Walensky said, “this is hard. We have ever-evolving science with an ever-evolving variant and my job is to provide updated advice in the context of rapidly rising cases. And that is what we’ve done and I’m here to explain it to the American people and I am committed to continuing to do so and to continuing to improve.” Baier said: “We appreciate you coming on, we really do. Just getting facts out there.” Most observers think the supreme court, tilted 6-3 in favour of conservatives after three appointments under Donald Trump, seems likely to strike down the workplace mandate. The rule is due to come into effect on Monday. Baier said: “The questioning in the supreme court also said that Omicron was as deadly as Delta. That is not true, right?” Walensky said: “We are starting to see data from other countries that indicate on a person-by-person basis it may not be. However, given the volume of cases that we’re seeing with Omicron we very well may see death rates rise dramatically.” Asked if mandates for private employers or government employees including members of the armed forces were necessary if prior infection conferred protection, Walensky said: “I think the thing that’s most disruptive to any business or industry has to have half their workforce out because they’re sick with Covid.” Such is the case in New York City, where essential services are struggling for staff. “We have seen with the Omicron variant,” Walensky added, “that prior infection protects you less well than it had … with prior variants. “Right now, I think the most important thing to do is to protect Americans. We do that by getting them vaccinated and getting them boosted.”",News/US news,Biden health chief endures Fox News grilling over mixed Covid messaging,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/cdc-rochelle-walensky-fox-news-sunday-sotomayor-children-covid
1/10/2022,"British online retail company THG has handed information to regulators over what its billionaire founder Matthew Moulding has described as a coordinated attack on its share price. THG, formerly known as the Hut Group, shared data with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) related to what it claims is irregular trading of its shares.  THG floated as one of the UK’s most prominent tech successes, but it has endured a torrid 12 months after investors questioned its value. After rising from a value of £5.6bn after its first day on the London Stock Exchange to £13bn in January 2021, it plunged in the autumn and on Friday stood at £2.8bn. Most of THG’s earnings come from retail websites such as make-up seller Lookfantastic and sports nutrition site MyProtein. Moulding had pinned his hopes on the growth of Ingenuity, a division building direct-to-consumer websites for other companies but that unravelled when shares slumped by a third following a presentation he made to investors . It is understood some of the data shared by THG with the FCA related to trading patterns on 12 October, the day of a large share price drop. The data handover was first reported by the Sunday Times. Moulding has said THG was subjected to a “pretty aggressive short attack” and likened shorting (in which investors bet on share prices falling) to robbing a bank, in an interview last year with GQ magazine. The company has so far made public little evidence to back up its claim of a coordinated attack. THG handed over data after the regulator approached it as part of inquiries into the actions of a salesperson at Numis, a City of London stockbroker. Numis had been one of the investment banks running THG’s initial public offering in September 2020, but its analysts’ view of the company turned negative. In October 2021, following Moulding’s investor presentation, a Numis analyst ascribed a value of 235p to shares. Their value fell to 194p on Friday. In November, shortly after THG shares hit a record low but several weeks after the initial slump, a Numis salesperson sent clients a note on THG that included references to “irregularities in accounting”. However, Numis quickly retracted what it described as “inaccuracies” in the note and removed the reference to accounting irregularities. A Numis spokesperson in November confirmed that the company had corrected the note to clients and apologised. Numis declined to comment further.

1/10/2022,"The home knit is having a moment this winter as the “Tom Daley effect” sees more young men and women picking up knitting needles to create “slow” fashion. Figures show that about 1 million people have taken up the hobby since the start of the pandemic, and the Olympic gold medal-winner turned supercrafter has launched a new range that could encourage yet more to take it up.  Since being seen knitting at the Tokyo Games, Daley has become a craft influencer whose dedicated Instagram page attracts 1.4m followers. He now has a collection of high-end knitting kits for sale on the website LoveCrafts. The kits, aimed at beginners, include a £90 pullover with on-trend Varsity stripes and a £125 unisex jumper with a flamingo on the front. The hefty price tags in part reflect the cost of the thick merino wool, which, it says, is “ethically sourced” in the UK. In 2020, newly locked-down Britons filled time at home baking banana bread and sourdough. But by 2021, with the realisation that they were in it for the long haul, the focus shifted to crafting as many sought to stave off home-working burnout. The UK Hand Knitting Association (UKHKA) said about 1 million people have taken up knitting since the start of the pandemic. The figure, based on last year’s Craft Intelligence report, means the country now has around 7 million knitters. The sight of Daley winning medals without dropping a stitch has encouraged more men to get involved, says UKHKA spokesperson Juliet Bernard. A quarter of the people using its site, which supports independent wool shops, were now men, she said, up from about 10% before the Olympic Games. Daley’s national treasure status propelled needles and wool into the 2021 John Lewis retail report, which identified the major shopping trends. Sales of yarn increased “ridiculously” during the pandemic, said Bernard, who suggested people had cottoned on to the “meditative quality” of knitting. Daley says the hobby helped him to his medal haul, describing knitting as his “secret weapon”. During the pandemic, hobbies acted as a “safety valve for many Britons, offering solace and escape”, according to a recent report by market researchers Mintel. However, when it comes to knitting and sewing, two in five people said they were doing it to save money, while a similar number cited environmental reasons. Described as “slow” fashion, this DIY approach is seen as an antidote to harmful high-street fast fashion. Edward Griffith, the LoveCrafts chief executive, said sales at the company hit £66m last year. The new Covid wave meant things were “busier again”, said Griffith, who describes crafting as a “winter sport”. In December, sales of knitting and crochet kits on the site were 225% up on 2019. While knitting’s traditional heartland was among women in their 40s or 50s, Daley was attracting younger customers as well as a male audience, he added. Not everyone will be able to carry off Daley’s fashion-forward designs, which cost as much as buying the finished article, but Bernard said they would appeal to the Zoom generation. “You’ve got on your PJ bottoms and this glorious, extravagant, jumper on top,” she said. “People are worn out by what’s happened over the last few years. They want cocooning, but they also want a bit of fun.” The Covid “pet baby boom”, which has sent sales of animal lifestyle products into overdrive, means dogs as well as humans are being showered with luxurious knits. The crafting site Ravelry, for example, has more than 400 different patterns for dog coats. While children’s knits can be bought on the high street for less than the balls of wool needed to make them, there is an enduring demand for patterns. “That is one way that people still seem to express their love,” said Bernard.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Tom Daley effect’ spurs men to take up knitting amid home crafting boom,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/09/tom-daley-effect-spurs-men-to-take-up-knitting-amid-home-crafting-boom

But leaseholders in buildings with other fire-safety problems – such as wooden balconies – will still face huge bills, and campaigners will urge Gove to help these people to finally draw a line underthe crisis. “This feels like it could be the beginning of the end of our cladding scandal, but we are still a long way away from solving it,” said Giles Grover, a spokesperson for the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign group. “The government is still focusing on cladding but they know full well it goes beyond that. People are still facing life-changing costs.” People have been landed with bills of up to £200,000 each in the worst cases. Many blocks have combustible cladding but also problems with defective fire doors, flammable balconies and missing firebreaks because of non-compliant building works. But under the new Treasury-approved plan, whichdiverts up to £4bn in existing government budgets, only cladding remediation costs will be covered. Campaigners want a change to the law to protect them from all costs caused by fire safety defects that were not their fault. The latest funding will add to the £5.1bn already announced to pay to fix combustible cladding on apartment blocks over 18m in height. Yet the cost of fixing all post-Grenfell fire safety problems was last year estimated by MPs at £15bn – and it may be even higher. Gove will say that the government will claw back the £4bn funding from developers and builders, and, if they don’t pay, the government will legislate to force them to pay up. In the meantime, the Treasury has made clear the funds will have to be diverted from the Department of Levelling Up’s existing budget, according to a letter leaked to BBC Newsnight. However, construction lobbyists argue firms that manufactured or supplied combustible cladding should also shoulder some of the financial burden. The Home Builders Federation (HBF) said the largest housebuilders had already spent or committed £1bn to fix the buildings for which they were responsible. Stewart Baseley, the HBF’s executive chairman, said: “Whilst housebuilders are committed to playing their part, there are many other organisations involved in the construction of affected buildings, including housing associations and local authorities. “As well as developers and government, other parties should be involved in remediation costs, not least material manufacturers who designed, tested and sold materials that developers purchased in good faith that were later proved to not be fit for purpose.” Ministers could end up paying millions of pounds if developers cannot be identified. For instance, foreign developers often set up UK shell companies that share out work between subcontractors, then dissolve once it is finished. In other cases developers may have since gone bust, meaning there is no corporate entity to target. If the Treasury does not give the housing department more money to cover the costs of remediation for buildings with no obvious developer, it could eat into the government’s budget for other projects to increase the supply of new homes, an industry source warned. Gove’s expected announcements were cautiously welcomed by leaseholders who feel a solution may be finally be in sight, after many have suffered serious mental health problems in the intervening years. Homeowners have been trapped in unsellable, in effect worthless homes, which has destroyed plans to move jobs, have children and marry. Striking a more aggressive tone than his predecessors, Gove is set to say: “Those who manufactured dangerous products and developed dangerous buildings have shown insufficient contrition.” He is planning to signal a new “proportionate” attitude to risk and, crucially, will scrap post-Grenfell advice from the government that all residential block wall systems need checking for possible removal and replacement, regardless of building height. He will say sprinklers and fire alarms should be used more often to mitigate risks instead of expensive remediation works. The government will also start auditing assessments of the risks posed by buildings to make sure expensive fixes are only being proposed where lives are at risk. Gove’s intervention comes ahead of former ministers facing questioning at the Grenfell Tower public inquiry overclaims Conservative-led governments prioritised a “bonfire of red tape” over safety. Labour’s shadow housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, said: “On the face of it, these proposals appear far less significant than they sound.” He added: “There is nothing new for the significant numbers of leaseholders facing huge bills to fix non-cladding defects; no guarantee that the cost of remediating buildings under 18 metres won’t be drawn from already allocated public funding; no help for the countless leaseholders currently mired in mortgage chaos.”",News/Society,Gove must spend ‘billions more’ to end building fire safety crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/09/gove-must-spend-billions-more-end-building-fire-safety-crisis
1/10/2022,"Football can be oh so cruel. For much of the afternoon, Charlton of League One sensed an upset. Norwich may be a top-flight club in name only, but defeat for them at the Valley would still have been a shock of sorts. But in the end, a pair of substitutes vital to Norwich’s slim survival hopes combined to spare their blushes, Teemu Pukki crossing for Milot Rashica to tap home. It ended the Canaries’ spectacular 541-minute barren run in front of goal.  Charlton’s manager, Johnnie Jackson, was patrolling the midfield last time Charlton got past this stage of the competition. He can take some comfort in the fact that his players acquitted themselves well on the first occasion they have hosted Premier League opponents since exiting the division a decade and a half ago. Pride then, but not progression. The opening 20 minutes severely lacked creativity until the Norwich centre-back Ozan Kabak seized the initiative. Kabak may have a reputation for verging on the over-adventurous, but his foray forward was most welcome here. Kabak travelled deep into Charlton territory and had yellow shirts flanking him on both sides but was halted abruptly by a fine sliding challenge from Ryan Inniss, who was playing due to the ineligibility of Akin Famewo against his parent club. A rapid counter came, and within seconds Elliot Lee cut inside and curled the game’s first shot past a full-stretch Tim Krul but narrowly past the post too. Belief grew on three sides of the Valley. Quite right too: despite the absence of their two leading goalscorers Jayden Stockley and Conor Washington, Charlton carried much of the attacking threat. Diallang Jaiyesimi, who did not make a first-team appearance in more than four years at Carrow Road, gave the left-back Dimitris Giannoulis such a torrid time that Giannoulis was replaced at the break, while Lee was at the heart of all Charlton’s best attacking work. Jonathan Leko wasted a gilt-edged chance to grab the opener after Lee got away down the left and squared. The forward, despite little by way of defensive attention, managed to lift his effort high and wide from six yards. Alex Gibley was the next to try his luck, firing low from 20 yards; an awkward bounce meant Krul did well to parry for a corner. A penny was not required for the thoughts of the 2,200-strong travelling contingent in the Jimmy Seed stand. For the second time in less than a fortnight, after the 3-0 league defeat at Crystal Palace, they had travelled to south London to watch a side lacking in quality, cohesion and – unforgivably – endeavour. Amid the gallows humour – “we’ve had a shot” was audible as Kenny McLean drove their only attempt of the half over the bar – there were murmurings of discontent directed at Delia Smith. Daniel Podence bagged two and Nélson Semedo was also on the scoresheet as Wolves breezed into the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 3-0 win over Sheffield United at Molineux. Wolves were given a couple of reprieves following some uncharacteristically disjointed defending early on but Podence opened the scoring inside the first quarter of an hour and, from there, the hosts hardly looked back. They had to wait until the 72nd minute for Semedo to double their lead before Podence grabbed his second soon after, the forward's first goals since scoring in the Carabao Cup defeat against Tottenham on 22 September. Billy Sharp thought he had equalised before half-time but the goal was chalked off for a high foot as the Blades endured an unhappy return to the ground where their relegation from the Premier League last season was confirmed. Nathan Jones was happy to see his Luton side shake off their ring rust as they cruised past Harrogate 4-0 to move into the fourth round of the FA Cup. The Hatters went into the game having not played for 29 days due to outbreaks of Covid but, despite their lack of action, they eased home thanks to goals from Elijah Adebayo, Cameron Jerome, Kal Naismith and Luke Berry. Jones said: ""We haven't played any football in a month, we've given them a big week this week in terms of training and in numbers as we've got to get up to speed, so it was a gamble … We've managed to win the game 4-0, so it's not a bad world is it?"" Mark Harris fired a late extra-time winner as Cardiff beat Preston 2-1 in the Welsh capital. Harris's first goal in the competition came with the third-round tie just four minutes from a penalty shootout. Isaak Davies, another of the Bluebirds' young guns, had earlier scored his first senior goal before Daniel Johnson's penalty put Preston back on terms. Davies' strike after 42 minutes was a particularly sweet moment for the Wales Under-21 international. Cardiff's manager, Steve Morison, had described Davies as being more ""a hindrance than a help"" after sending him on as a substitute at Bournemouth only to replace him within 30 minutes. Tom Ince's first-half goal and a late Tyrese Campbell strike earned Stoke a 2-0 win over Leyton Orient. Ince netted three minutes from half-time and then provided the pass for substitute Campbell to settle the contest in the 89th minute. PA Media Dean Smith had seen enough. Alongside the introduction of Brandon Williams at half-time came that of Pukki and Rashica. But, initially at least, they failed to change the direction of the wind. Lee forced Krul to save with his feet, and the 18-year-old full-debutant Mason Burstow visibly grew in confidence as he got a pair of strikes away in short order. Up went the volume. Pukki’s first involvement, on the other hand, was to pass to no one. And when McLean failed to sort his feet when presented with a golden chance to strike from dead centre shortly afterwards, it felt like Norwich’s afternoon was going to be fruitless. To their credit though they improved slightly, Josh Sargent twisting, turning and rolling wide. “That’s why you’re going down,” became the afternoon’s most popular refrain. With a rearranged league visit to West Ham in 72 hours, Smith wanted extra time like he wanted a hole in the head. The relief was palpable when Rashica grabbed what proved the decisive intervention. Finally, supporters in yellow had something to celebrate. Chants regarding a trip to Wembley began immediately. Stephen Henderson then denied Pierre Lees-Melou and Max Aarons’ attempts to add a second, and those stops almost proved vital, but Chris Gunter’s late header slammed against the bar. And that, for Charlton, was that.",Sport/Football,Milot Rashica strikes late as Norwich edge past unlucky Charlton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/charlton-norwich-fa-cup-match-report
1/10/2022,"“If it’s your job to eat a frog, you’d better do it first thing in the morning” is a bit of wisdom attributed to Mark Twain that has inspired many an entrepreneurial go-getter. But in my 37 years of endeavour, procrastination, discipline and punishment, one thing I have learned is that even the worst days are infinitely better if you start them not by swallowing the frog, but by being just a little bit kind to yourself. Consider: which activities bring you joy? What’s your idea of bliss or comfort? What do you do to feel most like yourself? Now, imagine: what if that blissful, comforting, singular joy was the thing you woke up to?  Maybe your joy is having a bubble bath. What if you started having them first thing in the morning, in the quiet, before anyone else in the house was awake? Maybe it’s lying on the couch, reading a poem. What if you did that with your coffee in the morning sun? Maybe it’s listening to your favourite heavy metal song at ear-splitting volume. Maybe it’s sketching, or throwing a stick for the dog, or staying in bed, doing other bedtime things. I think many of us are doing mornings all wrong. We’ve been telling ourselves that because they so often involve gruel and grind, this is what they must always be. But that is kind of the point, because even with the tightest schedule and the most soul-destroying list of tasks to accomplish, it’s all the more difficult and important to tend to your soul – to make time for your own desires, joys, pleasures. My advice is: do that first. Very first. For five minutes, if that’s all you have. My joys are fairly small, like reading a good novel and knitting, sometimes both at once. Frequently, now, these are the first things I do when I wake up. Even on workdays. Especially on workdays. Sometimes I get up earlier so I can do them – it’s the closest I get to the childlike joy of knowing when I open my eyes there will be a treat under the tree. Yes, I know the frog is waiting – maybe a whole pond of them – but it’s so much easier to get out of bed knowing that between the frog and me sits a little slice of pure joy.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: five minutes of fun before the work day begins – ‘it’s the closest I get to childlike joy’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/10/easy-wins-five-minutes-of-fun-before-the-work-day-begins-its-the-closest-i-get-to-childlike-joy
1/10/2022,"Raising my daughter through this teenage stage is scary and I don’t know if I will get through it These years in the thick of raising teenagers are a little like the first years of parenthood. You, once again, feel overwhelmed and incompetent. There is also the aloneness.  Sometimes, when I admit to another parent that this is hard, harder than I expected, they lower their heads near mine and, with eyes widened, whisper urgently about something very worrying they are contending with as a parent. Their voices convey the relief of an honest conversation but also, the ache of big problems that cannot be immediately fixed for a child. The aloneness we felt when we were raising babies was about maintaining the facade that babies weren’t softening us too much or that the days were filled with nothing but joy. Now, the aloneness is about being discreet. Teenagers have a right to privacy and rebirth as they muddle along. While adolescent impulsiveness is entirely predictable, poor choices are still judged very harshly by the rest of the world. I do not know if the world is getting more complex to raise teenagers in or if it has long been this fraught. I don’t know, because like I said, no one talks about this part of parenting with much real honesty. I recently asked a close friend for advice. She was facing a tough time of her own as a mother, but she said, reassuringly, it is probably like that book we read over and over to our children when they were little: We’re Going on a Bear Hunt. In the book, a young family go on an adventure to find a bear. The plot resembles the motivations you fabricate to keep the energy of small children up on long walks. We are walking, why? To find a bear, of course. When you are walking with small children even the simplest of walks present challenges. Every bit of mud or water that you manage to get through without a child falling over in it feels like an achievement. So, it always made sense to me that the book focuses more on the obstacles of the walk than the dangers of a bear. And each time the family is deterred by new terrain, the book repeats the mantra: we can’t go over it, we can’t go under it, we’ve got to go through it. When I used to read that story to my children, I assumed its appeal lay in the whimsical sense of drama and sing-song lessons in prepositions and spatial concepts. But maybe the book was written for parents? Rereading it as the mother of a 16-year-old daughter, it seems obvious that its true purpose is imprinting a script for living. And so, I now look with curiosity at the depictions of mother and daughter in the book. In one part of the story the family are making their way through an overgrown field. The mother and the little daughter, with their arms stretched towards one another, are holding hands but are swallowed chest-deep into long grass. Is the daughter showing her mother the way or is the mother helping her daughter through the grass? We cannot assume by this stage of parenting teenagers that we, as parents, always know what is best. I am reminded of a quietly haunting poem by Lucille Clifton, My Mama moved among the days, describing the experience of being the child of a mother who is unravelling. The mother does her best – “she got us almost through the high grass” – before tragically succumbing to something terrible inside herself and running back into the grass alone. My own experience with mothering a teenage daughter is that there is a lot of push-pull. She still wants to hold my hand, but she is insistent that she knows the right way ahead through the long grass. So, when I look at that illustration in the Bear Hunt story, I see a mother trying to pull her daughter back from a dangerous course. I try to explain this fear to my daughter carefully, so as not to offend her. How it feels to not only be scared, as a parent, but also unexpectedly powerless. My daughter and I were walking our dogs off-leash, when I told her about a fear in the United States, real or imaginary, that dogs can be lured away from their owners by coyotes. Whether the dog follows a coyote for play or out of bravado, we cannot say, but the result is they underestimate the small, impish creature until finding themselves isolated and surrounded by a pack of them. Then, far from their owner’s protection, they are killed. Her mouth dropped in horror. That is how it sometimes feels to be a parent, I told her. I am trying to call you back, to warn you of the dangers in the world, but you are disappearing into the long grass. Of course, my daughter is not like a pet. She is not mine; she is becoming her own person. And I deliberately sought not to raise my daughter to be too fearful of the world, lest she curb her participation in it as a young woman. But the youthful underestimation, my corresponding powerlessness and the collision of all this with a world not as kind as I hoped for my children are proving to be a daunting combination for me as a mother. What to do? When I am feeling engulfed, I remember the instruction of the book. The resistance and avoidance are their own pain. Reaching acceptance – that I will have to go through this and do the hard work involved – is the only way for me to get to the other side. My friend, if this is you too, I have these words for you: keep going.

1/10/2022,"As the Sex and the City finale aired in 2004, another television fantasy of female friendship dreamed up by a gay man was just beginning. But where Carrie and her BFFs live a “you go girl” life of cosmopolitans and Manolos, Marc Cherry’s Desperate Housewives inhabit the decidedly darker universe of Wisteria Lane. Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) is a single mum with the fittingly quaint profession of children’s book illustrator. Her neighbours Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross), Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) and Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) are homemakers. They’re also financially dependent on their husbands, so are forced to exert power in subversive and sometimes downright violent ways. Cherry was inspired to create the show after watching a news report on Andrea Yates, a Texan housewife who drowned her five kids in a bathtub while suffering from postpartum psychosis. While Desperate Housewives immediately drew large audiences, critics were unsure how to categorise it. Was it a drama, mystery, comedy or merely a trashy soap? Speaking to Vanity Fair in 2005, Hatcher and James Denton, who plays Susan’s partner Mike, rejected the soap opera label, for its association with “bad lighting, bad writing, [and] bad acting”. To the contrary, Desperate Housewives is superbly acted, slickly produced and packed with delightfully acerbic lines. Yet, it’s the show’s highly stylised theatricality – its “soapy” elements – that both drew me to it as a teenager and make it so enduringly fun nearly two decades on.  The plot is by no means believable: the first season alone sees suicide, infanticide, murder, blackmail and not one, but two house fires. But no one watches narrative television for the humdrum of real life! We watch for the theatre of Gabrielle mowing the lawn in a ball gown and stilettos in the dead of the night, so her husband doesn’t find out she’s sleeping with their teenage gardener. And for the macabre hijinks of town busybody Mrs Huber, who is so jealous of her perfect neighbour Bree’s lawn that, when a jogger collapses outside her house, she dumps the body on Bree’s hydrangeas rather than call 911. The show’s success proved that a fantastical spin on the lives of housewives – albeit unreasonably hot ones – was meaty and compelling enough to sustain a primetime audience’s attention. Beneath its fairy floss exterior, Desperate Housewives explores the deep sadness, thwarted hopes and simmering rage that often afflicts women confined to the domestic sphere. Season one begins with the death of Mary Alice Young who, despite her “perfect life”, felt compelled to blow her brains out with a pistol one pleasant afternoon. While Bree, Gabrielle, Lynette and Susan are shocked and confused by her death, they all understand her desperation more than they let on. In one memorable scene, Lynette, who is overwhelmed by her children and coming down hard from the ADD medication she’s been stealing from them, suddenly sees her dead friend bathed in a halo of white light. Looking calm and peaceful, Mary Alice hands over the pistol she used to kill herself and smiles encouragingly as Lynette guides it to her own head, to the sound of Simon and Garfunkel’s Feelin’ Groovy. This grim scene is one of Desperate Housewives’ many allusions to the fragile and tenuous nature of family life. Clocking eight seasons, Desperate Housewives is still the longest running hour-long scripted series with all-female leads. The tentacles of its legacy are far-reaching, as it inspired the behemoth Real Housewives reality franchise. In the opening credits of The Real Housewives of Orange County, which premiered in 2006, the women hold oranges in their hands, an homage to the biblical apples featured in the credits of Desperate Housewives. Both shows use glamour and wealth as a Trojan horse to offer a complex, moving exploration of the many joys and humiliations of middle-aged womanhood. But while betrayal, infidelity and financial ruin are par for the course on Real Housewives, reality is yet to deliver the murderous twists and turns of Wisteria Lane.",Arts/Culture,"Desperate Housewives: soapy, superbly acted and still fun, nearly 20 years on",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/10/desperate-housewives-soapy-superbly-acted-and-still-fun-nearly-20-years-on
1/10/2022,"Reflective of a broader Australian conversation, talk around the A-Leagues’ response to Omicron and its flood of postponements has predominantly been framed as a logistical and financial challenge. But for coaching, medical and sports science staff, it is also a very real and uncertain health challenge. Prior to the emergence of the latest variant, the A-Leagues – like most Australian sports – had been able to avoid Covid-19 seeping into their ranks. Due to a combination of societal restrictions, biosecurity measures and sheer fortune, the virus existed as some sort of malignant, external force – shutting down leagues and forcing games behind closed doors but, for the most part, staying out of dressing rooms.  But now, the call is coming from inside the house. Australian football is proving no more immune to the highly communicable variant than any other segment of society, leaving coaches and players across the leagues to come to the conclusion that it is simply a matter of time until the virus rips through their dressing rooms. The past week’s fixtures were again decimated by postponements resulting from at least five players returning positive tests. Fortunately, the greater physical base elite athletes possess and superior levels of monitoring and care they can access puts professional footballers – who are all vaccinated apart from a small handful of players – in a strong position. The likelihood of an A-Leagues player developing serious complications from the virus are slim – even if acute presentations can still be worrying. “I copped it pretty hard,” Melbourne City and Socceroos attacker Andrew Nabbout said. “The first couple of days in training was very difficult, trying to get back into it. I felt really strong before it happened and I was able to bounce back pretty quickly, but the first couple of days really hit me hard.” Footballers, as a rule, are in much better condition than the general population but their working conditions are also far more taxing; a sharp contrast exists between getting out of quarantine and being able to perform in an elite sporting competition after suffering from a respiratory infection. In the weeks and months ahead, players who return to action following infection will not only have to deal with a series of short turnarounds to make up for fixtures postponed by outbreaks, but also the dog days of summer. “For [players to return to training], we have to get the players in to do some moderate-intensity exercise and we’ll look at some heart rate data on that,” Tim Knight, the head of performance at Central Coast Mariners, who had 14 players contract Covid, said. “The doctors want to see the heart rate data and how they respond to that. We have baseline data from pre-Covid so the doctors are able to compare post-Covid to pre-Covid and see if there are any abnormalities in response. Then there’s usually an interview asking about symptoms hanging around and once he’s happy that they’re able to return he’ll give them the all-clear [for a staggered return to full training]. “Sometimes players can hide things from coaches if they think it’s going to impact selection but with our games being postponed we’ve really got the information across that this is about returning to health. We understand this period might be challenging so they need to be really honest with us.” The leagues’ anticipated fixture postponement pile-up will begin abating next week, but the long-term ramifications of the current wave of infections around the league – including the dreaded spectre of long Covid – remains unclear. “The hard thing is, it’s a medical condition. I didn’t really finish school, I don’t really know,” said City coach Patrick Kisnorbo. “That’s why it’s so hard to know exactly what will happen physically with the player. You’ve just got to judge it as you see it. If they’re OK, they’re OK but I know personally we have to adapt and treat it on its merit.” In a recent study, researchers examined the lasting impact of Covid in Serie A and Bundesliga players and found that while there was a minimal difference, after the initial quarantining period, in the number of games players were able to take part in pre- and post-infection, there was a small but noticeable decrease in the number of minutes they were able to log. This was accompanied by a more than 5% decrease in player’s performance in metrics such as passes completed and, in contrast to the effects of influenza, these phenomena “remain persistent for far more than six months”. The study also found that widespread outbreaks amongst teams led to a “negative effect that is likely larger than the sum of individual effects”. “We have historical data on player’s responses to different exercises that we do,” said Knight. “We’re able to compare that data pre- and post-Covid. With the effects of long Covid, there hasn’t been too much research on it for sportspeople. “For us, it’s a case of looking at everything and keeping a keen eye out. You get to know your athletes and how they respond to training or what they’re capable of. It’s about being vigilant and making sure that we don’t miss any warning signs that could potentially pop up.”",Sport/Football,A-Leagues fixture pile-up will clear but concern rises over Covid’s long-term impact | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/a-leagues-fixture-pile-up-will-clear-but-concern-rises-over-covids-long-term-impact
1/10/2022,"The New South Wales and Tasmanian state Liberal governments have expressed concern the federal religious discrimination bill will override their anti-discrimination laws. Central provisions of the Morrison government bill, including those protecting statements of belief and religious institutions’ hiring practices, would override state laws potentially making claims unworkable, they submitted to a parliamentary inquiry.  The Coalition is struggling to win support for the proposed legislation, with a trio of moderate Liberal MPs reserving their right to vote against it and a deal between the attorney general and another group of disaffected MPs breaking down after a religious backlash. The bill is being considered by two parliamentary inquiries, including the joint committee on human rights. The Tasmanian attorney general, Elise Archer, submitted the federal bill appeared “to effectively invalidate the operation of the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act”, including the provision banning speech that offends, insults or humiliates a person based on a protected attribute. Archer submitted a person need only claim that their statement was a protected statement of belief and the Tasmanian anti-discrimination tribunal “must decline to hear the matter” unless the claim was specious. While the person who made the statement was not required to show it was a statement of belief, the complainant would be required to prove it breached the bill’s safeguards that such statements must not be malicious, intimidating or harassing, she said. “I would like to reiterate that the Tasmanian government’s view is [the package] would diminish the ability of the Tasmanian anti-discrimination tribunal to deal with certain complaints and … we continue to strongly advocate for no weakening of our anti-discrimination laws.” The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has openly questioned the need for the federal bill. Anti-Discrimination NSW, the state government body that administers discrimination law, submitted it “remains concerned” the bill does not strike the right balance between freedom of religion and other rights. It warned the religious discrimination bill would override provisions in state law “that limit the circumstances under which faith-based schools can discriminate against job applicants and existing employees”. The statement of belief and hiring clauses “would also create significant procedural and access to justice issues”, it said, because the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal may not have jurisdiction to consider state claims where the federal law is invoked as a defence. Moving the matter to a federal court would add “procedural and financial burdens on complainants and create a barrier to access to justice”. Professor of constitutional law Anne Twomey submitted the federal government had attempted a “provocative” takeover of state law, but the drafting was “conceptually confused and probably invalid”. Both sections “seek to control the operation of a state law”, she argued, rather than merely creating an inconsistency with state law. “How can a commonwealth law dictate the interpretation of what amounts to discrimination under a state law? “It cannot do so. It cannot amend or alter a state law or instruct a court as to how to interpret the state law.” The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference praised the bill, arguing that it “does not go far enough” to ensure that freedom of religion is protected. The conference accused state governments including Victoria of seeking to constrain religious institutions’ hiring and firing powers. The Australian Human Rights Commission submitted that it “strongly supports the introduction of enforceable protections against religious discrimination for all people in Australia”. But while it endorsed those elements of the bill, it warned other sections “would provide protection to religious belief or activity at the expense of other rights”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning These were “unnecessary and disproportionate, or are otherwise inconsistent with international human rights law” and should be removed, it said. In addition to the statements of belief clause, the AHRC complained the bill “provides very broad exemptions that allow ‘religious bodies’ to engage in religious discrimination” and allows corporations to make a complaint of religious discrimination. “This is a significant departure from domestic and international human rights laws which protect only the rights of individuals, that is, humans.”",News/World news,‘No weakening’: Liberal state governments voice concern over federal religious discrimination bill ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/no-weakening-liberal-state-governments-voice-concern-over-federal-religious-discrimination-bill
1/10/2022,"Heart disease, an umbrella term for conditions that impair blood flow including stroke and vascular disease, affects about 1.2 million Australians and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Lifestyle factors, including exercise, are important for heart disease prevention and are vital for recovery.  While exercise can be daunting for fear of injury, experiencing symptoms or having a heart attack, Dr Angela Spence from Curtin University says it can be done safely. Getting it right could even be a life saver. “When prescribed well, the benefits of exercise for people with heart disease can be extensive and include improved quality of life, physical performance [and] reduced risk of having another event and developing additional conditions,” she says. During a heart attack, heart rate and blood pressure go up, explains accredited exercise physiologist Bridget Nash. Heart rate and blood pressure also go up when exercising, so this will improve the body’s ability to handle that stress. But when being active it’s important to focus on intensity, Nash adds, as medications tend to interfere with heart rate and blood pressure response. Before undertaking any exercise regimen or activity, consult your doctor or physician. To strengthen the heart’s ability to handle high blood pressure and heart rate, Nash recommends high-intensity interval training. “But when I say high-intensity interval training, I don’t mean anyone with a heart condition should be signing up for the nearest F45 class,” she hastens to add. Completing a 10-second effort at a perceived exertion level of six to seven out of 10, followed by 50 seconds of complete rest and repeating a couple of times, will hit the mark while allowing the body to recover quickly. The easiest way to do this is on a bike, Nash says. If doing longer spurts of activity, Spence recommends a lower intensity level that feels light to moderate – around two to four out of 10. Cardio-based activity helps improve blood flow around the heart, she says but strength training is also important, as it can build muscle as well as improving self-confidence to perform activities of daily living. Nash agrees, saying: “The importance of exercise is to increase the efficiency of the muscles to de-load the heart. A strong muscle is an efficient muscle.” Get out your dancing shoes! Nash is a big fan of dance for a social class activity. Not only can dancing be fun, but it can be a safer option without the one-on-one attention you might have with an exercise physiologist. “A dance class, ballroom, jive or tap gets the heart rate up a little, but not an awful lot,” she says. “And it’s a great way to build some strength along the way.” Water aerobics is also a good option, says Spence. She describes a recent study in which people with stable heart disease who took part in a 12-week water-based circuit exercise program (three 60-minute sessions a week) improved their fitness and leg strength while also reducing body fat – a key risk factor for heart disease. The world’s your oyster when it comes to opportunities for free exercise, just by increasing incidental activity. “Reducing sedentary behaviours can be a great way of incorporating more activity into your day,” says Spence, “simply by modifying your habits.” To achieve current recommendations for exercise in people with heart disease – 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity on most, if not all, days of the week – try breaking up time sitting down, listening to podcasts or audiobooks while walking, cleaning or gardening. Use active modes of transport like getting off the bus one stop earlier or parking the car further away from the shops. Indeed, “walking will always be one of the easiest, most available and most affordable heart-healthy exercises”, Nash says. It could be risky exercising at a prolonged intensity rating of eight out of 10 without rest, Nash warns. She suggests not starting any new exercise without expert supervision and an individually tailored program, particularly if you have resting blood pressure of 180/100 or higher. Heart Research Australia recommends consulting a health professional if exercise feels uncomfortable or painful. Are there any exercises to avoid? “Avoid being inactive,” says Spence.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with heart conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/10/how-to-move-with-heart-conditions
1/10/2022,"In the midst of legal challenges in tennis and inglorious scandals plaguing cricket, the AFLW’s return this weekend came as a welcome relief. Entering its sixth season, the league kicked off on Friday night with a thumping win by expansion team, Richmond, over fellow newcomers, St Kilda. While both teams entered the system in season four, the score could not have been more different, with the Tigers managing an almost perfect 10 goals one (61) to the Saints’ 3.5 (23). Ironically, it was the previously underperforming Tigers who provided one of the most impressive passages of play ever witnessed in women’s football. Setting aside inevitable first game wobbles and some uneven score lines, the main takeout from the opening round was the dramatic improvement across all aspects of the game. This was despite Covid-19 delaying the start of the season, forcing last minute fixture changes and depriving the crowds of seeing W Award winner, Emma Kearney, line up for North, after she tested positive to Covid earlier in the week.  While Covid and injuries are a risk for all athletes, AFLW players’ six-month season and part-time wage offset by year-round fitness and conditioning means most AFLW players also have full time jobs, family or educational commitments. The challenge of “living with Covid” in the face of multiple responsibilities and activities increases significantly. Yet astonishingly, despite all of this, the standard of the competition continues to take great leaps, year after year. Some of the improvement comes down to experience – players have simply had more time in the AFL system. Foundation players have now notched up five campaigns, and as seasons have been extended to 10 home and away games plus three finals matches, this means significantly more playing time. Clubs have reviewed and improved their women’s football departments, staffing and resources, fitness programs and player support every year. This means players have more targeted and consistent preparation. The “cross-code experiment” has also changed emphasis, with cross-code players either committing entirely to football, or dropping out of the AFLW system. The Tigers’ Mon Conti’s outstanding display on Friday night (29 disposals, nine clearances and seven tackles) is testament to what she’s capable of after completing the first full pre-season of her AFLW career since putting her basketball career on hold. Uninterrupted pathways have also helped the rising standard of play. Since the inception of the AFLW the AFL and state competitions have established pathways for girls and young women into elite AFL football with the introduction of national and youth academies. Prior to 2017, there was no established youth pathway through teenage years, and most of the senior players who have dominated the competition were forced out of football for extended periods, often to join other sports, or leaving sport altogether, due to a lack of youth competitions for girls beyond 14 or 15 years old. Most notably, two-time W Award winner, Erin Phillips turned to basketball when she was no longer allowed to play AFL foootball, forging a career in the WNBL and playing for the Opals at the Olympics. It took her out of footy for 19 years before her triumphant return to her first sport. The introduction of new rules have also had an impact on the game. Despite generations of women’s football development at their disposal, clubs attempted to simply overlay coaching strategies from the men’s game when setting up AFLW programs. At the same time, the AFL made significant changes to the rules, introducing a smaller ball, and fielding only 16 players a side. “It’s problematic when you remove two players from the traditional field when they don’t have a full-time endurance engine to make up for it,” said Julia Chiera, Darebin Falcons VFLW assistant coach, former teammate and coach to many of the game’s biggest stars. “Part-time players’ skills, fitness and playing experience were just not ready-made in 2017 for that vision.” This is less of a problem in 2022. Additional rule changes to the boundary throw in, this year’s stand rule, and the goal square kick in have also had a positive impact. Another development, according to Chiera, is that “male coaches have finally adjusted the game style to suit the women’s game, and women players’ strengths”. This has been a common complaint among women’s football experts, beyond the issue of fairness, about the limitations and frustrations of seeing new or untried male coaches cross over from the men’s game without the depth of experience or a solid understanding of the specifics of the women’s game. Whether in acknowledgement of issues of equity or the need for relevant experience, there has been a noted increase in female assistant coaches drawn from women’s football. And it shows. In round one, multiple players racked up north of 30 possessions and there was an early goal of the year contender from Fremantle’s Ebony Antonio. Whatever further challenges 2022 throws at the AFLW this season, players and clubs have already demonstrated their commitment to digging deeper and playing harder and smarter with every new game.",Sport/Sport,AFLW back up and running with distinctly higher quality of play on show | Nicole Hayes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/aflw-returns-with-distinctly-higher-quality-of-play-on-show
1/10/2022,"The departure from the women and equalities committee of a Tory MP who faced accusations of sexism has been welcomed by some of its members. The Ashfield MP Lee Anderson, who boycotted watching England’s men in the European Championship over players taking the knee, was criticised for telling a female district councillor in his constituency to “stay out of big boy politics” in November. Samantha Deakin said she was a victim of “blatant misogyny and sexism”.  Anderson was appointed to the committee in May last year but stood down after six months, and was replaced in mid-December by the former equalities minister Caroline Dinenage. Anderson faced an internal party complaint for posting a sexist comment on Facebook in 2018, with the party asked to examine a post by Anderson in July 2018. It showed a photo of Anderson looking at the chest of a female canvasser in a vest top. He captioned the photo: “Out with some great knockers tonight in Skegby.” Anna Soubry, who was then the Conservative MP in the neighbouring constituency of Broxtowe, was made aware of the post and complained to the then party chairman, Brandon Lewis, and other senior officials. “Lee is an odious sexist,” said Soubry at the time. Anderson said he had left the committee “due to the time commitment required”, adding: “The meetings are always on a Wednesday, which is my busiest day. I felt I could not give the role the time and effort it deserved.” But other members of the committee said Anderson had not attended the majority of meetings during his time on the committee. Alex Davies-Jones, who is herself leaving the committee because she has been appointed to the shadow frontbench, said it wasn’t “going to be a big loss to the committee”. She said that when Anderson took up the position on the committee there was consternation among other members who feared he would be counterproductive to its work, but Davies-Jones said it “was a shame” he had not heard more from a wide range of evidence from people facing discrimination, including those with protected characteristics. “It would have made really good viewing to see him confronted by data, facts and experts in the field would have given him a greater understanding of the arguments put forward and maybe dispelled some myths.” Another member of the committee said: “He clearly put himself forward to disrupt the committee, but he failed entirely and has been replaced by a former minister who will be diligent. His departure will not be missed.”  This article was amended on 9 January 2022 to clarify a quote.
