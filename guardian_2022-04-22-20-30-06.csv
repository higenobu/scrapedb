4/22/2022,"A little more than a decade ago, the decline of the British record shop looked terminal. But, in a dramatic turnaround, numbers doubled in the first half of the 2010s, and even now, after Covid lockdowns, they are at levels not seen since the 1990s: 407 independent stores were counted in 2021. Since it came to the UK in 2008, Record Store Day – celebrated this weekend – has gone from having the sense of a charity appeal for the afflicted, to one of the biggest music industry beanfeasts in the calendar. But behind the vinyl hype, things remain precarious, and a record shop now is rarely just a record shop. It’s commonplace for them to also be cafes or bars. But how about one with a built-in radio station (Some Great Reward in Glasgow or the Book and Record Bar in West Norwood)? Or with a bakery renowned for its pie and mash (Coffee and Vinyl in Torquay), an entire charcuterie counter (Bradford’s Record Café – whose blunt Yorkshire slogan is “Vinyl, Ale, Ham”), or an organic brewery and record label all in a stable block (Futtle, on the outskirts of a Fife fishing village)? How about one that exists for only a day each month and is as much party as shop (the Re:Warm pop-up in a Bournemouth bike shop-cafe), or one which is also the owner’s home (The Record Deck): a barge, setting up stall wherever it finds itself on the canal system? The ways in which the shops are founded and run are just as various: quitting a successful 25-year tech career to start a shop with a membership scheme in a sleepy New Forest tourist town (Black Star in Lyndhurst), or setting up an employee cooperative to save an almost 60-year-old establishment (David’s Music in Letchworth). What unites them is very hard work. Fresh out of prison with £150 to his name, DJ Antony Daly joined a community interest company (CIC) (one whose profits are reinvested into the company to benefit local society). Daly has a location of his own now for his shop 586 Records in a former Auto Trader office in Gateshead, and a thriving mail-order business: he’s in the platinum club of the top 100 merchants on Discogs. But when he started seven years ago, it was only the CIC getting him on his feet, giving him a small space in an old office block in central Newcastle without requiring a long tenancy. He recalls “being in the premises six to seven days a week, never less than 12 hours, plus DJing Friday and Saturday nights until the early hours – all while struggling to get a passport which I needed to apply for funding, and unable to get on the council housing list due to my … previous tenancy.” Fran Jones of Black Star – who ditched “a great career” in the first Covid lockdown to pursue his passion project – is privileged compared with Daly. But he too reports working 12-16- hour days. “Most people thought I was crazy to leave a very well compensated role for the shop life and the music industry – and most still do. It’s not easy starting a new business at the best of times, but during a global pandemic … wow.” The staff of David’s Music also committed to their current form during the first lockdown, although, as Ashlie Green says, hardly by choice and “in all honesty, fairly naively”. David’s was a bookshop that had sold music since the mid-1960s with a standalone record department from the early 80s – but when its owners sold up, the staff had to decide very quickly to club together as an Employee Ownership Trust (like the home-audio company Richer Sounds). “There was a fair bit of panic to begin with,” says Green. “This was March 2020 and the shop closed for lockdown just days before we signed the papers to be an EOT.” But in some ways lockdown was a blessing, she adds. “It gave me time to learn how to build an e-commerce site myself and learn how it worked properly.” Just as Antony Daly had to integrate his initial store with his Discogs selling, David’s Music was dragged into the 21st century, and most shops now are an online-offline hybrid to some degree. Michael Johnson of West Norwood Book and Record Bar says the one thing he wishes he’d known when he started in 2013 was to defy “those thieving bastards Amazon” and put all his stock online to combat their dominance of the physical-music market. Again, though, necessity was the mother of invention. “The vinyl revival was tentative when we opened,” says Johnson. “So we needed other sales avenues to support it.” In his case, that meant a licensed bar and wheeled record shelves that could be pushed aside to make an events space – then later, pushed by local DJs Alex Paterson of the Orb and Kev “DJ Food” Foakes, creating an online radio station, wnbc.london, streaming live from the shop. This kind of enterprise keeps shops in the public eye, but also connects musicians and local communities. Antony Daly says having in-store sets brings younger DJs into a shop for the first time and “watching a vinyl DJ has then opened them up to the idea of buying records and learning to play from turntables”. Fran Jones has pledged that when Black Star’s membership scheme reaches 1,000 subscribers (they’ve got 650 in their first year), it will turn into a programme to fund demo recording or vinyl pressing for local musicians. Sometimes the social and community aspects are the first consideration. Talking to Stephen Marshall about Futtle, which he runs with his partner Lucy Hine, it’s obvious they’re not about hustle, but a quality of life that’s as slow as the cask conditioning of their organic ales. They sell mainly collectible old records and only select new material “either from folk that we know or bands that drop by to play, or things we really want to stock”. They only open at weekends, don’t sell online, and look askance at Record Store Day. “We don’t stock major-label, 10,000-copy limited reissues on coloured vinyl,” Marshall says. “We actually had to stop running our own record label because of RSD clogging up pressing plants.” Taking it even further is the Record Deck’s Luke Gifford. His entire life is afloat with his record collection connecting to “a constant stream of music and music fans to chat to”, inspired less by anything on the high street than by a community of literal fellow travellers: “a herbalist, bookshops, crafters, artists, floating village halls, a curry boat, pizza boat, a potter, hat maker and blacksmith” roving the UK’s canals. Gifford’s might not be a replicable business, let alone scalable – but it is emblematic of the sense of mission it takes to run a record shop in 2022. Shops may be ultra-specialist and refuse the commercial pressures of Record Store Day like Futtle, cater to a broad audience and embrace it warmly like David’s or Black Star, or remain ambivalent: West Norwood’s Johnson mutters about “major labels milking” RSD with special edition prices but ultimately accepts that “about a month’s turnover in a day cannot be sniffed at”. But what links them all – in taking risks, investing savings, navigating post-Brexit import and export taxes, working those 12-hour days – is a total obsession with music needing a physical place in the world to connect around. And it brings rewards. “In a year,” says Black Star’s Fran Jones, “I have made hundreds of friends and am linked by thousands of records sold in person to thousands of real musical experiences. And I genuinely feel that and it feeds what I do – every single day.”  Record Store Day is on 23 April.",Arts/Music,"Canals, charcuterie and beer: how record shops are staying afloat",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/canals-charcuterie-and-beer-how-record-shops-are-staying-afloat
4/22/2022,"Newcastle may not be mathematically safe but the bookies have them at 500-1 to go down so their recent purple patch has sealed the deal on another season in the top flight. Eddie Howe will be targeting a top four finish and what better side to notch up a fourth successive win against than Norwich. Dean Smith’s side showed tremendous fight in defeat against Manchester United last time out but arguably Newcastle will pose a much more difficult proposition. They are a team in sync compared to one carried solely on Cristiano Ronaldo’s shoulders. Norwich can almost count on Everton losing so a win would close the gap to six points from safety with five games to play. Anything other than this scenario and hope will surely be snuffed out.

4/22/2022,"The leaders of Germany, Spain and Portugal have publicly backed Emmanuel Macron in Sunday’s French presidential election runoff, calling on French voters to support “freedom, democracy and a stronger Europe” – and taking a swipe at Brexit. In a highly unusual intervention in another country’s election, Olaf Scholz, Pedro Sánchez and António Costa said in an op-ed column in the leading French daily Le Monde that France’s second-round vote was “for us, not an election like any other”. Although they did not mention Macron or his far-right rival Marine Le Pen by name, the centre-left German chancellor and Spanish and Portuguese prime ministers said they “hoped” the incumbent’s vision of “France, Europe and the world” would win. The vote was a choice between “a democratic candidate who believes France is stronger in a powerful and autonomous EU, and an extreme-right candidate who openly sides with those attacking our liberty and our democracy,” they said. The EU needed a France that remained “at the heart of the European project”, they said, continuing to “defend our common values” in a “strong and generous Europe”. “We hope the citizens of the French Republic will choose it.” A longstanding Eurosceptic, Le Pen, who, polls suggest, is trailing Macron two days before the deciding vote, has dropped her pledge in previous elections to abandon the euro and leave the EU. But much of her current platform would imply breaking EU and single market rules, experts say, leading to a “Frexit in all but name”. In a dig at Britain’s decision to leave the bloc, the three leaders said “Take back control” had been “the Brexiteers’ promise”, but that Brexit had instead “disrupted Britain’s transport and supply chains, caused a collapse in its foreign trade and seen inflation rates generally higher than in the eurozone.” Those in the UK who were supposed to be “the first beneficiaries of leaving the EU – workers, young people and the vulnerable – are those who have ultimately suffered the most,” they wrote. The leaders said the election outcome was crucial “for France and for all of us in Europe” because of Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Populists and the far right in all our countries have made Vladimir Putin an ideological and political model,” they wrote, referring to past admiring remarks by Le Pen about the Russian president. A spokesperson for Le Pen’s Rassemblement National (National Rally) said that outside interventions in elections were rarely welcomed by voters or effective, adding that there were other EU governments that shared her vision for an “alliance of sovereign nations”. An emotional appeal by Barack Obama to British voters not to back Brexit was widely criticised by Leave campaigners, with some suggesting the then US president’s remarks may have actually helped their cause.",News/World news,"Leaders of Germany, Spain and Portugal urge French to vote Macron",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/france-election-vote-macron-leaders-germany-spain-portugal-le-pen
4/22/2022,"The biggest compliment you can currently pay Leicester is that they are playing like an international team. Steve Borthwick has worked for long enough at the right hand of Eddie Jones in Japan and England to know the importance of being tough to play against as well as supremely fit. He has also gathered some shrewd tactical lieutenants around him and the uplift in Tigers’ efficiency has been conspicuous. Even their rivals acknowledge there has been no disputing the best side in the country from September to April. “What they’ve done is go back to their roots,” says the Harlequins’ coach, Tabai Matson. “They are formidable around the set piece – the best in the league – [they] are ferocious defensively and work so hard for each other. “Underpinning their success is the fact they’re leading the competition in those areas. George Ford is leading them well, the captain [Ellis Genge] is in the engine room and he’s playing well. A lot of things are back that have been their trademarks for decades. They’re clearly well-drilled with Borthers there and they’re setting the standard.” The only question marks are the normal ones associated with longtime frontrunners: can they find another gear in the closing stages? This weekend’s trip to Harlequins will be instructive: if the champions can be ground down on their own patch, Tigers fans will see no reason why they cannot return to Twickenham’s biggest stage and beat anyone in June. Falter at home to Leinster in the European quarters, though, and a little self-doubt could resurface. It has been a long road back to the playoffs for Saracens, who were last involved in a Premiership final three years ago. There have been flashes of their old dominant selves but, by their own admission, they have not been firing consistently. Less experience in certain positions? Overeagerness? According to Ben Earl, the league’s top tackler, a much more upbeat narrative may yet unfold. “If you look at Quins’ template last year momentum was crucial for them. That’s something we’ve been speaking about … not so much the tangible five points every week but the feeling we’re getting on the pitch. We’ve had a couple of crucial people injured but we’re slowing getting back to a full complement and we’re excited about what that could mean.” Having lost at Sandy Park this season, though, there is recognition that this weekend will be tough. “Exeter is a massive rivalry. There’s obviously been a bit of bite between the two teams over the years … we know that if we’re slightly off it we’re going to get punished.” The chance to knock the Chiefs out of the title running would be a further bonus. “It’s an elephant in the room in terms of what they need out of the game but we also know we have Quins breathing down our necks,” says Earl. “If we take our foot off the pedal we’re probably going to pay the price for it. It’s as big a game for us as it is for them in terms of belief.” At their best no one has a sharper attacking edge than Quins. They are the Premiership’s top try-scorers with 78 but they give the opposition a chance, too. Saracens, their likely playoff opponents, have completed a home and away double against their London adversaries this season and Leicester have also beaten them. The good news from Matson’s perspective is that the club’s narrow two-leg European exit to Montpellier has hardened his players’ resolve. “If we don’t get this right, Leicester will humiliate us,” warned the coach. “You can’t sulk for too long. This week’s really important for measuring ourselves. The two teams in front of us in the league are setting the standard. They’ve set the benchmark and we need to lift.” Quins are not about to retreat into their shells but against Montpellier their decision-making was not as consistently sure-footed as it might have been. “The lessons we learned from that defeat, we have to right if we are to be serious contenders,” continued Matson. “The way we play it’s always going to be a balancing act. We want to play to our DNA but you have to be very pragmatic against the best teams in Europe.” As they showed last season, though, a dramatic late comeback can never be discounted and, as Matson stresses, it is what happens next that really matters: “We have still got another nine weeks of the competition left and they are the most important.” Exeter’s normally assured place in the playoffs is currently far from guaranteed. Gloucester’s five-point haul after their cancelled fixture with Worcester had propelled them into fifth before their visit to Bristol on Friday night and Northampton are also in the frame. Much will hinge on Gloucester’s final two regular season games against Harlequins (away) and Saracens (home); both opponents are likely to be pushing for a home semi-final and at least one of them will have to be beaten. The Cherry & Whites have been building nicely under George Skivington but this season they have lost home and away to Exeter and the European Challenge Cup remains another distraction. The Saints, meanwhile, have Dan Biggar and Courtney Lawes sidelined and may have left themselves with too much to do. Which brings us back to the Chiefs, Premiership finalists for the past six consecutive seasons and twice winners. Injuries have weakened them at key moments, untimely red cards at Harlequins and Worcester also proved costly, and losses at home to Northampton, Newcastle and Wasps by a combined aggregate of four points have not helped either. All that said, their destiny remains largely in their own hands and they should still make the playoffs if they can win at Saracens this weekend. “We cannot talk about what happened earlier in the season and be hard on ourselves, we just have to win every game,” stressed their experienced Irish centre Ian Whitten. “We have to beat Sarries, we cannot afford to drop any more points.”",Sport/Sport,Who holds the aces as the race for the Premiership title hots up? | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/race-for-the-premiership-title-hots-up-rugby-union
4/22/2022,"Portrait of an Unknown Lady by María Gainza, translated by Thomas Bunstead (Harvill Secker, £14.99)Insincerity, said Oscar Wilde, “is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities”. It’s a principle that María Gainza applies with brio to her dazzling novel about art and authenticity, seeing and not seeing, evocatively titled La Luz Negra (The Black Light) in its original Spanish. There are plenty of unknown ladies in the book. Our narrator is unpicking the life of her late employer Enriqueta, “the single, despotic authority on the price and authenticity of all paintings”, who turns out to have been providing fake authentication for forgeries, particularly of works by the real-life artist Mariette Lydis. An assemblage of literary quotations, court papers, auction catalogues and the “fairground kaleidoscope” of memory, the novel packs a huge amount into its 208 pages. If the reader is never quite sure what’s fact and what’s fiction, that’s just part of the fun. The Trouble With Happiness and Other Stories by Tove Ditlevsen, translated by Michael Favala Goldman (Penguin Classics, £10.99)This compilation of two volumes of very short stories from the 1950s and 60s – most are under 10 pages – provides an intense reading experience. They feature people numb to life’s commonplace pleasures: mostly women, occasionally children. “Hanne was only seven, but already possessed a great deal of formless anxiety.” The astringent prose sets itself against sentimentality: one woman, disabled from childhood paralysis, loves that her husband offers “none of that horribly considerate sympathy”. So clear is Ditlevsen’s eye that it’s impossible to tear yourself away from the fates of her characters, however grim. And there is black comedy too: in the title story, which reads like preparatory work for Ditlevsen’s exceptional trilogy of memoirs (Childhood, Youth, Dependency), the teenage narrator goes to visit her estranged brother, explaining to the landlord that she is his sister. “They all say that,” comes the reply. The Land of Short Sentences by Stine Pilgaard, translated by Hunter Simpson (World, £13.99)In this charming and funny novel, a woman tries to settle into a remote Danish community with her boyfriend and baby son. She struggles to make small talk with locals (hence the title), tries very hard to learn to drive and resents the way parenthood has reduced her vocabulary to “compound words”: “wet wipes, high chair, sippy cup”. Her job as a newspaper advice columnist reveals that others aren’t any better at navigating social interactions: one correspondent wants to talk to her parents about philosophy but finds that “they try to turn the conversation back to wind energy as quickly as possible”. “Everyone you meet is on the way somewhere,” a friend advises, and the buzz of people coming and going through the pages, and the warmth and wit of the narrator’s voice, make it a pleasure to be in her company. The Old Woman With the Knife by Gu Byeong-Mo, translated by Chi-Young Kim (Canongate, £14.99)“Hornclaw” is a 65-year-old hitwoman in Seoul whose blade skills and “killer body” (pun intended) make her an unconquerable asset in the busy contract killing industry. It’s a world that works by evasion: real names are concealed; the job is referred to as “disease control”; and nobody thinks too hard about the victims. (Hornclaw cries only when her hips ache.) But victims sometimes bite back. As Hornclaw begins to worry she’s losing her mojo after a target almost gets the better of her, she’s about to discover that a bereaved son has, for decades, been drawing his own plans against her. Gu gives her story plenty of energy, whether writing about Korean society or the politics of the workplace, and depicts burning flesh, garroting and exploded limbs with insouciance: it’s all in the spirit of an enjoyable romp that doesn’t try to dig too deep.",Arts/Books,The best recent translated fiction – review roundup,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/22/the-best-recent-translated-fiction-review-roundup
4/22/2022,"Lotte Wubben-Moy is not a stereotypical English centre-back. “I’ve always been competing, I’ve always been competitive,” the Arsenal player says, sounding so far, so normal. “But, then again, I’ve always had parts of me that enjoy illustration, enjoy art, enjoy things off the pitch that I hold quite dear to my heart. Things that make me me.” Football is everything and nothing to Wubben-Moy, so much a part of who she is but not the only part of her. “It’s something that has been really close to my heart throughout my whole life,” she says. “I went to sixth form in Stoke Newington and almost every single person in that school was an Arsenal supporter. Arsenal in the Community was active at that school. I remember cutting the ribbon for the pitch that was opened there. “So football has very much been intertwined with my life and intertwined with things off the pitch. But then the things off the pitch have also very much contributed to my successes and who I am on the pitch.” It is this view of football, of its holistic potential and power, that inspired the 23-year-old to come to the table for contract renewal talks with more than money, contract length and football in mind. Friday’s confirmation of an extension, the length undisclosed, came with a twist. “As part of her new deal,” an Arsenal announcement said, “Lotte has also committed to working closely with Arsenal in the Community over the coming years to give back to the local area where she grew up and still lives.” The England international, who has seven caps, is not just involving herself in existing community projects but has, with the club, drafted into her contract a 12-week programme that will run four times a year, inspired by her passions and aimed at women and girls in the communities she grew up in. “This is the next stage in my career and the contract is a reflection of that,” she says. “But beyond that, it is important to me as a person too because I exist in the same community as Arsenal. I come from north and east London and that’s very much where Arsenal is present – Hackney, Camden, Islington, these are the communities that the club serves. Within my contract I have excitingly built a programme inspired by my outlook on life, of appreciating the little things. Some of you may know that I write a blog [The Lotte Little Things] which is where I like to share my appreciation for those little things.” The programme is “built upon giving back to my community”, she says. “It will serve young girls and young women for the duration of my contract and I’ll be part of it – giving my time and energy to give back. I’ll be able to talk to them, to get involved. This is a side note on my contract which is extremely important to me. “I say this a lot, but football is a bridge over many waters. It helps give individuals options, give them possibilities, not necessarily reaching the highest professional level on the pitch but just on an enjoyment level. Football puts a smile on so many people’s faces and I think it can help you be your happiest self.” Wubben-Moy’s project will incorporate football, art, reading and the environment, she says. “It’ll be a 60/40 split for each session, which will be, hopefully, one and a half or two hours a week running for those 12 weeks. I haven’t confirmed my timings and the amount of time that I will be able to give to those sessions, but I hope to get to as many as possible. In those sessions 60% of the time will go to playing football and 40% of the time will be looking towards either art, reading or the environment, bringing in individuals externally who will be able to help with that. At the end of the 12 weeks, there’ll be an excursion, a trip out – I’m pushing for a trip to the Tate but I’m sure we’ll be doing various other trips as well.” That Wubben-Moy has been able to incorporate this project into her contract talks is testament to her ambitions for the game but also to her form. Having risen through Arsenal’s academy and into the senior side before playing college football with the North Carolina Tar Heels in the US, the defender is 18 months into a second spell at the club – making her second debut in September 2020. She is a core member of the team and her new contract comes not long after her fellow centre-back and Arsenal fan Leah Williamson signed a new deal. “The direction in which the club is going isn’t built upon sand, it’s built upon years of legacy,” says Wubben-Moy. “Like Leah, I know that legacy, I know we come from a heritage of winning, of competing, and that is what we will continue to do and what we will build upon. I’ve been watching Arsenal all my life but this seems like the next stage. It’s my job and I want to use my skill, my experience, to achieve on the highest levels, parallel with the club, and to continue to push the team on.”",Sport/Football,Lotte Wubben-Moy: the homegrown Arsenal gift who keeps on giving,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/lotte-wubben-moy-arsenal-new-contract-community-projects-football-art-environment
4/22/2022,"Until recently, Mildreds had a niche appeal: meat-free and going strong since 1988, but not exactly mainstream. Your average diner liked vegetables, sure, but preferred them with a lovely steak. Or even a not particularly lovely steak, such as the ones served at the Covent Garden Angus Steakhouse, where tourists flocked for the 12oz ribeye and the Carolina chunky chips smothered in cheese and crisp bacon. Or at least they did until it was closed and replaced by a new and very busy branch of Mildreds. Interestingly, the Burger King on nearby Leicester Square also turned vegan for a month this year, serving plant-based Whoppers to constant queues. Plants, it seems, are coming for us all, although anyone who has seen The Day of the Triffids would be under no illusions about any of this. Modern-day Mildreds is no longer the odd kid on the block. Once, it was a name to have up your sleeve for when weird Auntie June who didn’t shave her armpits came to town. Now, it is sleek and elegant; the new St Martin’s Lane branch even has a 10-person private dining room called Jane’s Place. Today’s clientele are everyday – mixed groups, birthday parties, etc – just as they are at the Pizza Express next door. My abiding memory of my Friday lunch was how they’re in dire need of more staff to deal with all the hopeful walk-ins gawping at the menu outside and blocking the doorway. The menu is delightfully bizarre in presentation, in a tiny font and all lower case, and featuring strings of words such as “mercimek kofte, pea & pomegranate freekeh, dill tahini” or “alma bowl, sweetcorn goji quinoa, rainbow ribbons, neep & beet pickle, leche de tigre shrub, almond queso fresco, avocado cream, omega seeds”; “edamame, szechuan passion, furikake” sits alongside “tempeh laab club cultured, prik nam pla dressing, leaves, herbs”. Mildreds’ menu is a list of geographically incongruent small and main plates influenced by the cuisines of India, Turkey, Korea, Thailand, South America, Los Angeles and beyond, with authentic-sounding names spliced with fake meats and terms for alternative proteins. Thus a rather straightforward, fake-chicken kebab, for example, is listed as “bhatti ka chick’n” – it was great, incidentally: smoky and well seasoned, served with a mango pickle yoghurt and a bowl of rich, sweet tomato chilli chutney. The soy chick’n that Mildreds uses is one I’ve seen in several good restaurants recently, has a disconcertingly real mouth-feel and soaks up the tastes of griddle pans, spices and sauces incredibly well. Lord knows where we’ll be with all this stuff in 10 years’ time – the leaps and bounds in the fake meat world are utterly amazing. “Katsu hot dog” was slightly less exciting, because the breadcrumbed faux frankfurter wasn’t quite warm, but it was saved by a pile of zingy pickled daikon that made me overlook the bowl of anonymous katsu curry sauce. A plate of gunpowder bonda – pea, spinach and potato fritters – lacked much evidence of heat, although more successful were the spinach gyoza that turned up with yet more daikon and a sharp orange lime ponzu. We ordered a “faux rerro cake” with chocolate sauce, hazelnut praline and “chantilly cream”, although we knew the latter wasn’t feasible, and the arrival of this chocolate cake was the point when Charles, who typically grizzles through all vegetarian restaurant visits but had been jovial up until this point, began to grumble. “It tastes of mushrooms,” he said. “OK, yes,” I agreed. “It’s a bit earthy, but it looks the part.” Mildreds’ “vegan” menu is almost unique in its utter lack of any mention of being vegan, vegetarian, anti-meat, pro-planet or whatever. There’s no chummy mission statement next to the starters about being kind to pigs or saving us from cow farts, no whimsical poetry on the pudding list, no lecture at the bottom of the bill and no invite by the coat stand to a vegan poetry slam evening. This is the first meat-free establishment I’ve eaten in that didn’t try to flog me a holistic birth doula service when I sat on the loo. Mildreds is unapologetic and utterly un-preachy, and there’s nothing more than a small “100% plant-based” mention on the menu. They’ve been doing what they do since 1988, and it has now become fashionable. Mildreds is not here to change your mind; if you don’t like it, hop off. They’re a bit long in the tooth for explanations and, besides, they’re far too busy, anyway. Mildreds 79 St Martin’s Lane, London WC2, 020-8066 8393.

4/22/2022,"When Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards ceremony last month Margo Jefferson had stepped away from her TV for a moment. Like millions of us, she watched it on replay, absorbing the sheer novelty of a normally stage-managed spectacle collapsing into chaos. Funnily enough, the incident crystallised several Jeffersonian themes: televised glamour, Black entertainers, and the question of how to behave in public. In her 2016 memoir Negroland, about the lifestyles and mores of the Black elite in mid-century America, Jefferson recalls her parents dissecting the TV performances of Sammy Davis Jr, Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne, and describes the oppressive power of the dictum “everything we do must reflect well on the race”. But times have moved on, she believes. Both Rock’s routine, in which he joked about Smith’s wife, Jada, and Smith’s response struck her as immature more than anything else. “They’re too old,” she sighs. “They are definitely too old and they should be too astute for these shenanigans.” Speaking to me from her apartment in New York’s West Village, in which the only physical objects appear to be books, she says: “That kind of old ‘respectability’ question did not really enter into it for me.” Why not? “Black culture, and our range of behavioural possibilities and choices, has expanded.” Judged as a performance, however – the critic in her is rarely stilled for long – it was simply cheap, juvenile, “staged hood theatrics”. “I wish it had been handled by Jada herself.” Black women’s self-determination – including her own – features heavily in Jefferson’s latest book, Constructing a Nervous System, which combines frank personal reflections with analyses of cultural icons including Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone and Josephine Baker. It is more formally experimental than Negroland, already a fairly experimental blend of memoir, social history and criticism. Jefferson frequently shows her working, breaking down a writerly equivalent of the fourth wall with interjections such as: “I’ve reached an emotional stalemate here. I want to dilute, possibly delete this … I feel a little ashamed.” Or: “As I write this I worry that I’m about to hurl raw intimacies at new, uncommitted readers. If I delay, though, I’m coddling myself.” Her easy geniality as we talk feels very different to the exacting, rather ruthless tone she takes with herself in print. What the two books share is a conviction that art is not “over there”, on the stage or gallery wall, but in our minds and our personal lives, shaping us intimately. Connecting with artists allows you to “move past your own little conventional self, giving you other physical and emotional possibilities,” she tells me. Fitzgerald in particular forced her to “question my own little protective devices and snobberies about what a pretty woman should be, what a glamorous woman should be, how useful and helpful feminine desirability was”. With Nina Simone, the resonances are darker. Jefferson talks about her “temperamental kinship” with the singer who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder late in her career. Is Jefferson bipolar too? “It was also a diagnosis I’ve received,” she tells me matter-of-factly, adding that she found out around a decade ago, although she has been in therapy for much longer than that (she is 74). “Not nearly as damaging, fortunately, to me, but that’s probably because they have medications, and there’s quite a range to bipolar.” She points out that “we were always calling Simone a strong, beautifully angry Black woman. But she was suffering too. And she was also angry that she was suffering and couldn’t assuage it.” These kinds of personal insights are harder to bring into the formal criticism Jefferson practised at the New York Times, where she reviewed books and plays, winning a Pulitzer prize in 1995. Is what she’s doing now a bit of reaction to those years of journalistic stricture? “Yeah, it does feel freer, more interesting. As a writer it allows me to try for more discoveries, in terms of tone, technique, or emotional temperature.” Though reading the book feels like hitching a ride on Jefferson’s own train of thought, the sense of structural looseness is deceptive. “It was very, very intensely, and sometimes frantically and frenetically planned. I kept switching things around. The transitions were the devil, and I can still critique some of them. But I knew it had to be carefully planned or it could be chaotic, in a way I could follow but a reader couldn’t.” What images, sounds and people are attracting her magpie mind right now? We talk about William and Kate in Jamaica – “The hands being shaken through the fence,” she cringes, referring to the photograph of the princess greeting Jamaicans through a barrier in Trench Town. “They’re clueless in their way … not ill-intentioned [but] clueless.” She mentions the new season of Donald Glover’s Atlanta. And vocalists – she lives for vocalists. “Cécile McLorin Salvant would not surprise people because I’ve written about her. But Megan Thee Stallion – I like to watch what she’s up to. I’m interested in that utterly shameless, what used to be called “vulgar bravado”, and sense of play, you know. She fulfils some of your expectations and desires and she thwarts others. I’m always interested in performers [who do] that.” What else? “TikToks! I have a friend who’s just very smart and funny, who is always sending me TikToks that are almost like really clever cartoonists, you know, daily strips.” TikTok, of course, is also a venue for projecting the self, for broadcasting the various identities we might be able to lay claim to, complete with hashtags and, occasionally, an enhanced sense of righteousness. What does she make of the current enthusiasm for self-labelling? “It simplifies. It can become a source of defensiveness and pride that you’re not in control of. In that way it can thwart a certain flexibility.” But, she adds, “I see its purposes” and warns the phrase “identity politics” is one that has become “like a truncheon”. “It was always delivered even on the page with a sneer, as if it was all about intellectual simple mindedness.” Why so? Because efforts to break down the old rules of race, class, gender and sexuality have in fact been quite successful. Things have opened up, been redefined, and “if you’re fighting those kinds of political and social and emotional changes, you have to demean and belittle and simplify your opponent and come up with a phrase that will signal to other people that it’s dangerous”. She sees the term “cancel culture” as similarly compromised. “You can critique a lot of particular choices without using that phrase,” she says. And critique them she does. For instance: “In the canon, I’m not so concerned with ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’, yanking out books that I don’t love. I don’t like bullying. And I don’t like the sense that we are so fragile, we’ve been treated so badly, we’ve been so oppressed that we cannot stomach any of this, that it can’t be anywhere around me. I don’t like that.” What’s next? Jefferson has just been named as a recipient of the Windham-Campbell prize, which comes with a $165,000 (£125,000) cheque. But she isn’t leaving herself much time to kick back and stream episodes of Atlanta. She’s already planning a “dual memoir” with a white American friend of her own generation, a “seasoned writer” whose name she’s keeping under wraps but says will be familiar. The plan is to chart decades of history from two distinct but intertwining perspectives. “We’ve gone through separately, and as close friends, so much wild and vehement social, emotional and racial change that we thought OK, let’s see. It will be about friendship too, from people for whom friendship has become as important as marriage.” And in the meantime, essays, interviews, appearances. Jefferson clearly takes her grandmother’s exhortation, also the last line of Constructing a Nervous System, to heart: “You haven’t earned your right to be tired yet, have you?”  Constructing a Nervous System by Margo Jefferson is published by Granta (£16.99).

4/22/2022,"A confession: I have watched a total of three episodes of Better Call Saul, a show that quite a few people reckon is not only the best on TV, but also better than its beloved predecessor Breaking Bad. I loved Breaking Bad and I know that, given time, I’d love Better Call Saul too. And yet, in 2015, after struggling through a trio of expertly made but often glacial instalments of Better Call Saul’s first series, I put it to one side, and seven years, three US presidents and one planet-altering pandemic (perfect timing for catching up on TV, you would have thought) later, I still haven’t picked it up again. Better Call Saul is not alone. I also abandoned Gomorrah, the Naples-set mafia drama, midway through its first season, turned off by how broadly drawn and basic it seemed compared with the Matteo Garrone film of the same name, also based on Roberto Saviano’s source material (plenty of Gomorrah fans have told me it gets much, much better in the following episodes and seasons). I limped through four episodes of Marvel’s loud, stern-faced, callback-heavy The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, after mistakenly thinking that, given I quite enjoyed Wandavision, I might like another Marvel show. Even shows that I like have suffered a similar same fate: for some unknown reason I stopped watching Derry Girls midway through series two, despite hugely enjoying every episode I had seen. Comedies, lacking the propulsive plottiness of dramas, are particularly at risk of being prematurely shelved – I’m still only halfway through series three of Stath Lets Flats, despite it being comfortably the funniest show on TV. And often one show will get bumped for another, more gripping one – when Severance arrived a few months back, its sheer addictiveness pushed several other shows I’d been watching to the sidelines, and I still haven’t returned to them. I’m sure I’m not alone in prematurely jettisoning series left and right. At a point when there’s more TV to watch than ever, and where that deluge of TV also has to vie with every other form of entertainment in existence, seeing a show through might not be the best use of one’s time. And certainly ditching a TV show halfway through a series doesn’t seem quite as dramatic an act as walking out of a movie early (more on that later) or, shame of all shames, giving up on a book. Still, it’s a big call to make – particularly if you’ve invested time and money into it. Plenty of great shows started slowly, after all – Parks and Rec and, yes, Breaking Bad all had patchy first series that bore little relation to the classics they would become. The Wire begins in such an impenetrable fashion – with its inscrutable police slang, enormous cast of characters and labyrinthine plot – that Charlie Brooker (an early superfan of the series) had to write a guide to watching it. I’m sure tons of people gave up on it after a single episode – and what a mistake that would have been. Some dumped Succession in its early episodes too, turned off by the Roy family and their parallels with real-life scumbag elites. I’m sure many of those people have since returned to the show, after hearing so much breathless praise for it in the seasons since. But in doing so they’ve missed out on much of the weekly reactions, predictions, memes, recaps and other things that make watching the show so enjoyable. They’ve probably had to sidestep a number of spoilers too – that’s the problem I’m currently facing with Better Call Saul. I do eventually plan on watching it, honest. I’ve just got a couple of other shows I should probably finish first … If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter please subscribe to receive The Guide in your inbox every Friday.",Arts/Culture,"The Guide #31: From Better Call Saul to Derry Girls, the TV shows we ditched",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/22/the-guide-better-call-saul-breaking-bad
4/22/2022,"Britain is to reopen its Kyiv embassy, Boris Johnson has announced, more than two months after moving it out of the Ukrainian capital before the Russian invasion. Since the embassy’s closure in February, the UK has retained a diplomatic presence in Ukraine, but has not been providing in-person consular assistance. The Foreign Office (FCDO) said at that time that the embassy was relocating temporarily and staff were operating from an embassy office in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. However, the embassy is expected to reopen next week after Russian forces were pushed back or withdrawn from the region around Kyiv in the face of Ukrainian resistance. A team of diplomats returning will include Melinda Simmons, the UK ambassador. The announcement, which the prime minister made at a press conference in India, also comes after he met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during an unannounced visit to Kyiv earlier this month. “The extraordinary fortitude and success of President Zelenskiy in resisting Russian forces in Kyiv means I can announce that very shortly, next week, we will reopen our embassy in Ukraine’s capital city,” Johnson said at the beginning of the press conference in New Delhi. “I want to pay tribute to those British diplomats who remained in the region throughout this period.” More than a dozen European countries, as well as the European Union, have already reopened their missions in Kyiv. They include Italy, Spain and France, which reopened on 16 April. The French ambassador, Etienne de Poncins, said: “It was obviously a very moving moment for me and my colleagues. We left Kyiv seven weeks ago.” He said they did not know whether they would ever return. The Czechs returned on 13 April, announcing on Twitter: “This is one of the many steps we are taking to show our support for Ukraine.” Zelenskiy has praised states whose missions have returned to the capital, saying they are sending “a clear signal to the aggressor”. The US has been weighing up the possibility of reopening its embassy in Kyiv.",News/World news,"Britain to reopen embassy in Kyiv, Boris Johnson announces",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/britain-to-reopen-embassy-in-kyiv-boris-johnson-announces
4/22/2022,"The artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), Gregory Doran, has announced he is stepping down from the role after 35 years with the company. He will remain as artistic director emeritus until the end of 2023 and will direct a production as part of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s first folio next year, his 50th production for the RSC. “It has been a real privilege to be a part of the amazing team leading this great company for this last decade of challenge and achievement,” Doran said of his decision. “We have made many strides in making our theatre more inclusive, accessible, diverse and accountable, but there is always more to do and I wish whoever succeeds me joy in continuing that work.” Doran was appointed artistic director in September 2012 and in his first production in the role he directed David Tennant in Richard II, which transferred to the Barbican theatre and was the first RSC production to be seen live in cinemas around the world. Shriti Vadera, the chair of the RSC, said: “Greg’s unparalleled knowledge of Shakespeare’s plays has created many memorable productions on our stages over a 35-year span that marks an extraordinary contribution to the RSC.” During his decade as artistic director, Doran has led the company in a number of landmark moments and through the challenges of the Covid pandemic. His 2018 production of Troilus and Cressida was the RSC’s first equally gender-balanced cast in a Shakespeare play on the main stage and featured the first disabled actor to play a leading Shakespeare role for the company, with the deaf actor Charlotte Arrowsmith as Cassandra. In 2016, he directed the Shakespeare Live! broadcast on the BBC to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death featuring a number of RSC alumni. Alongside Owen Horsley in June 2021, he directed a version of Henry VI Part 1, which invited audiences inside the full rehearsal process for the first time in the company’s history. Other productions include the world stage premiere of David Walliams’ The Boy in the Dress in 2019, Death of A Salesman with Harriet Walter and Antony Sher, and The Witch of Edmonton with Eileen Atkins in the title role.

4/22/2022,"A complaint of “inappropriate behaviour” has been made against the actor Bill Murray, leading to the production shutdown of the film he is working on, it has been reported. According to Deadline, production on the Searchlight film Being Mortal was halted on Monday and a letter was subsequently sent to cast and crew saying: “We were made aware of a complaint, and we immediately looked into it. After reviewing the circumstances, it has been decided that production cannot continue at this time.” The letter did not name Murray as the target of the complaint. However, Deadline named Murray and the New York Times followed, referencing an anonymous source saying that the movie was shut down because of what was described only as “inappropriate behaviour”. Being Mortal is an adaptation of Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, a nonfiction exploration of death and dying by surgeon Atul Gawande, and is written and directed by Aziz Ansari. Ansari also stars in the film alongside Murray and Seth Rogen. It is not known how long the shoot will be suspended. In their letter Searchlight say: “Our hope is to resume production and are working with Aziz [Ansari] and [producer] Youree [Henley] to figure out that timing.” Both Searchlight and a representative for Murray have been contacted for a response.

4/22/2022,"Dressed in billowing white, Mitski bows as Love Me More’s synths build and build. The screams that greet her are loud enough to set eardrums crackling: Mitskimania is here. Having pressed pause in 2019, stepping from the touring hamster wheel after three albums in four years, the Nashville-based songwriter became a superstar in absentia on TikTok – the New York Times recently reported that posts tagged #Mitski had crossed 1.5bn views. The song that sparked the craze, Nobody, is met by another sense-rearranging roar. But so is every other intro. The kids have devoured one of the most compelling, emotionally taxing catalogues in modern American music, and they’re happy to shout about it. There can be a darkness to the sort of fandom Mitski now commands, a sense of entitlement and a need for a piece of someone, and her stage presence continues to be heavily stylised in a manner that is artistically compelling but also protective. Its careful choreography and periods of darkness between songs draw attention to the show, not the performer. During First Love/Late Spring, Mitski mimes picking the peach of the lyrics, her movements studied by a couple of thousand sets of eyes. When she cuts loose – delivering surfy go-go moves to the garage-rock skronk of Townie, headbanging to the squalling Your Best American Girl – the effect is electrifying. These songs, which are rooted in the indie rock of Mitski’s earlier work, fare better than ornate, synth-driven moments from 2018’s Be the Cowboy and her new record Laurel Hell. This is a cavernous space and the mix is soupy, sucking the intricate lead line of Geyser and the spiralling keys of The Only Heartbreaker towards the former ​​Victorian warehouse’s vaulted ceiling. But, given the energy being transferred between musician and crowd, what should be a major gripe is quickly ushered away. Opening the show, Mitski sang of needing love to fill a void – it duly surges towards her tonight, like iron filings around a magnet, and still there remains a sense, for her and her fans, that there is room for more besides.  Mitski plays Leeds University, Friday, then tours the UK until 29 April.",Arts/Music,Mitski review – throwing shapes and cutting loose for pop’s most ardent fans,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/mitski-review-marble-factory-bristol
4/22/2022,"Manchester City’s parent company, the City Football Group, has failed in an attempt to add NAC Breda to its global portfolio after a furious backlash from fans of the Dutch club. CFG agreed a deal last month to buy NAC for €7m and make them the 11th club that its controls and the fifth in Europe – after City, Girona, Troyes and Lommel. The group signed a partnership agreement with NAC in 2016, allowing the Dutch club to take City players on loan and the sharing of scouting information, but the plan was to take the relationship further. But NAC’s supporters vowed to stand in the way because they did not want their club to lose its identity or become a factory for loan players. NAC’s 19,000-capacity stadium is normally packed and the club is very popular despite years of underachievement; they are eighth in the second division. A group of NAC fans arranged for a banner to be hung outside City’s Etihad Stadium on 27 March which read: “Stay out of our territory, NAC is not a City Group story.” There have also been banners inside the NAC stadium and chants against the proposed takeover – together with a campaign on social media. NAC have been owned by a group of shareholders since 2011 with four of them – under the umbrella of the NOAD Foundation – controlling a golden share, which can veto the sale of the club. There have been other would-be buyers for NAC, including a consortium from the United States, but NOAD has decided to transfer the shares to a group of local business people. A statement on the NAC website said: “After intensive discussions with both the City Football Group and two possible alternatives, the NOAD Foundation decided after careful and extensive testing to submit to the local plan of NAC Breda.”",Sport/Football,City Football Group plan to buy NAC Breda fails after supporter backlash,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/manchester-city-football-group-plan-to-buy-nac-breda-fails-after-supporter-backlash
