5/3/2022,"The sister of Lyra McKee has called the timing of a leaked letter, reportedly from Sinn Féin, to a group accused of having links to the dissident republican group allegedly behind the journalist’s murder, “exploitative of the tragedy for political purposes”. The two-year-old letter, from Sinn Féin’s Declan Kearney, reportedly referenced a potential “cooperation agreement” between Saoradh and Sinn Féin over achieving a border poll. It was an attempt to “work towards unity and changing the constitutional position, but only by consent, only by the public working together” according to Sinn Féin’s vice-president Michelle O’Neill, as she confirmed Kearney had written a letter to Saoradh. However, Nichola McKee-Corner, Lyra’s sister, called the leaking of the letter, at a divisive time for Sinn Féin’s electoral campaign, an exploitation of Lyra’s murder. In a statement, McKee-Corner questioned “the timing of the publication of this letter (given that it is over two years old) and the links made to my murdered sister”, and added that those responsible for leaking it “should hang their heads in shame for using my beloved sister in this way”. McKee-Corner said she was aware of Sinn Féin’s “efforts to encourage dissident republican groups, including Saoradh, to move away from violence and engage with the political process” since 2019, and that this “encouragement has been unsuccessful to date”. She went on to urge Saoradh and the other dissident groups to “accept that the war is over” and that “they need to relinquish violence once and for all”. McKee, a promising young journalist from Northern Ireland who wrote about the consequences of the Troubles, was 29 when she was murdered in Creggan, Derry in 2019, after she was hit by a bullet while she was reporting violent clashes between the New IRA and the police. Two men have since been charged with her murder. McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, also expressed scepticism about the timing of the release, saying that news of the letter did not surprise her and that she believed it was inevitable there would be attempts to try to bring Saoradh “into the fold to a degree”.“I’m not a Sinn Féin fan but that’s how things were done in the 1990s, and that’s how violence was brought to an end here, we brought the people into the political realm,” she told the BBC. The release of the letter comes at a time described by O’Neill as a “moment in history and a moment for real change” in an election video posted on Twitter. As polls are predicting Sinn Féin to secure a majority in the upcoming assembly elections, which would allow the party to nominate the first ever republican first minister in Northern Ireland.",News/News,Lyra McKee’s sister says Sinn Féin letter leak exploits her murder for politics,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/02/lyra-mckees-sister-says-sinn-fein-letter-leak-exploits-her-for-politics
5/3/2022,"Ronnie O’Sullivan is snooker’s world champion for a seventh time, as the greatest player in the sport’s history moved level with Stephen Hendry on the most Crucible titles won in the modern era after defeating Judd Trump in a thrilling final in Sheffield. O’Sullivan led 12-5 overnight in the meeting of the sport’s two most entertaining players, with many returning to Sheffield on Monday wondering when, not if, the 46-year-old would collect the six frames required to win the world crown for a seventh time. However, Trump won six of the eight frames in Monday’s afternoon session to reduce the gap to three and threaten one of the most remarkable comebacks in Crucible history. But O’Sullivan returned for the evening session in the form which has seen him saunter through to yet another final in Sheffield, and despite yet more valiant play from Trump, O’Sullivan ultimately ensured he would draw level with Hendry on seven world titles, the most of any player in the Crucible era, and all but remove any remaining doubt about his status as the greatest player ever to pick up a snooker cue. Breaks of 82, 88 and 75 in the first four frames of the evening session took him to the brink of the title and the £500,000 winner’s cheque, and while Trump responded after the mid-session interval with a century break to narrow the deficit, he still had to win the remaining five frames without reply to deny O’Sullivan snooker immortality. However, in the following frame, Trump left the door ajar for The Rocket and, in perhaps fitting fashion, he secured his seventh world crown with an exhilarating break of 85 to ensure he reigns supreme in the game once again, winning the biggest prize in the sport in a third different decade in the process.",Sport/Sport,Ronnie O’Sullivan beats Judd Trump for record-equalling seventh Crucible title,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/ronnie-osullivan-blunts-judd-trump-fightback-to-triumph-at-crucible
5/3/2022,"The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, says his plan to protect jobs and the economy during the pandemic has paid off, with the state budget flagging a return to surplus within four years. His eighth budget, to be handed down on Tuesday, will forecast a $7.9bn deficit in 2022/23, $3.3bn in 2023/24 and $1.1bn in 2024/25, before a predicted $650m surplus in 2025/26. An operating cash surplus of $1.3bn is also forecast in 2022/23, growing to $5.5bn in 2025/26. The 2022/23 deficit figure is $2.6bn higher than projected in the December budget update. However, the budget will show the state performed better than expected during the current financial year. This is despite the emergence of the Delta variant of Covid-19, which forced Melbourne and other parts of Victoria into lockdown. The state recorded a deficit of $17.6bn in 2021/22 – $1.9bn lower than forecast in the update – and operating cash deficit of $11.8bn. The government credits the result to short-term pandemic support initiatives. It expects expenditure will fall by almost 10% in the coming financial year as a result. “The forecasts in the budget reveal why Victorians can continue to be confident about the future,” Pallas said. “We’ve consolidated, we’re recovering strongly and the benefits are being shared across the state.” The state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, on Monday described the budget as a “pandemic repair plan”, suggesting billions will be spent on addressing issues in the health system, such as ambulance delays and overcrowded emergency departments. He said there would also be measures to encourage Victorians to see a GP for specialist referral sooner, ensuring fewer end up in the public hospitals. The state’s economy grew by 5.5% in 2021/22, which is double the 2.25% forecast in December’s budget update. The budget will show that the Victorian economy is expected to be 8.7% bigger at the end of 2021/22 than it was in 2018/19 – the last full financial year before the pandemic. The Department of Treasury and Finance forecasts Victoria’s economy will continue to grow by 3.25% next financial year, and then 2.25% in 2023/24, and 2.75% in each of the following two years. Employment growth is expected to reach 1.75% in next financial year and 1% in 2023/24, before rising to 1.75% in 2025/26. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Victoria’s unemployment stands at a record low of 4%, with the regional unemployment rate at 3.2% – almost a full percentage point lower than the national average of 4.2%. The participation rate is also close to record levels. The government says since September 2020 – the height of the pandemic economic shock – 280,000 extra Victorians have found work. The state’s infrastructure spend, forecast to average $21.3bn annually over the next four years, has also supported almost 200,000 jobs, it said. “The jobs story in Victoria is remarkable – it shows the plan to protect the community, the economy and workers has delivered,” Pallas said, referring to his four-step fiscal strategy first unveiled in the 2020 budget. The plan involves creating jobs, reducing unemployment and restoring economic growth, returning to a cash surplus, then to an operating surplus and finally to stabilise debt levels. He said the first three steps are on track, with initiatives to stabilise debt to be outlined in the budget. So far the government has announced a handful of measures in the budget, including $250m for a $250 payment for every household that seeks out a better power deal, $277.5m to combine the Victorian Certificate of Education and the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning from next year. A further $157.8m has been announced to upgrade train stations, bus stops, and tram stops across the state to make them more disability-friendly. The government will also spend $55.6m to implement the Crown royal commission recommendations and announced that from July 2023, the casino’s 2600 pokies machines will be subject to the same tax rates as those operated by not-for-profit, community-based venues such as RSLs. The move is expected to raise $30m in revenue each year.",News/Australia news,Victoria’s treasurer flags surplus in 2025/26 ahead of the state budget,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/victorias-treasurer-flags-surplus-in-202526-ahead-of-the-state-budget

5/3/2022,"The governing body of modern pentathlon has taken the “landmark decision” to replace equestrian with obstacle racing despite widespread opposition from athletes. The Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne said obstacle racing had been chosen from 60 potential options because it was “dynamic and attractive to global audiences”, and had “a simple and safe infrastructure for training”. Two variations of obstacle racing will now be tested – alongside fencing, swimming, running and shooting – before a final decision is taken by the UIPM’s congress. If approved, the new discipline will be added to the sport after the Paris 2024 Olympics. The UIPM said the decision, which was taken by a focus group of 26 athletes, was designed to ensure the future of a sport that has been a core part of the Olympic Games for more than 100 years. “After many months of detailed talks we are on the brink of a landmark decision that would change the history of modern pentathlon forever,” said Yasser Hefny, chairman of the UIPM athletes committee. “While we still have specifics to finalise, we have a new and exceptional opportunity to grow and give visibility to our sport for the benefit of many generations to come, and that’s very exciting.” A poll by Pentathlon United, an independent athlete representative body, found that over 95% of athletes were unhappy with the way the UIPM has conducted the change. On Sunday the Guardian revealed that several leading stars of the sport had written to the International Olympic Committee urging them to intervene. That looks unlikely with the IOC president, Thomas Bach, appearing to support the change after the distressing scenes at the Tokyo Olympics last year, when a horse was punched by a German coach for refusing to jump a fence. The former British modern pentathlete, Kate Allenby, who won bronze for Team GB at the Sydney Olympics, said athletes would continue to fight. “We’ve long suspected that the obstacle course was at the forefront of the UIPM executive board’s agenda in replacing riding,” she said. “The decision to only test OCR [obstacle course racing] and not any of the other apparent 60 options they considered just highlights this further. We repeat our call for the IOC to intervene.”",Sport/Sport,Modern pentathlon confirms obstacle racing will replace equestrian from 2024,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/modern-pentathlon-confirms-obstacle-racing-will-replace-equestrian-from-2024
