12/14/2021,"By Ben Blanchard TAIPEI (Reuters) - A full Chinese invasion of Taiwan with troops landed and ports and airports seized would be very difficult to achieve due to problems China would have in landing and supplying troops, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said in its latest threat assessment. Tensions between Taipei and Beijing, which claims the democratically-ruled island as its own territory, have risen in the past two years as China steps up military activities near Taiwan to pressure it to accept Chinese rule. In a report to lawmakers, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said China's transport capacity was at present limited, it would not be able to land all its forces in one go, and would have to rely on ""non-standard"" roll-on, roll-off ships that would need to use port facilities and transport aircraft that would need airports. ""However, the nation's military strongly defends ports and airports, and they will not be easy to occupy in a short time. Landing operations will face extremely high risks,"" the ministry said in its report, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters. China's logistics face challenges too, as any landing forces would need to be resupplied with weapons, food and medicines across the Taiwan Strait that separates the two, it added. ""The nation's military has the advantage of the Taiwan Strait being a natural moat and can use joint intercept operations, cutting off the Communist military's supplies, severely reducing the combat effectiveness and endurance of the landing forces."" China would also need to keep some of its forces in reserve to prevent any foreign forces joining in to help Taiwan and to keep close watch on other fractious areas of China's border, like with India and in the South China Sea, the ministry said. ""U.S. and Japanese military bases are close to Taiwan, and any Chinese Communist attack would necessarily be closely monitored, plus it would need to reserve forces to prevent foreign military intervention,"" it added. ""It is difficult to concentrate all its efforts on fighting with Taiwan."" Experts say though that China has other means at its disposal to bring Taiwan to its knees short of a full out invasion, including a blockade or targeted missile attacks. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is overseeing a military modernisation programme to make the island harder to attack, making the military more mobile and with precision weapons like longer-range missiles to take out an attacking force. The government is planning an extra T$240 billion ($8.66 billion) over the next five years in military spending to go mostly toward naval weapons, including missiles and warships.

12/14/2021,"Joe Morrow, a Minnesota man, was the victim of what many call “banking while Black” after being put in handcuffs after attempting to cash his paycheck inside a U.S. Bank branch in suburban Minneapolis last October. Morrow told KSTP-TV reporters that despite having an account with the bank, employees at a branch in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, “were all looking at me and just staring at me and then looking at the check and then staring at me again. And I’m already knowing what they’re thinking — that the check fake.” Morrow, who moved to Minnesota from Mississippi last year and worked as an “order picker,” said the incident began well before the police had arrived at the bank where he attempted to cash a check for roughly $900. The man said he was informed by the bank’s manager, John Askwith, that the check was fraudulent and that “you people always coming in here with fake checks.” According to the police report obtained by the station, there had been an increasing amount of fake checks coming to that specific location. When Sgt. Justin Pletcher arrived, police body camera footage showed Morrow already in Askwith’s office, leaning back in a chair, hands folded. The 23-year-old maintained that the check was indeed real. “I work there, bro. And I’m going to report you too, bro, this is racial,” Morrow was heard saying calmly, without expletives, to the manager before he was cautioned about his allegations of racial profiling. “Joe, I need you to calm down, first of all, OK? Don’t say anything stupid, because you’re just going to get arrested for it,” the officer then warned Morrow. Soon afterward, another police officer arrived. The manager, who is blurred in the video, told authorities that the check was fake and that he had already confirmed it with Morrow’s employer. However, it was later proved that Askwith only called for verification after Morrow was removed from his office. When he did, the employer told him the check was genuine. The video shows Morrow quickly getting up from the chair, whereupon he is immediately put in handcuffs. “When I’m coming out of office, I was handcuffed. … People were looking … like I’m a criminal or something,” Morrow said. Pletcher claimed in his report that Morrow was detained after he “flexed at John in a threatening manner,” but Morrow denies those allegations. “I didn’t threaten him. I got up, like, I’m …” he explained. “The guy told the officer, ‘Can you get him out of my office? He might take something on my desk.’ That’s when I got super mad. ‘I’m going to touch something on your desk?’” The clip sparked outrage from people online. One Twitter user wrote, “This is exhausting.” This is exhausting. — Sailor Orbiter (@SailorOrbiter) December 8, 2021 Others called on separate companies who do business with the bank to boycott. “Hi @kroger, your credit cards are issued by @usbank. This is abhorrent service by a US Bank employee,” wrote another person. “Very discriminatory behavior towards this Black customer. As a result, I will be canceling my Kroger’s card! This is 2021 AND NOT 1950.” Hi @kroger, your credit cards are issued by @usbank. This is abhorrent service by a US Bank employee. Very discriminatory behavior towards this Black customer. As a result, I will be canceling my Kroger's card! This is 2021 AND NOT 1950 — Nelson Muna (@neluna11) December 8, 2021 According to the news station, the bank reached a settlement with Morrow almost two weeks after the incident took place, although details of the agreement have not yet been made public. The bank initially claimed “we dispute the facts as they’re being portrayed” when contacted in October by KTSP. Lee Henderson, a spokesperson for U.S. Bank, said then that Morrow’s race had nothing to do with how the bank employees treated him. “After a thorough internal investigation, there is nothing to indicate that the customer’s race or ethnicity played a factor in the service he received at this branch,” Henderson said. By this week the bank was more contrite, with U.S. Bank CEO Andy Cecere issuing a statement Friday, Dec. 10, that said in part: “I am deeply sorry for where we have failed. What Mr. Morrow experienced is not the experience that any customer should have. … Sometimes, unfortunately, we don’t live up to our goals.” More news from our partners: ‘I Just Don’t Feel Comfortable Giving It to You’: TD Bank Teller Refuses to Give Connecticut Black Woman Money from Her Own Account California Couple Sues Appraiser Over What They Say Was Racial Bias In Home Valuation Lowballed By $500K “Attacker” Bola Osundairo Wins Boxing Bout While Hoax Ringmaster Jussie Smollett Takes “L” In Court",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘Don’t Say Anything Stupid, Because You’re Just Going to Get Arrested’: Black Man Handcuffed After Bank Falsely Claims His Paycheck Was Fake",https://news.yahoo.com/don-t-anything-stupid-because-133000429.html
12/14/2021,"By Alexander Marrow and Mark Trevelyan MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Monday it may be forced to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in response to what it sees as NATO's plans to do the same. The warning from Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov raised the risk of a new arms build-up on the continent, with East-West tensions at their worst since the Cold War ended three decades ago. Ryabkov said Russia would be forced to act if the West declined to join it in a moratorium on intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) in Europe - part of a package of security guarantees it is seeking as the price for defusing the crisis over Ukraine. Lack of progress towards a political and diplomatic solution would lead Russia to respond in a military way, with military technology, Ryabkov told Russia's RIA news agency. ""That is, it will be a confrontation, this will be the next round,"" he said, referring to the potential deployment of the missiles by Russia. Intermediate-range nuclear weapons - those with a range of 500 to 5,500 km (310 to 3,400 miles) - were banned in Europe under a 1987 treaty between then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan in what was hailed at the time as a major easing of Cold War tensions. By 1991, the two sides had destroyed nearly 2,700 of them. Washington withdrew from the pact in 2019 after complaining for years of alleged violations revolving around Russia's development of a ground-launched cruise missile that Moscow calls the 9M729 and NATO refers to as the ""Screwdriver"". If NATO is right that Russia has already deployed this system in the European part of the country, west of the Ural Mountains, then Ryabkov's threat is an empty one, according to Gerhard Mangott, an expert on Russian foreign policy and arms control at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. But if Russia's denials are true, he said, then Moscow's warning is ""the final signal to NATO that it should enter into talks with Russia about a freeze-freeze agreement."" He added: ""If NATO sticks with the position not to negotiate about a deal, then we will certainly see Russia deploy the Screwdriver missile at its very western border."" POINT MAN Ryabkov has emerged in recent days as one of Moscow's key messengers as President Vladimir Putin presses for Western security guarantees while facing warnings from the United States and its allies to back away from a possible invasion of Ukraine - something the minister again denied was Russia's intention. He repeated a comparison he made last week between the current tensions and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, which brought the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. Ryabkov said there were ""indirect indications"" that NATO was moving closer to re-deploying intermediate-range missiles, including its restoration last month of the 56th Artillery Command which operated nuclear-capable Pershing missiles during the Cold War. NATO says there will be no new U.S. missiles in Europe and it is ready to deter new Russian missiles with a ""measured"" response that would only involve conventional weapons. But Ryabkov said Russia had a ""complete lack of trust"" in the alliance. ""They don't permit themselves to do anything that could somehow increase our security - they believe they can act as they need, to their advantage, and we simply have to swallow all this and deal with it. This is not going to continue.""

12/14/2021,"As part of his recent overarching weight loss and body transformation challenge, a YouTuber spent 30 days doing mountain climbers. While he only performed the core-torching move for three minutes each day, he found that in concert with his other efforts, he was able to lose more than 30 pounds, dropping from 220 pounds on day one to 188 on day 30. The mountain climber is a simple enough exercise to perform, requires no equipment, and is great for working your core and building upper body strength. Simply start in a plank position, and then alternate driving your knees up towards your chest. Rather than attempting to get as many reps done as quickly as possible, the aim here is to maintain strong form. ""We must be careful when performing this exercise, or we could injure the muscles near the pelvis,"" he says. If you are interested in incorporating mountain climbers into your own workout, he recommends doing five minutes of dynamic stretches as a warmup first. (If you're a beginner and don't think you have the necessary core strength or upper body strength to manage more than one or two mountain climbers, then you can start with an elevated variation, using a box or bench to support the upper body and take some of that pressure off.) He then recommends doing the move for 15 seconds at maximum effort, with three minute intervals in between. ""As you become fitter and more accustomed to mountain climbers, you can increase the number of intervals you perform in a workout and decrease the recovery time in between intervals,"" he says.

12/14/2021,"As a mob of Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows received text messages from multiple Fox News hosts and the president’s son, urging him to convince Trump to issue a statement condemning the violence, according to the House select committee investigating the attack. The text messages are among thousands of documents Meadows has turned over to the committee, according to Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who revealed the messages Monday evening as the panel gathered to pass a resolution to hold Meadows in contempt of Congress. Cheney said Meadows, who served as Trump’s chief of staff during his final months in office, turned over thousands of emails and text messages as part of a previous agreement to cooperate with the panel, but he has refused to testify, despite being ordered to do so by a subpoena. Meadows’s attorney said the former top White House aide believes his testimony is protected by executive privilege. “Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,” Cheney said as she read out loud a text message from Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “Please get him on TV. Destroying everything you have accomplished,” wrote Brian Kilmeade of “Fox & Friends.” Sean Hannity, another Fox News star, asked if Trump could “make a statement” asking “people to leave the Capitol. Cheney also described multiple texts Meadows received from Donald Trump Jr. similarly urging the president to take action. “He’s got to condemn this s*** ASAP,” Trump’s eldest son wrote to Meadows, who replied: “I'm pushing it hard. I agree.” Cheney, a prominent GOP critic of Trump’s actions that day, concluded: “These text messages leave no doubt the White House knew exactly what was happening at the Capitol.” Some of those messages stand in contrast with how some Republican lawmakers, as well as Fox News stars like Tucker Carlson, have portrayed the violent attack on the Capitol. Two Fox News contributors recently quit over a special that downplayed the assault. The revelations came as the House panel voted Monday to make Meadows the third Trump ally it referred for possible criminal penalties for refusing to cooperate with its investigation. The specific text messages revealed by Cheney ahead of Monday’s vote are the latest details to emerge about Meadows’s communications leading up to and during the deadly riot by Trump supporters who sought to overturn the results of last year’s presidential election. In a report issued on Sunday night ahead of the contempt vote, the committee described several specific messages about which it had planned to question Meadows about last week, when he failed to show up for a scheduled deposition. Among the documents described in the contempt report is a Jan. 5 email in which Meadows indicated that the National Guard would be present at the Capitol the following day to ‘‘protect pro-Trump people.” It’s not clear who was the recipient of this message from Meadows, or what it was based on, but it comes amid renewed scrutiny of who is to blame for the National Guard’s delayed response to requests for help from the Capitol Police during the riots. One of the main questions for congressional investigators is whether Trump played any role in that delay. The comment matches up with congressional testimony given by former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller in May, in which he described a conversation with Trump on Jan. 3 in which the president told him to ""do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators that were executing their constitutionally protected rights."" Other messages cited in the contempt report include text messages between Meadows and individuals including members of Congress, on Jan. 6 before, during and after pro-Trump insurrectionists stormed the Capitol. The report also referenced text messages Meadows sent to and received from an organizer of the rally where Trump spoke near the White House before the attack. In addition to correspondence pertaining specifically to Jan. 6, the select committee also described several emails and text messages produced by Meadows that could shed new light on Trump’s attempt to undermine the 2020 election, including messages regarding encouraging Republican legislators in certain key states to send alternate slates of electors to Congress. Some of the messages highlighted in the report appear to reflect direct communication between Meadows and the former president. One such example is a November 2020 text exchange with a member of Congress about contacting state legislators in which Meadows relayed that ‘‘POTUS wants to chat with them.” Another is an email from Dec. 23 regarding the Trump campaign’s effort to challenge election results, in which Meadows wrote, ‘‘Rudy was put in charge. That was the President’s decision.’’ The panel also cited text messages from December 2020 about the effort to install Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general, as well as texts regarding Trump’s infamous Jan. 2 call in which he pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn Biden’s victory in that state. The committee’s interest in many of the records produced by Meadows began to surface last week. One day before Meadows had been scheduled to sit for an initial deposition, his attorney notified the panel that the former Trump aide would no longer be cooperating, citing the panel’s apparent interest in information that, he argued, is covered by the former president’s claims of executive privilege. In a letter to Meadows’s lawyer, select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., disputed this argument, explaining that the committee intended to question Meadows about a number of specific records he’d already turned over without a claim of privilege. Among the records Thompson said the committee sought to ask Meadows about included a Jan. 5 email about having the National Guard on standby, and another email regarding a 38-page PowerPoint briefing titled “Election Fraud, Foreign Interference & Options for 6 JAN” that was to be provided “on the hill.” More details have also since emerged about that PowerPoint briefing. According to the New York Times, the PowerPoint cited by Thompson recommended that Trump “declare a national emergency to delay the certification of the election results,” claiming that China and Venezuela had interfered in the vote. It also included proposals for Vice President Mike Pence to reject electors from “states where fraud occurred” when Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s win on Jan. 6. It had been circulated on Capitol Hill before the Jan. 6 riot by Phil Waldron, a retired Army colonel and proponent of misinformation about fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Waldron told the Times that he did not personally email the PowerPoint to Meadows, but that it was possible Meadows received it from someone else on Waldron’s team. In a separate interview with the Washington Post, however, Waldron said he visited the White House multiple times after the election and spoke with Meadows “maybe eight to 10 times.” According to the Post, Waldron was a cybersecurity consultant who worked with Trump’s outside lawyers, including Rudy Giuliani, to challenge the election results in several key states. He described one particular meeting he and others had with Meadows around Christmas last year in which, he said, Trump’s chief of staff asked what he needed to determine whether the 2020 election had been hacked. Waldron told the Post that his team put together a list for Meadows of IP addresses, servers and other information that he believed should be investigated “using the powers of the world’s greatest national security intelligence apparatus.” Waldron’s account of his interactions with the White House in the days and weeks after the election, along with details that have emerged about the PowerPoint itself, raise new questions about Meadows’s contacts with unsubstantiated theories about voter fraud that were circulating among Trump’s advisers during that time. George Terwilliger, Meadows’s lawyer, told the Times late last week that the PowerPoint was turned over to the Jan. 6 committee because Meadows had simply received it via email and did nothing with it. “We produced the document because it wasn’t privileged,” Terwilliger said. Last week, Meadows filed a lawsuit against the Jan. 6 select committee, arguing that the panel’s “overly broad and unduly burdensome subpoenas” violate his right to free speech as well as his former boss’s powers of executive privilege. President Biden, as the current office holder, has so far waived executive privilege for documents relevant to the select committee’s investigation. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled against Trump’s effort to override Biden’s authority and block the Jan. 6 panel from accessing his White House records.",Politics/Yahoo News,"'Destroying his legacy': Fox News hosts urged White House to act during Jan. 6 riot, committee reveals",https://news.yahoo.com/destroying-his-legacy-fox-news-hosts-urged-white-house-to-act-during-jan-6-riot-committee-reveals-012345866.html
12/14/2021,"Delta Air Lines is exiting three markets to small cities in Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, citing low demand. The airline is also slashing service to four other airports, though will still fly to them from alternate hubs. The move comes as airlines continue to cut unsustainable and unprofitable regional routes. Delta Air Lines is making changes to its domestic network and three small cities in the US are losing service from the carrier indefinitely, with seven routes overall getting cut. Atlanta-based Delta is dropping service to cities in several states across the US, including Wyoming, Wisconsin, Montana, Nebraska, Michigan, Colorado, and Indiana, the airline later confirmed to Insider and The Points Guy first reported. Three cities will lose their service entirely, including Lincoln, Nebraska, and Grand Junction, Colorado, both of which will end January 10, and Cody, Wyoming, where seasonal service was suspended in October 2021 and will not return. ""Due to ongoing travel demand impact from the pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to suspend Delta Connection service to these markets,"" a Delta spokesperson told Insider in an email statement. ""We are working to re-accommodate customers with alternate plans or offer refunds as quickly as possible. We are grateful to all who supported this service throughout the years."" Most of the markets are small towns, which are becoming a common casualty of network adjustments due to low demand and high costs. According to Delta, the four cities that are seeing reduced service will still be served via other Delta hubs beginning January 10. Take a look at the routes and cities that Delta will cut indefinitely: Between Detroit, Michigan, and La Crosse, Wisconsin: Delta is dropping its service from Detroit to La Crosse, though it will still serve the airport from Minneapolis, and American offers flights from Chicago. Between Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Great Falls, Montana: Delta is cutting its service from Minneapolis to Great Falls, though it will still serve the airport from Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, Alaska offers flights from Seattle, United operates from Denver, and Allegiant flies from Las Vegas and Phoenix-Mesa. Between Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Lincoln, Nebraska: Delta is ending its service from Minneapolis to Lincoln indefinitely, cutting the only route Delta operated to the city. However, United still offers flights from Denver and Chicago. Between Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Marquette County, Michigan: Delta is dropping its service from Minneapolis to Marquette County, though it will still offer flights from Detroit, and American flies from Chicago. Between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Cody, Wyoming: Delta is cutting its service from Salt Lake City to Cody indefinitely, ending flights to one of the gateways to Yellowstone National Park. However, United still offers flights from Denver. Between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Grand Junction, Colorado: Delta is dropping its service from Salt Lake City to Cody, exiting the market entirely. However, the airport still had a number of route options, including United and Frontier from Denver, Allegiant from Phoenix-Mesa, Las Vegas, and Santa Ana, California, and American from Dallas/Fort Worth, Phoenix Sky Harbor, and Los Angeles. Between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Indianapolis, Indiana: Delta is dropping its service from Salt Lake City to Indianapolis, though it will still offer flights to the Indiana city from Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, New York-JFK, New York-La Guardia, and Minneapolis. The airport is also served by nine other US carriers, like Southwest, Spirit, and Frontier. Delta is not the only carrier exiting small markets. In early November, United Airlines pulled out of 11 cities indefinitely, leaving some markets with just one commercial operator. The airline cited unsustainability for the long term as a reason for its exit. According to Henry Harteveldt, president and travel industry analyst of Atmosphere Research Group, these small cities are expensive to operate to and low demand has made it difficult to be profitable. However, he emphasized that the pandemic has impacted airlines' decisions and companies do not have a moral obligation to serve small markets. ""In the wake of the most financially brutal 18 months that the global airline industry has experienced due to the COVID pandemic, airlines are going to seek out markets that they believe will give them an advantage, but if a city isn't profitable, they will cut it,"" Harteveldt told Insider in November. Meanwhile, American has also cut service to small cities, like New Haven, Connecticut, in September, according to the Hartford Courant. Avelo Airlines is the only commercial operator out of the city, having launched operations in November.

12/14/2021,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots. The Air Force gave its forces until Nov. 2 to get the vaccine, and thousands have either refused or sought an exemption. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Monday that these are the first airmen to be administratively discharged for reasons involving the vaccine. She said all of them were in their first term of enlistment, so they were younger, lower-ranking personnel. And while the Air Force does not disclose what type of discharge a service member gets, legislation working its way through Congress limits the military to giving troops in vaccine refusal cases an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions. The Pentagon earlier this year required the vaccine for all members of the military, including active duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Each of the services set its own deadlines and procedures for the mandate, and the Air Force set the earliest deadline. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the vaccine is critical to maintaining the health of the force and its ability to respond to an national security crisis. None of the 27 airmen sought any type of exemption, medical, administrative or religious, Stefanek said. Several officials from the other services said they believe that so far only the Air Force has gotten this far along in the process and discharged people over the vaccine refusal. As a result, they were formally removed from service for failure to obey an order. Stefanek said it is also possible that some had other infractions on their records, but all had the vaccine refusal as one of the elements of their discharge. It is not unusual for members of the military to be thrown out of the service for disobeying an order— discipline is a key tenet of the armed services. As a comparison, Stefanek said that in the first three quarters of 2021, about 1,800 airmen were discharged for failure to follow orders. According to the latest Air Force data, more than 1,000 airmen have refused the shot and more than 4,700 are seeking a religious exemption. As of last week, a bit more than 97% of the active duty Air Force had gotten at least one shot. Members of the Navy and the Marine Corps had until Nov. 28 to get the shots and their Reserve members have until Dec. 28. Army active duty soldiers have until Wednesday, and members of the Army National Guard and the Reserves have the most time to be vaccinated, with a deadline of next June 30. Across the military, the vaccine reaction has mirrored that of society as a whole, with thousands seeking exemptions or refusing the shots. But overall the percentage of troops — particularly active duty members — who quickly got the shots exceeds the nationwide numbers. As of Dec. 10, the Pentagon said that 96.4% of active duty personnel have gotten at least one shot. The number plummets to about 74%, however, when the Guard and Reserve are included. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 72% of the U.S. population 18 and older have gotten at least one shot. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made it clear that the Guard and Reserve are also subject to the mandate, and has warned that those who fail to comply risk their continuing members in the military. But that has proven to be contentious. Oklahoma’s Republican governor and the state attorney general have already filed a federal lawsuit challenging the military mandate for the state's Guard. Gov. Kevin Stitt — the first state leader to publicly challenge the mandate — is arguing that Austin is overstepping his constitutional authority. Stitt had asked Austin to suspend the mandate for the Oklahoma National Guard and directed his new adjutant general to assure members that they would not be punished for not being vaccinated. Austin rejected the request and said unvaccinated Guard members would be barred from federally funded drills and training required to maintain their Guard status. Oklahoma's adjutant general, Brig. Gen.

According to The Observer, Christopher Trogan, a lecturer in Fordham University's English department was terminated because of his response to an incident on Sept. 24 where he mixed up the names of two students who walked into class late. The students allegedly felt disrespected after the incident and believed the mistake was made because the two are both Black. Trogan emailed his students in the Composition II class shortly after the incident occurred and addressed the mixup, apologizing for what he did. ""The offended student assumed my mistake was because I confused that student with another Black student,"" Trogan said in the email. ""I have done my best to validate and reassure the offended student that I made a simple, human, error. It has nothing to do with race."" OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY PLACES PROFESSOR ON LEAVE AFTER INTERVIEW DEFENDING 'MINOR-ATTRACTED PERSONS' The article said that of the two students who were involved in the mixup, one of them claims that Trogan repeatedly used the wrong name throughout four classes ""I felt really disrespected,"" they said. ""I did not feel heard because every time he (misnamed me) I would tell him, and it just seemed like he would brush it off or that he did not care."" The email Trogan sent to students also outlined ""everything he has done for minorities,"" according to the newspaper, and stated that the English class is ""centered specifically and explicitly around issues of justice, equality, and inclusion."" Trogan added that his ""entire life"" has been focused on the issues of justice, equality, and inclusion and listed what he has done in relation to racial justice during his career. PROFESSOR SOUNDS ALARM ON LIBERALS' 'WOKE MATH' MOVEMENT: WE'RE 'GOING BACKWARDS CULTURALLY' Eva Badowska, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences and associate vice president, arts and sciences, told Trogan on Sept. 26 that he was suspended from his job with pay and benefits, noting that he was under investigation by Fordham University. Badowska notified Trogan that he was terminated on Oct. 29. However, Trogan said in an email to students following the termination that he wasn't informed of why he was being investigated until his termination. ""I was never informed of the charges against me, nor of the nature of the investigation of which I was the subject,"" Trogan wrote on Oct. 29. ""I was kept completely in the dark."" Trogan told the newspaper that in the letter of termination, Badowska cited the basis of his firing was the email he sent to students on Sept. 24. The other student involved in the mixup, Chantel Sims, said that Trogan's response to the incident wasn't necessary. ""It seemed a little excessive, like all you needed to do was say sorry and it would have been fine,"" Sims said. ""We were not actually that upset about him mixing up our names. It was more so the random things he would throw into the response."" A Fordham University spokesperson declined to comment because Trogan might take private action against Fordham University.",U.S./Fox News,Fordham University lecturer fired after mixing up names of two Black students,https://news.yahoo.com/fordham-university-lecturer-fired-mixing-223139230.html

12/14/2021,"By Nikolaj Skydsgaard COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Former Danish immigration minister Inger Stojberg, known for her hardline stance in that role, was handed a 60-day prison sentence on Monday by an impeachment court for having illegally ordered the separation of under-age couples seeking asylum. Stojberg was accused of knowingly breaking the law in 2016 by ordering the separation of all asylum-seeking refugee couples where at least one was under 18 years of age, a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under Danish and human rights law, couples must be assessed individually, implying that the minister's order to separate all underage couples was illegal. A total of 23 couples were separated. ""I'm very, very surprised. I think it is the Danish values ​​that have lost,"" Stojberg told reporters. ""I wished and still wish to protect these girls."" The right-wing politician, minister from 2015-19 for the Liberal Party, has repeatedly denied giving any illegal order, saying the aim was to stamp out child marriages and protect underage girls. Stojberg was considered one of the main architects behind Denmark's tough immigration policies, such as allowing authorities to confiscate asylum seekers' jewellery. ""I'm going to take my punishment with my head held high,"" she said. The case started when a Syrian couple complained to the country's ombudsman in 2016 after they were placed in separate asylum centres. A commission launched to investigate the case, also known as the ""child bride case"", concluded that the order was ""clearly illegal"". Twenty five of the 26 judges agreed to convict Stojberg in only the sixth impeachment court of its kind in the Nordic country in more than 170 years and first since 1995. ""We are satisfied with the verdict,"" prosecutors Jon Lauritzen and Anne Birgitte Gammeljord told reporters. ""It's a historic case."" The verdict is final and cannot be appealed.
