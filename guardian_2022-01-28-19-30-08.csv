1/28/2022,"Rafael Nadal has revealed that during some of the lowest points of his six-month injury layoff last year he had conversations with his team and family about the possibility that he may have to “say goodbye” to tennis. Following his 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 victory over Matteo Berrettini on Friday to reach his sixth Australian Open final, Nadal spoke candidly about the uncertainty surrounding his future prior to his return to competition. “I went through a lot of challenging moments, a lot of days of hard work without seeing a light there,” said the 35-year-old. “But still working and still receiving plenty of support from my team and from my family, too, without a doubt. A lot of conversations with the team, with the family about what can happen or what gonna happen if the things continue like this, thinking that maybe is a chance to say goodbye.”  Following the loss of his French Open title in June, Nadal was forced to spend the best part of half a year away from the tour due to a recurrence of a long-standing foot injury which he has suffered from since childhood. The Spaniard attempted to compete at the Citi Open in Washington in August but pulled the plug on his season shortly afterwards. “For a long time I wasn’t able to practice,” said Nadal. “Sometimes I went on court and I was able to practice 20 minutes, sometimes 45, sometimes zero, sometimes two hours, but have been very, very rough in terms of imagine myself playing at the best-of-five at this moment.” Asked about how tough the past few months have been, Nadal noted that his issues do not compare to the loss people around he world have suffered during the pandemic. “Of course my months are not tough at all comparing to a lot of families that lost a lot of people,” he said. “But in terms of personal thing, yeah, because of course every day have been an issue in terms of problems on the foot.” Despite returning to compete at the highest level, Nadal insists his foot issues will remain until the end of his career, but in Australia he has been able to manage them and succeed. “The doubts gonna be here probably for the rest of my career, without a doubt, because I have what I have and that’s something that we cannot fix. But for me it’s amazing, and I’m super happy to be able to compete for the last three weeks at the level that I am doing.” He continued: “Not only about tennis, that’s for sure. It’s surprising for me to be able to play at the level that I am playing, but just compete and play tennis at the high level again, facing the most important players of the world, for me, it’s something unbelievable, no?”",Sport/Sport,Rafael Nadal reveals he considered ‘saying goodbye’ to tennis last year,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/rafael-nadal-reveals-he-considered-saying-goodbye-to-tennis-australian-open
1/28/2022,"Sanjeev Gupta thanked the Tory minister Nadhim Zahawi for his “personally instrumental” role in enabling Greensill Capital to make taxpayer-backed Covid business support loans, in a letter released by the government. Greensill collapsed last year, sparking a lobbying scandal involving the former prime minister David Cameron and a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation into more than £300m of loans to businesses linked to GFG Alliance, the metals conglomerate run by Gupta, under the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loans Scheme (CLBILS).  Last year the National Audit Office said the government-owned British Business Bank (BBB), which has now suspended government guarantees backing the loans, gave Greensill Capital access to the scheme without subjecting the firm to detailed checks, leaving taxpayers facing a £335m loss. It has emerged that in October 2020 Gupta sent a letter to Zahawi, then a minister in the business department (BEIS), thanking him for getting the bank to approve Greensill’s access to the loan scheme. “Since you were personally instrumental in getting the BBB’s approval for Greensill Capital to provide financial assistance under the CLBILS programme, it would be very fitting if you could join us to mark this special moment that provides relief to thousands of workers,” said Gupta in the letter, released following a freedom of information request lodged by the Financial Times. In the letter, Gupta went as far as inviting Zahawi, who was promoted to education secretary in the autumn, to a “small gathering” at his steelworks in Rotherham to mark the Greensill loan success. The letter was sent days before a formal investigation into Greensill and the loans to GFG-linked firms was launched. “The department does not recognise the assertion made in Mr Gupta’s letter that Nadhim Zahawi played a role in securing the bank’s approval to accredit Greensill Capital,” said BEIS. GFG declined to comment. BEIS stated that Zahawi “did not respond to the letter, nor did he make any subsequent visit to a GFG Alliance site”. The FoI also revealed that “a text exchange or phone call between Sanjeev Gupta and Nadhim Zahawi took place at an unknown date” in relation to “Covid assistance”, according to the FT. In the FoI response, BEIS disclosed that there “was no longer an electronic record of the communication stored on the device used by Nadhim Zahawi, which was his personal mobile phone”. However, according to “information held about the communication” at BEIS, the minister explained to the steel baron that “requests would need to be directed through BEIS officials”, said the FT. A spokesperson for Zahawi said the decision to accredit Greensill was taken independently by the British Business Bank. “The government was not involved in the decision to accredit Greensill,” he said. “The decision was taken independently by the British Business Bank, in accordance with their usual procedures.” The spokesperson said GFG’s request for assistance was referred to Zahawi by its local Labour MP, and Zahawi told Gupta that requests would need to be directed through department officials. “The claim that Nadhim was instrumental in securing approval is little more than flattery from GFG in an overwritten letter from their PR team,” said the spokesperson. “He did not respond to the letter, or attend the event.” Greensill Capital specialised in supply chain finance, where businesses borrow money to pay their suppliers, but collapsed last March after losing insurance cover for loans issued to its customers. It emerged that former prime minister Cameron sent 62 text messages to former colleagues pleading for them to help, while earning millions of pounds as an adviser to Greensill. He had also previously lobbied ministers and civil servants across the government to give Greensill approval to hand out Covid loans. Intensive text message lobbying of ministers and high-ranking civil servants on behalf of Greensill Capital showed a “significant lack of judgment”, an official parliamentary inquiry has found. The Treasury select committee said it was inappropriate for the ex-prime minister to send 62 messages to former colleagues pleading for them to help the bank, in which Cameron held a “very significant personal economic interest”. Cameron earned millions of pounds as a boardroom adviser to Greensill, the lending start-up founded by Australian banker Lex Greensill. Cameron last year disclosed a series of text messages lobbying ministers and civil servants across the government to give his employer approval to hand out Covid loans. A parliamentary inquiry found that Cameron showed a “significant lack of judgment” but did not break lobbying rules. It said: “That reflects on the insufficient strength of the rules.” In June 2020, Cameron texted Zahawi: “Lex Greensill  … says you are being v helpful over HMT and CBILS programme,” according to the former prime minister’s disclosures to the Treasury select committee, which did not include a response from Zahawi.

1/28/2022,"British firms have been urged to bolster their digital security over concerns of possible Russian cyber-attacks linked to the growing political crisis over the conflict in the Ukraine. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the GCHQ intelligence agency, has updated its guidance telling firms to “build resilience and stay ahead of potential threats”.  “UK organisations are being urged to bolster their cybersecurity resilience in response to malicious cyber-incidents in and around the Ukraine,” said the NCSC. The NCSC said that although it was investigating malicious cyber-incidents in the Ukraine, “which are similar to a pattern of Russian behaviour seen before in previous situations”, it was not aware of any “specific threats” to UK organisations. The NCSC is concerned that businesses could be targeted after the UK, US and European Union issued warnings to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, against attacking Ukraine after deploying 100,000 troops on its borders. “While we are unaware of any specific threats to UK organisations in relation to events in Ukraine, we are monitoring the situation closely and it is vital that organisations follow the guidance to ensure they are all resilient,” said Paul Chichester, director of operations at the NCSC. A cyber-attack on Ukraine government websites earlier this month warned the public to “be afraid and expect the worst”, which Ukraine said was orchestrated by Russia. “Over several years, we have observed a pattern of malicious Russian behaviour in cyberspace,” said Chichester. “Last week’s incidents in Ukraine bear the hallmarks of similar Russian activity we have observed before.” The guidance, which is primarily aimed at larger organisations, comes after the NCSC warned businesses in the UK’s critical national infrastructure – such as energy, water supply, transportation and telecommunications – about specific vulnerabilities Russian hackers have been known to exploit.",News/UK news,UK firms warned over possible Russian cyber-attacks amid Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/uk-firms-warned-over-possible-russian-cyber-attacks-amid-ukraine-crisis
1/28/2022,"Rafael Nadal lays down his towel, spreads it across two parallel court-side advertising boards. He gently tugs at the near corners to ensure it is taut. Then looks at it again, pulls the far right-hand corner just a little. He squinches his face and surveys the symmetry, pats it with his hand. Content, he turns on his heels towards the baseline, ready for his serving ritual. In the quarter-finals against Denis Shapovalov, Nadal completed his shirt-tug, hair-tuck, face-wipe routine 146 times. He won 100 of those points over the course of five sets, in four hours and eight minutes. He lost 4kg in sweat under the sun.  Two days later, against Matteo Berrettini, it was only 102 serves (71 of those won), over four sets, and two hours and 55 minutes. This time we do not know his post-match weight but we do know Nadal when we see him. Defying the physics of his breaking body and straightening his towel throughout all the suffering and fighting he has poured into his near-two-decade career. “We need to suffer, we need to fight,” he said afterwards. “And that is the only way to be where I am today.” With each passing match at the Australian Open, Nadal’s march towards that coveted 21st grand slam title becomes clearer. Maybe not easier, but at least more deliberate. The Spaniard cannot see the stars aligning – the roof is rolled out over Rod Laver Arena and above it a thick blanket of cloud throws thick droplets over Melbourne Park. A storm has been brewing here all week, and now everybody is finally acknowledging it – except for the man right in its eye. It is unclear what the cogs inside Nadal’s brain are doing as he shrugs his shoulders post-match and reiterates that he is “still very far from the No 21, no?”. That he does not even care so much for that ubiquitous No 21. Or that he could win his first Australian Open since 2009. He is not even all that fazed, he says, with winning this specific Australian Open. Rather, he simply feels alive to be playing tennis at all. Nadal’s apparent lack of a penchant for statistics means he may not have realised his very presence in this semi-final means at least one member of the big three has now made the final four in 70 of the past 71 grand slams. The only blip on that radar is the 2020 US Open, which Nadal and Roger Federer sat out and Novak Djokovic defaulted in the fourth round. There may well have been another in 2022 given Federer and Djokovic are absent and Nadal’s 35-year-old body was not supposed to be in any condition to contest this tournament. The congenital foot injury which has so heavily restricted his ability to compete over the last two years had him basically retired little more than six weeks ago. “Every day have been an issue in terms of problems on the foot,” he said. “The doubts are gonna be here probably for the rest of my career without a doubt, because I have something that we cannot fix.” It is evident in his shuffle, a quick sort of orthotic-assisted stride which punctuates every other point. His injuries over the years are so well-documented they are basically remembered by heart. The hip, the back, the hamstring. “A lot of them you know,” he says, “and some of them you don’t.” And so he conducts most of his business from the court’s central corridor – whatever reduces the load – backing Berrettini into both corners. The Italian especially does not like his left side, and by the end of the match his unforced error count is up at 39. Rafa continues to surprise the public even more than he surprises himself. And perhaps the person most in shock is the exiled Djokovic, who undoubtedly watched every minute of this match in Belgrade in the knowledge that there is no guarantee he will be allowed to contest another major so long as he is not vaccinated. Nadal’s other fellow near immortal, Federer, is 40 with a dodgy knee and may well not have a chance to add to his own 20-slam tally. As it happens, this is Nadal’s first grand-slam appearance, over almost 19 years since his debut at Wimbledon in 2003, in which neither Djokovic nor Federer are joining him. “I just feel happy to be part of this amazing era of tennis, sharing all these things with another two players, that’s it,” he says. “In some ways it doesn’t matter if somebody achieves one more or one less.” The court-side crowd clearly had different ideas, and rode every wave of emotion through Nadal’s fast start and third-set slow-down. In the fourth he finally had his ascendancy. He watched the net bulge with Berrettini’s final shot and then stood smiling, still as a statue, before pounding the air with his fist. It was his first real show of emotion of the entire match. Then he embraced his opponent at the net, returned calmly to his bench and neatly laid out his towel.",Sport/Sport,Tug. Tuck. Wipe.

1/28/2022,"My earliest reading memoryWhen I was four or five we had a cottage in Michigan and the previous owners had left some books behind. I was besotted with a children’s book about a lady toad with a big calico hat and a nasty temper. My favourite book growing upA book I found in my public grade school library, illustrated, about American history. I was nine and it was in Evanston, Illinois. All I can remember is a passage about Ben Franklin in Philadelphia who, exceptionally, wasn’t a Quaker: “The friendliest friend in the City of Friends wasn’t a Friend at all.” It was a big format book with plasticised covers. I liked it because it was clever and gave me talking points.  The book that changed me as a teenagerI was 12 when I read The Catcher in the Rye. That and the movie Rebel Without a Cause, which I saw when I was 15, were the first works of art that spoke to me in my own language. That both were “rebellious” without being political suited a teen in the Eisenhower years. The writer who changed my mindWhen I was 16 and a very horny if guilt-ridden gay boy I read Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice, which excited me because it was about homosexual desire, unsatisfied, which seemed right. I was being psychoanalysed, hoping to go straight. I read it on Walloon Lake in Michigan with lots of knotty pine staring at me. The book that made me want to be a writerWhen I was 17 at my Midwestern boarding school I wrote an essay on Proust. I had a theory of my own: that homosexual lying, in which one heterosexualises one’s experiences and makes one’s boyfriends into girls (the so-called Albertine strategy), is a crucial step in the novelist’s development (which would explain why there are so many great gay fiction writers). To reinvent one’s own experiences and to supply the new version with convincing details and to make all those substitutions consistent (and to remember them) is already the first major step in creating, as Proust did, a sublime autofiction. Of course that theory was (and is) very self-serving. The author I came back toI’ve read Proust several times in my life. As a teen I was pretty much faking it, only read part of it, pretended I could read French, drew the wrong conclusions from it (it is a damning critique of snobbism but reading it made me more snobbish). In my late 20s I read Proust with a group of New York friends and we drew life lessons from it and recognised our acquaintances in his characters. Finally I wrote a short biography of Proust in Paris in 1998, my last year (of 16) of living in France. This time I read Proust for the first time in French. The book I rereadHenry Green’s Nothing. First as an 11-year-old in Evanston after discovering Green’s books in the open stacks of the public library. I liked the look of them and what I thought was the simplicity of their style. Now I read it every two years as an old man. It makes me sick with laughter. It is about late-middle-age love, blithe selfishness, the rekindling of old passions, sly maneuvering among privileged adults – a treasure house of sharp dialogue and vicious scheming that leads to complete contentment. The book I could never read againI have a book group of two with the novelist Yiyun Li. I suggested we read Evelyn Waugh’s Vile Bodies, which I’d read as a student and thought was terminally sophisticated. When we tried it a year ago I thought it was antisemitic (Father Rothschild!), heavy-handed and unfunny. The book I discovered later in lifeFlaubert’s Sentimental Education. I’d “read” it in my 20s in a desultory, uncomprehending way, but now I loved the Parisian social scenes, the seamless use of history, the progression d’effet, the cynicism about romantic love. I could see why Ford Madox Ford had memorised it entirely and he and Conrad studied it religiously.The book I am currently readingThe Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne, about the ancien régime, the revolution, Napoleon, the restoration, the fall of the Bourbons in 1830, etc. As a Parisian lady who knows everything about court life (Bourbon, Napoleonic and Orleanist), who is a brilliant observer and has a historian’s memory and a gossip’s relish for detail, she is the perfect witness of a chaotic moment. Now I read it between midnight and 2am. My comfort readIn my homebound loneliness, reading is my chief comfort. My comfort read is Lord Chesterfield’s letters to his illegitimate son, a dolt who he was trying to turn into a gentleman with reams of useful advice. It’s the only foreign book of manners that the French thought worth reading. Among other things it is a relic of an age when educated people spoke German, French, Italian and English and knew ancient Latin and Greek.

The promiseThat you can use teabag fabric as a “plaster” to repair and strengthen a broken nail. Is there anything a cuppa can’t fix?  The testThere will always be one nail that breaks and ruins it for everyone else. Such is life. This week, that nail was my pinkie. While retrieving a lipstick from underneath the sofa, I broke a freshly manicured nail, hours before a party. To fix it, I removed the polish, emptied a teabag and cut off two small pieces of fabric – each roughly 5mm square – to cover the break. I then filed the nail down to ensure the tear didn’t worsen and, using tweezers, placed the fabric over the break before covering it with Nailkale Superfood base coat (£15 from Nails Inc) to seal it. After I had repeated the process again, the offending nail – although looking a little lumpy – blended in and lasted a week before I gave in and cut them all short. The verdictThis works. Hurrah! But you could also use nail-polish stickers (Maniko has nice shades) to save faff. If your nails break often, though, find a more long-term solution.

1/28/2022,"Aportrait hangs above a fireplace in a living room. The artist’s hand must have hardly lifted off the page as he traced the sitter’s face. It feels odd to be taking in a piece by such a renowned artist, set above family photos and trinkets. I ask if I can take a photograph to remember it better, but the man sitting behind me in an armchair responds very politely that he’d rather I didn’t. He wasn’t a museum assistant, but a friend of the owner. They had been unable to meet me but allowed me to visit their home, tucked away in a well-heeled suburban street, on the condition that I didn’t reveal any identifying details about the work or its location.  The painting, like thousands of other objects decided to be of pre-eminent artistic interest, is listed under HMRC’s conditional exemption tax incentive (Ceti). Owners are exempt from paying inheritance or capital gains tax when pieces pass to a new owner – either as the result of a death or as a gift – so long as they look after them, keep the items in the UK and make them available for the public to view. Art and tax make surprising bedfellows, and I wanted to find out exactly how the scheme works. It turns out that accessing the art – which includes works by Rembrandt, Rossetti, Goya, Renoir and Degas, among others – is easier in theory than practice. In a little-publicised online database, items can be searched for by category, location, artist and name of work. Descriptions range from the detailed (“A magnificent French circular ivory double mirror-case, each cover carved in relief with the Siege of the City of Love”) to the brief (“Oil painting – Man’s head”). Contact details to arrange viewings are more often than not out of date or incorrect. Out of 25 requests I made over an eight-month period, only six resulted in viewings. A report from 2013 found similar results, with only five appointments made out of 30 inquiries. Emails bounced, contacts had to be hunted down and legal intermediaries chased. In one instance, a surprised wealth manager had no idea what the scheme was, or why she was listed as a contact for a Henry Moore sculpture. When the requests did make it to owners, many were understandably cautious about allowing access to their work, on security grounds. To allay concerns, HMRC suggests asking visitors for identification and/or that viewings can be arranged in public spaces, rather than in private homes, leaving it to owners to arrange insurance and transport. One solicitor asked for a “reasonable charge” (which is allowed under the terms of the scheme) of £100 to arrange a viewing of a Rembrandt, which may not be extortionate given the logistics involved, but is arguably prohibitive for the general public. On occasion, such art is displayed in Britain’s museums or galleries, but for the most part, curators aren’t keen on displacing permanent works for those on short-term loans from private collections. When it was possible to arrange an appointment, speaking with the collectors was just as enjoyable as seeing the art itself. I arranged a viewing of a relief by Barbara Hepworth’s husband, the modernist artist Ben Nicholson. The painter had formed a long-distance friendship by correspondence with the owner, and when he died, he left her the wall-mounted sculpture with his nickname for her marked in pencil on the back of the frame. Being so physically close to the art, and by degrees of connection to the artist, is something no exhibition, no matter how expertly curated, can offer. While not without such moments of joy, the overwhelming difficulty in accessing the art raises the question of whether the tax exemption is worth the lost revenue – an estimated £1bn over the last few decades. But the inefficiency may be attributable to the fact that the scheme was never designed with the general public in mind. It was conceived in 1896 by the Tory government of the day after appeals from owners concerned about the integrity of their artistic collections. The previous Liberal government had introduced the death duty, a tax on the value of an estate, causing frantic landowners to give away their art in order to lower inheritance bills. As a way to keep art in the country, the Tories made any objects that might one day be taken into a national collection exempt. It wasn’t until the 1970s that the public was allowed to view items, and only in 1998 that public access became an absolute requirement. A path from private to full public ownership of art, which would see items taken into the permanent collections of Britain’s galleries, came about in the 1940s, with the acceptance in lieu scheme, which allows inheritance tax bills to be paid for by the transfer of art (among other things) to a public institution or charity. Over the years, both schemes would contribute to keeping the collections of Britain’s many historic buildings intact (including many open to the public as part of the National Trust), but today any overlap between the two is administrative (the same panel of experts decides which items are eligible for both schemes) or informal (a gallery that takes a piece on short-term loan may suggest that they’d one day like to own a piece permanently and put it forward for the acceptance in lieu scheme.) One of the most wonderful things about cultural life in the UK is the democratisation of art – rich or poor, anyone can walk through the doors of any public gallery and gaze at a masterpiece. Any incentive to allow the nation to see works of art that would otherwise be reserved for a few is something to be encouraged further, but it seems as if the Ceti isn’t living up to its promise. If collectors are sceptical about increasing access to their collections then it has to be asked whether we should be subsidising their ownership. For those who want to share their work with the public, the Treasury and the government can better support owners by updating and promoting the scheme, arranging exhibitions and, in the long term, encouraging pieces to be bought for permanent display in galleries up and down the country. Until then, it’s uncertain whether the scheme is preserving our cultural heritage or the tax bills of those fortunate enough to own such great works.

The unidentified plaintiff – a professional choreographer, dancer, model and musician who is named Jane Doe in the lawsuit – and an unidentified friend were invited to the yacht on 30 December 2021 by a male friend.  The lawsuit states that while the man was on the phone to Doe, Brown took it from him and told her “he had heard about her music and urged her to head over to Diddy’s home on Star Island as soon as possible”. On the yacht, the lawsuit alleges, Brown offered Doe a cup containing a mixed drink. As he “offered her tips about starting a career in the music industry”, he allegedly refilled her cup, after which she became “disoriented, physically unstable, and started to fall in and out of sleep”, according to the suit. It claims she was led to a bedroom where Brown closed the door and refused to let her leave. The complaint alleges that he undressed and raped her, and that after he ejaculated inside her, he announced “he was ‘done’”. It alleges that Brown demanded Doe take an emergency contraceptive the following day. Brown responded on Instagram Stories: “I HOPE YALL SEE THIS PATTERN OF 🧢 [lying] whenever im releasing music or projects, ‘THEY’ try to pull some real bullshit.” The Guardian has contacted representatives for Brown for comment. Doe’s lawyer Ariel E Mitchell told Rolling Stone that they wanted to “ensure all parties are held accountable so that we may begin to eradicate this behaviour from our society”. Brown has had several legal troubles since he was convicted of felony assault on his then girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. He has previously been denied entry to the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on grounds of character. Brown, a major R&B figure of the 2000s, is due to release his 10th album, Breezy, later this year.

The man, born in 1938, told them he had not had a driving licence or insurance since he was 12 years old – and had avoided being stopped by police ever since. Nottinghamshire police officers said they just happened to pull over the man driving a three-door Mini One in a Tesco Extra car park in the market town of Bulwell on Wednesday.

1/28/2022,"Rampant illegal logging of protected forests is threatening the cultural survival and livelihoods of indigenous people in Cambodia, according to Amnesty International. Members of the Kuy people, one of the largest of Cambodia’s 24 indigenous groups, told Amnesty how deforestation in two protected forests, along with government restrictions on access have undermined their way of life and violated their human rights.  More than 6,200 hectares (15,300 acres) have been deforested across Prey Lang and Prey Preah Roka protected forests in 2021, according to a report published on Friday. Cambodia has experienced one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, losing about 64% of its tree cover since 2011, according to the report. Richard Pearshouse, Amnesty International’s head of crisis and environment, said: “Rampant illegal logging in Cambodia is posing an existential threat to the country’s remaining primary forests, and the indigenous peoples who depend on them for their livelihoods, their culture and their spiritual practices. “Cambodia’s approach to conservation is characterised by official corruption and a complete disregard for indigenous people’s rights. If the Cambodian authorities don’t change course soon, the country’s protected forests will be illegally logged into oblivion.” The report, based on interviews with 20 community activists protecting the two forests, which are home to significant Kuy populations and contain protected wildlife sanctuaries, said Cambodian authorities were failing in their duty to protect indigenous people’s rights by not adequately policing the areas. Embedded corruption in the government and within the police is fuelling the illegal logging trade, and posing a risk to some of the country’s most important remaining forests, it said. Community members described government officers receiving bribes from timber traders and loggers in return for ignoring illegal activities, said Amnesty. One local activist told the organisation: “The big problem is that the authorities… are only interested in collecting money.” The activist added they had “tried many times” to tell provincial office officials about logging and given them photos and other evidence. “They go to investigate it – but they only investigate it to collect money from the loggers.” Illegal logging activities have had a devastating impact on the Kuy people’s livelihoods. They collect resin from trees, which is sold and used domestically for low-grade lighting and commercially for boat caulk, paints and varnishes. Loggers have targeted resin trees for timber production. Thyda (not their real name) told Amnesty that about 70% of resin trees had been lost in Prey Preah Roka in recent years. “Many people from outside … come and steal our trees when we are not in the forest – especially during the rice season when we are planting saplings or harvesting rice … Sometimes in one day, 30 or 40 resin trees will be cut.” The report also documented how grassroots activists were prevented from carrying out forest patrols to document illegal logging. Ministry of environment officials said the restrictions were allowed under Cambodian law; this is challenged by Amnesty. Neth Pheaktra, secretary of state and spokesperson of Cambodia’s ministry of environment, rejected Amnesty’s claims as “baseless”. He said Kuy people “have full rights to patrols allowed by law and get full cooperation from Ministry of Environment’s forest rangers and authorities”. He added: “The ministry of environment is very glad to emphasise that the large scale of natural resource offences in the protected areas including Prey Lang and Prey Preah Roka Wildlife Sanctuaries are no longer occurring, but there are still small scales of illegal logging.” Amnesty International has previously documented how Cambodian authorities have denied environmental activists access to the rainforests, and how their ban on community patrols allowed illegal logging to continue unchecked.",News/Global development,"Illegal logging threatens Cambodia’s indigenous people, says Amnesty",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/28/logging-threatens-cambodia-indigenous-people-says-amnesty
1/28/2022,"With a slowly unravelled mystery at its centre, Alistair McDowall’s uncanny new play delights in alien time fractures, the chaos of humanity and the unifying feeling of intense loneliness. This is, essentially, a rag-tag episode of Doctor Who. We start with a Victorian medium (an elegantly cruel Rakie Ayola) attempting to contact the dead. When the woman she’s using in her experiments (a chained-up, mud-splattered stranger stolen in the night, played by Ria Zmitrowicz) appears to become possessed, the medium takes it as confirmation of her powers. But she has simply lucked out with her victim, choosing a woman whose being is connected to death and a world in-between time.  The short first half of The Glow is acutely strange. It is equal parts spooky and funny, with blunt dialogue and dreamy lighting. Vicky Featherstone’s production has great control in the way it slowly feeds us information, toying with the confusion it creates as myth and history collide. As we gradually learn more about the woman, Merle Hensel’s brutalist set shifts: the walls close in, time contorts, and the characters begin to glitch and overlap. “Like static,” a character played by the wonderfully comic Fisayo Akinade says, talking about the spirit world. “We’re wrapped around them.” As well being unnerving, The Glow is, for a long time, unmoving. The projected landscapes with dates in bold type, spanning from the end of the 20th century back to 500,000BC, are impressive but synthetic and cold. The temperature changes when Ayola returns as retired nurse Ellen in the 1990s, her character bursting with warmth towards the strange woman on her doorstep. Suddenly the play swells, and McDowall lets love seep in. Not everything works: a knight’s underdeveloped quest slows the action, although his presence allows an entertaining scene where a baffled Ellen patches him up after a sword fight, trying not to ask too many questions. Sci-fi is too rarely done on stage but here McDowall has chosen the perfect medium. How better to tell a story about the perils of immortality and the fear of carrying on alone than through an art form built for impermanence, with stories that can live longer than we do? At the Royal Court theatre, London, until 5 March.",Arts/Stage,The Glow review – myth and history collide in a sci-fi spine-tingler,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/28/the-glow-review-alistair-mcdowall
1/28/2022,"Forewarned is forearmed and clearly, at some stage in late November, Gregg Berhalter and US Soccer sat down, ran the tape, looked through the Edmonton squalls and saw in the frozen Mexican faces all the warning they needed.  In truth they could have saved themselves 90 minutes and read the French advice. Just 19 words of it. “To survive the Canadian winter, one needs a body of brass, eyes of glass, and blood made of brandy.” Louis Armand de Lom d’Arce’s offering was published in the early 1700s but as Canada and the US men meet for their most consequential encounter for a generation, the message still sounds clear through winter’s air. Not least because the exploration that sparked such trauma in the third Baron Lahontan is within a stone’s throw of Sunday’s venue. Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, a stadium sponsored by the country’s beloved coffee chain in a city about 70km south of Toronto, has no great footballing history. This potentially pivotal 2022 World Cup qualifier will in fact be the first time Canada’s senior men have pitched up at the stadium for a competitive international. But John Herdman’s young team are all about creating new stories, new history. When they did just that in November, turning Edmonton’s Commonwealth Stadium into the Iceteca and vanquishing Mexico in a qualifier for the first time since 1976, Canada’s coach pointed to the piles of pitch-side snow and the mercury bottoming out at -9C (16F) with a wind chill of -14C (7F). “Every country uses the terrain to their advantage,” the Englishman said after his finest night yet had seen Canada surge to the top of the Concacaf standings. “We see this as an advantage. There was a genuine opportunity here to bring out the Canadian in our players. They’ve all grown up on plastic pitches in cold conditions so for us, we wanted them to feel like it was home.” So, having brought out the Canadian in his side at the Iceteca, it’s safe to assume that Herdman wants to do something similar on Sunday by choosing to bring the US to Hamilton. Perhaps hoping a place locals call The Donut Box comes with extra frosting. Forecasted conditions predict an icy start to Sunday with a morning wind chill of -21C (-6F) with snow flurries and temperatures around -10C (14F) for the afternoon kick-off. Herdman has worked wonders with this new generation, instilling a positivity and belief that is in marked contrast to almost everything that has come before for the men’s team. But is there justification in his apparent belief that bringing Berhalter’s side to the wide open expanses of Tim Hortons Field, rather than taking things indoors in Vancouver, presents Canada with an advantage? Put simpler … great white north or great white lie? “Well … the more you are exposed to cold the better you may deal with it,” Dr Gordon Giesbrecht tells the Guardian. The University of Manitoba physiologist is the planet’s leading authority on freezing to death. Due to his remarkable research projects he is known as Professor Popsicle. “Our normal response to cold is vasoconstriction, or decreasing blood flow to the skin. So adaptation to continual exposure decreases that. It makes your skin warmer, your hands and feet more functional. Also your receptors will be warmer so you won’t be feeling that cold as much. That in itself will help you cope psychologically. “You know, we’re Canadian, we’re tough. There’s no question that Canadians think they’re tougher than anyone else when it comes to cold. So there’s some of that. It could be a couple of percentages but who knows.” Giesbrecht, whose research has included injecting ice water into his veins, corrected that Sunday’s cold wouldn’t qualify as “extreme”. Berhalter, though, clearly wasn’t going to take any chances. The US opted to acclimatize and host the qualifiers either side of Sunday in cold-weather cities – against El Salvador on Thursday night in Columbus and bringing Honduras to Minnesota on Wednesday. Canada flew back home from their qualifier in Honduras, where daytime temperatures were around 28C (82F), on Thursday. Ultimately the science has largely shown coping in the cold to be a matter of mind. “As soon as your body temperature comes up, there aren’t a whole pile of physiological advantages for someone who lives or trains in a cold environment versus someone coming in from a warmer environment,” Christopher Minson, a physiology professor who studies the body’s response to extreme environments at the University of Oregon, tells the Guardian. Minson works with professional teams and Olympic athletes to help them manage extremes. The progress of players from the US and Canada means the majority of both squads now avoid extremes – by playing in Europe. Sixteen of Canada’s squad are with European clubs to 14 Americans. Nonetheless both physiologists suggested Canadians who spent significant chunks of their lives here would retain those cold weather benefits, particularly in terms of mindset. Essentially, once Sunday’s battle warms up all things are equal – apart from the mind. Canadian striker Cyle Larin’s facial hair may freeze over but it will be nothing new to a player whose club career took him to Turkey but was born and raised in the Toronto area. On the flip side, rapidly icing whiskers may perturb Californian midfielder Sebastian Lletget, for example. “If you’re more accustomed to it, you’re more relaxed,” adds Minson. “You’re not going to have that fear in the mind. I’m a physiologist by trade. I’ve been doing this a long time. But I’m going to say it’s the brain. A large part is the psychology.” Minson also points to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as a factor. In layman’s terms, it’s a tightness in the lungs caused by breathing particularly dry air and familiar minds may control it better by breathing through the nose and avoiding gulps. From altitude at the Azteca to the heat and humidity of Central America and the Caribbean, Concacaf qualification has always been affected by environmental factors. The pandemic-squeezed schedule combining with Canada’s emergence as the most improved team in the region and the world has brought a new factor in from the cold. This is the first competitive January-February qualifying window for the Canadians since 1985, when they were en route to making it to their solitary men’s World Cup. Berhalter seems acutely aware that psychological strength will decide a lot. “It’s a mindset,” he said. “I’ve played in Germany with short sleeves. Once you get running, once you get sweating, you’ll be ready to go.” Berhalter’s former long-time assistant at Columbus Crew, Pat Onstad, was part of multiple Canadian generations for whom winters were barren and inactive. “I remember playing one in November but it was a nothing game against Mexico,” Onstad, whose time in Canada’s goal spanned from 1988 to 2010, tells the Guardian. “It was in Toronto and it started snowing in the second half and I remember thinking ‘God, I wish this game mattered’. Now these games do matter.” Onstad, general manager of MLS side Houston Dynamo, argues that given their wealth of young attacking talent, Canada don’t need conditions on their side. Naturally, he spares a thought for the goalkeepers. Milan Borjan continued his emergence as a Canadian cult favourite that night at the Iceteca when the keeper donned grey sweatpants and a snood-turned-babushka-headscarf. “No lonelier place [than in goals] and no colder place,” laughs Onstad. “But it’s not about style. Just win baby.” That, ultimately, is the aim. If the Donut Box brings out the Canadian in his side and the percentages of Professor Popsicle prove true, they’ll be one step closer to wintering in Qatar. One step closer to making more new history. At which time Canadian blood may well be made of brandy.",Sport/Football,World Cup qualifier: Will Canada use extreme cold as a weapon against the US?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/world-cup-qualifier-will-canada-use-extreme-cold-as-a-weapon-against-the-us
