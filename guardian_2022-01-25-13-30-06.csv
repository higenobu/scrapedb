1/25/2022,"Covid restrictions in New South Wales will remain in place for another month to ensure children can return to school and elective surgery can resume, it was revealed on Tuesday, as the country recorded 76 more deaths from the virus. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet made the announcement as the state recorded 18,512 new Covid cases and 29 deaths.  It means the indoor mask mandate, QR code check-ins, a ban on singing and dancing and the one-person per two square metre density limit in hospitality venues including pubs, nightclubs and cafes will continue until 28 February. When the restrictions were announced earlier this month, Perrottet said they would apply until 27 January. But he said given an expected rise in infections when students return to school later this week and the resumption of non-urgent elective surgery in mid-February, the extension was a “measured and proportionate approach”. “It comes down to priorities. I want there to be confidence in our parents, I want there to be confidence in our teachers that we can get kids back in the classroom for day one, term one,” Perrottet said. “If you’re to ask what’s more important, someone singing or dancing or someone getting their non-urgent elective surgery back, I know what the right approach is.” There are 2943 people in hospital with the virus in NSW, an increase of 127 since Monday, though the number of people in intensive care units has dropped by 13 to 183. Of the 29 people who died, all but one were aged 65 and older. Two had received three vaccine doses, 21 had two doses and six were unvaccinated. Victoria recorded 14,836 new Covid cases, an increase on the 11,695 a day earlier, and 29 deaths. There are 1057 Victorians in hospital with the virus, an increase of 59 since Monday, while intensive care admissions remain stable at 119. With thousands of people continuing to contract the virus daily, Victorian health minister Martin Foley launched a campaign to encourage those with mild symptoms to manage their illness at home. He said since the start of 2022 more than 550,000 people have contracted the virus but just 0.71% have required hospitalisation. The deputy state controller of Victoria’s health system operations, Adam Horsburgh, said the campaign would also “relieve some of the pressure that our frontline doctors and nurses are facing”. “I hear firsthand many of the stories of people who have felt the need to attend an emergency department or call triple zero because they didn’t necessarily know how else to access the advice or support that they needed when they tested positive,” he said. Horsburgh said since a system-wide “code brown” was enacted at state hospitals last week, the number of admissions have either remained stable or improved slightly. However, there are still no plans to resume elective surgery in the state. “We’re very conscious of the impact that the deferral of elective surgery has on everyone on a waiting list but we do not believe at this point in time that the system is in a position to restart elective surgery,” he said. In Queensland, there were 9,546 new Covid infections and 11 deaths, though the state’s chief health officer John Gerrard is confident the state is approaching the peak of its Omicron wave. In South Australia there were 1,869 new cases - the state’s lowest figure for 2022 - and five deaths. The Australian Capital Territory recorded 904 infections and one death, while Western Australia recorded 15 cases. In Tasmania, there were 643 new cases and one person died from the virus. Tuesday marks two years since the first Covid case was detected in Australia.

1/25/2022,"Pictures capturing an apparently frosty moment as outgoing Australian of the Year Grace Tame met prime minister Scott Morrison at the Lodge on Tuesday morning have gone viral on social media, sparking a flurry of memes, and condemnation from Liberal senators. The meeting took place as the 27-year-old advocate against sexual assault arrived at the 2022 Australian of the Year finalists morning tea in Canberra.  In the pictures, Morrison and his wife Jenny are seen grinning broadly for media outside the Lodge while Tame and her fiancé Max Heerey appear stony-faced. Tame became Australian of the Year after her advocacy was instrumental in overturning a Tasmanian law preventing survivors from speaking publicly about their assault. After delivering an impassioned acceptance speech, she sparked a national conversation on the treatment of women and sexual assault in Australia. Tame later told the Betoota Advocate podcast that in the minutes after delivering her speech, Morrison leaned over to her and whispered “gee, I bet it felt good to get that out”. The revelation forced Morrison to defend himself, telling parliament he did not mean it to sound patronising. “That was a very brave statement, that is exactly what I meant when I said that to her on that occasion,” he said. Tame has also used her platform to criticise the government’s handling of rape allegations within Parliament House made by former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins and which are now the subject of criminal proceedings. In an address to the Press Club, Tame was asked what she thought of the prime minister’s handling of the issue after Morrison said he spoke to his wife Jenny, which helped him understand the seriousness of the rape allegations. “Jenny and I spoke last night and she said to me, ‘you have to think about this as a father. What would you want to happen if it were our girls?’,” Morrison had said. “Jenny has a way of clarifying things. Always has. And so, I’ve reflected on that overnight and listened to Brittany and what she had to say.” Tame said it shouldn’t take anyone to have children to have a conscience. “And actually, on top of that, having children doesn’t guarantee a conscience,” she added. The images of the meeting quickly went viral on Tuesday and sparked a flurry of memes. Several Liberal politicians denounced the outgoing Australian of the Year, with senator Hollie Hughes labelling her “immature” and senator James McGrath calling her behaviour “childish”. “The important issues raised by last year’s Australian of the Year must continue to be addressed by all of us,” he wrote on Facebook. “It is a pity her behaviour and attacks on our prime minister are so partisan, political and childish. If she didn’t like being Australian of the Year she should hand back the honour.”",News/Australia news,"Grace Tame and Scott Morrison’s frosty meeting sparks praise, condemnation and memes",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/grace-tame-and-scott-morrisons-frosty-meeting-sparks-praise-condemnation-and-memes
1/25/2022,"The disclosure that Boris Johnson’s fiancee threw him a surprise party during lockdown, prompting a new wave of outrage, dominate the front pages. In the latest alleged breach of rules, No 10 admitted that Carrie Johnson held a party for the prime minister and up to 30 staff on 19 June 2020 despite Covid rules at the time banning indoor social gatherings.  The Guardian’s front page leads with “Johnson faces fresh outrage over birthday party in No 10.” It says sources said an official inquiry had uncovered “appalling evidence of mismanagement” at the heart of Downing Street. No 10 said the PM attended for 10 minutes and denied reports from ITV that he held a party later on 19 June in his Downing Street residence.

1/25/2022,"One person was shot dead and three others were injured when an 18-year-old man opened fire on his fellow students in a packed lecture hall in the German university town of Heidelberg, according to police. The gunman, who was enrolled in the same course in life sciences as the students he attacked, entered the university hall shortly before 12.25pm, while a lecture was in progress, carrying a rifle and a double-barrelled shotgun.  After firing at least three shots into the group of 30 students, the man fled the building and turned one of his weapons on himself. At 12.51pm police discovered his body. His name has not yet been disclosed. Police said two German woman aged 19 and 21 and a 20-year-old German-Italian citizen variously sustained injuries to the legs, back and face. A 23-year-old woman who received a head wound died from her injuries in hospital two hours later. Andreas Herrgen, the head of the Heidelberg public prosecutor’s office, described it as a “horrific deed” that had shaken the city. He said the attack would leave psychological scars on the injured and also other students in the lecture hall, many of whom had feared for their lives. Investigators were not attributing religious or political motives to the attack at this stage, police said. The tabloid Bild reported that investigators were working on the assumption that the attack was motivated by the perpetrator’s psychological problems or relationship issues. The perpetrator, a German citizen registered as living in the nearby city of Mannheim, announced his plan to another person in a WhatsApp message directly before the attack, said Siegfried Kollmar, Heidelberg’s chief of police. In the message, the perpetrator said people “needed to be punished” and that he wanted to be buried at sea rather than at a cemetery. Police said the attacker was believed to have bought his weapons outside Germany, and he and his family were not licensed to carry arms. Germany’s gun control system, one of the most stringent in Europe, restricts the acquisition, possession and carrying of firearms to those with a credible need for a weapon. Heidelberg police arrived on the scene of the attack at 12.30pm, having received seven emergency calls within less than a minute shortly beforehand. People were advised via social media to stay away from the Neuenheimer Feld area, where the science faculties of the city’s university, the university clinic and the botanical gardens are located. Students were told by email to avoid the area. Heidelberg, a picturesque city nestled around the River Neckar, is located south of Frankfurt and has about 160,000 inhabitants. Its university is the oldest and one of the best known in Germany. News of the attack was met with shock among the student community. “It is with great distress and a heavy heart that I have received news of the events on our campus on Neuenheimer Feld,” said Tanja Modrow, the director of Studierendenwerks Heidelberg, a care organisation for the 49,000 students at the university. “Our thoughts are with the injured and families.” Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed his condolences for the victims and other students, saying hearing the news had “broken his heart”. Winfried Kretschmann, the Green state premier of Baden-Württemberg, said he had been “deeply affected” by the events in the university city. “My thoughts are with the families and relatives,” he said. “We are on their side.”",News/World news,Heidelberg student kills one and injures three in lecture hall attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/gunman-dead-and-several-injured-after-shooting-in-heidelberg
