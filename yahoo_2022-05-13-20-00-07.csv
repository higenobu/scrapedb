5/13/2022,"A Russian soldier, who refused to fight in Ukraine, told The Guardian he wants to quit the army. The soldier said that since there is no martial law in Russia, he is not obliged to fight. His comments come amid reports that Putin is looking to impose martial law to keep the war going. A Russian soldier told The Guardian he will quit the army because there is no point in fighting in Ukraine. The soldier, identified only as Dmitri, is a member of a unit currently stationed in Belgorod, a Russian city close to the border with Ukraine, The Guardian reported. He was transferred to the city after he and eight other soldiers in his battalion refused to continue fighting in Ukraine. It is unclear where exactly in Ukraine he fought. ""I have served for five years in the army. My contract ends in June,"" Dmitri told The Guardian. ""I will serve my remaining time and then I am out of here."" ""I have nothing to be ashamed of. We aren't officially in a state of war, so they could not force me to go,"" he added. Dmitri also told The Guardian that he didn't want to continue fighting in Ukraine because he wanted to return to his family alive, rather than ""in a casket."" ""Many of us simply did not want to go back,"" he added. His refusal to fight comes amid reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin will ""likely"" impose martial law to keep the war going in Ukraine, almost four months after the start of his invasion. So far, he has preferred to euphemistically describe the war as a ""special military operation."" The US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers on Tuesday that she believes Putin is ""preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas."" But Russian forces have not made any significant progress in their new offensive in eastern Ukraine ⁠— partly due to low morale and the refusal of some troops ""to obey orders,"" a senior US defense official said earlier this week, as per The Daily Beast.

5/13/2022,"Russian missiles are landing less than 100 miles from Moldova’s borders. Mysterious explosions rocked the headquarters of a security agency in the country’s Russian-backed separatist enclave last month. An economic crisis is looming. And a Russian general has threatened an expansion of the war in Ukraine to the Moldovan border. Unlike other western neighbors that are receiving Ukrainian refugees, Moldova is not a European Union member, and it does not have the resources the bloc has to house and absorb the rapid flow of asylum-seekers. Yet Moldova has received more Ukrainian refugees per capita than any EU state, in a piling-up of crises that has stirred concerns that the tiny southeastern European country could become the first site of spillover violence from Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s minister of foreign affairs and European integration, called on the United States and the EU to pay more attention to Moldova’s struggle, in order to maintain the economy and security of the country. He asked for “flexible and rapid aid to Ukraine’s most vulnerable neighbor.” Since the first Russian bombs fell on the Ukrainian city of Odesa on Feb. 24, Moldova, a country of some 2.6 million people, has received more than 400,000 refugees escaping Vladimir Putin’s devastating war. Most end up transiting to other countries, but about 100,000 have remained. Ukrainians escaping violence to Moldova were received with a warm welcome; volunteers were waiting for refugees with homemade food, a friendly hug and accommodations at private homes. But resources are strained. Unlike Germany, where the average monthly wage is about 3,900 euros, Moldovans make around 500 euros a month. It is an agricultural country with an economy that is largely dependent on fruit and vegetable exports to Russia through Ukraine, a trade now shut down by the war next door. Prices for food, clothes, and gasoline have increased dramatically during the 77-day war. Adding to that, Moldova was recently shaken by a series of mysterious explosions in its breakaway territory of Transnistria, the base for about 1,500 Russian soldiers. “We were deeply concerned,” Popeskto said. “There is a spectrum of scenarios, threats, and risks.” Ukrainian refugees waiting to cross the border on April 9. Just a few days before the explosions, senior Russian commander Rustam Minnekayev spoke of linking Moldova’s separatist area with a Russian-occupied zone in Ukraine along the Black Sea, essentially suggesting an expansion of the conflict into Moldova. It is still unclear who was behind the rocket-propelled grenade attacks on the headquarters of Transnistria’s security services and some Soviet-era radio towers. Moldova’s reformist president, Maya Sandu, condemned the attacks as “attempts to lure the Republic of Moldova into actions that could jeopardize peace.” Russian General Lets Slip a Secret Plan to Invade Another Country and Seize Ukraine’s Entire Coastline Authorities say there are no imminent risks of the expansion of Russia’s war, but the fear that Moldova could turn into the next Ukraine is certainly getting to citizens. The country already has its own internally displaced people, moving westward away from possible attacks. Several thousand people have moved since the start of the war in Ukraine, Popescu told The Daily Beast. Ukrainian refugees embrace after reuniting on their way back to Ukraine along the Ukrainian-Moldovan border on April 12. Moldova faces internal political divisions, too. According to a study conducted by the CBS Research Agency with the help of the Moldovan Institute for Strategic Initiatives, only 40 percent of the population believes that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was unprovoked, while 23 percent of Moldovans accept the Russian justification for the war—that Moscow is defending the Donbas region. The founder of the Moldovan media outlet Newsmaker, Vladimir Solovyev, told The Daily Beast that Moldova’s problems have been “piling up” rapidly, and that the West should realize that “Moldova practically has no army, its security threats are huge, and there is an economic crisis.” Czech PM Says Putin Will Create New Soviet Union if We Don’t Stop Him Now Moldova does have allies in Europe. The EU parliament has adopted a resolution to welcome Moldova’s membership application, which was signed by President Sandu earlier this year. But every application takes time. “Every single Moldovan institution—our intelligence, defense ministry, our ministry of economy, police—everybody is on highest alert,"" Popescu said. “Our society strongly votes for independence, for democracy, for joining the European Union as soon as possible,” the minister told The Daily Beast. “The absolute majority of Moldovan citizens, as well as people in Transnistria, want peace. We hear voices from Russia—some ideas of rebuilding the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union is dead.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/13/2022,"A former Korean YouTuber and pharmacist was sentenced to jail for knowingly spreading a sexually transmitted disease.

Park Seung-jong, who went by the name “Yakult,” was charged with injury and violation of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act and sentenced to eight months in prison and two years of probation.

He was found guilty of knowingly spreading the herpes type 2 virus infection to various women.

“As the accused is a pharmacist, it is established that his actions were deliberate,” Judge Kim Min Joo of the Uijeongbu District Court, said. “As the accused had the Herpes 2 virus, and the victims showed early signs of the virus, it is impossible to deny the relation.”

The former YouTuber and pharmacist broadcaster rose to fame after appearing in entertainment programs, including MBC’s “My Little Television” in 2019.

Park was first accused in 2020 when a victim claimed that he disregarded her wish to use protection during sexual intercourse. She sued Park in June that year.

“Yakult ignored my wish to use a condom,” the victim reportedly said. “After having sex with him, I went to the hospital, as I was not feeling well and was diagnosed with herpes 2.”

The victim told her story online, and, since then, Park has disappeared from the public eye.
