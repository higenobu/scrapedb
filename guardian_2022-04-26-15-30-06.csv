4/26/2022,"Jessica James is a certified mess. A heart-rending breakup has reduced her to Instagram-stalking her ex and rebounding with an emotionally wrecked divorcee who is also groping for closure. A wall of theatre company rejection letters has her doubting her career as a playwright and lashing out at work, where she mentors kid dramaturges. And her younger sister – who, between her husband and Jessica’s own parents back in Ohio, would seem to have it all, is expecting. Barely 25, Jessica is convinced she’s missed her chance to “make it” and the idea that she could spend the rest of her life in this arrested stage of development haunts her as much as the idea of giving up and giving in to first world gender norms. It would all be so tragic if it weren’t so thoroughly relatable and risibly nostalgic. Released on Netflix in 2017, The Incredible Jessica James is an exquisite coming-of-age dramedy – the brainchild of writer-director James Strouse. He not only taps into the insatiable sense of yearning that drove young creatives to pull up stakes for New York after the turn of the century, Strouse also hit a casting home run with Jessica Williams in the lead. Best known as one half of 2 Dope Queens and as a smart alecky Daily Show correspondent during the Jon Stewart years, Williams radiates with intoxicating, Frances Ha-level joy whether dancing on the rooftop of her Bushwick apartment, gushing about her love for theatre or dreaming about a falling piano crushing Damon – the puppy dog ex LaKeith Stanfield plays with hipster-y impotence. To help her move on, Jessica’s bestie Tasha (Noël Wells), another randy theatre kid, sets her up on a blind date with Boone – AKA Divorced Guy, schlubbily embodied by Chris O’Dowd (an IT guy in this picture, too). At first, they seem totally incompatible; she’s a frank-talking free spirit; he eats chicken like a typical man – which, to Jessica’s palate, is even more gross than childbirth. Yet they drop their guards quickly and wind up hooking up that same night. After entering into a pact to Instagram stalk each other’s ex to help wean them off their obsessions, they’re as good as exclusive. There is so much to love about this film. The soundtrack downshifts from fizzy indie pop around Brooklyn to death metal when Jessica goes back to Ohio for her sister’s baby shower. Jessica’s kid mentees are just the right mix of sweet and whip smart. The Tony-winning playwright Sarah Jones shows up as herself, albeit as a sort of sage on the mountaintop to whom Jessica turns seeking the meaning of life. A male Karen shows up at random in one dream sequence. It has everything an east coast creative could want in a film: sentimental Brooklyn vistas, existential dread and the odd improv exercise. But the film’s greatest feat is how it lets Jessica just be. Yes, she’s a bit professionally adrift, but she is certain of her talent and passionate about her field. Yes, she’s on the rebound, but she knows she’s the rarest of catches. (“A unicorn,” she calls herself.) Yes, she’s a Black woman entangling herself with a white Irishman, but the whole affair doesn’t devolve into a disquisition on interracial relationships or the “goodness” of Black men. At the end of the day she’s just another tormented millennial, desperately trying to figure out her own shit. Take note, Hollywood execs: this is what true inclusion on screen looks like. It’s a film just because. Jessica, as she herself says, doesn’t have to put herself through any of this drama. She does it simply because she must! Of course it’s not all smooth sailing for Jessica and Chris, but the tack their relationship takes avoids the usual rom-com tropes. Throughout, Williams showcases the full range – from goddess extrovert to insecure child of divorce to laugh-out-loud hilarious. Without doubt, she proves herself more than up to the task of being a leading lady, even though subsequent projects such as the Fantastic Beasts film franchise or the HBO romcom series Love Life haven’t really extended her that chance. But there’s good news for us fans of The Incredible Jessica James. Williams and Strouse have reportedly reunited to develop a Showtime comedy series about an aspiring science fiction writer coming of age in Brooklyn. And if this new project comes together anywhere near as seamlessly as The Incredible Jessica James – a self-proclaimed sucker for “dialog-driven dramas that explore the human condition” – then odds are good Williams and Strouse’s first film will hardly be the last of their streaming gems.

4/26/2022,"Good morning, and welcome to the second First Edition. (We’ll stop counting now, but please do keep sending your incredibly helpful feedback by hitting reply.) I spent quite a lot of yesterday and this morning trying to think of a more colossally fatuous charge an MP could face than the claim Angela Rayner deployed a “Basic Instinct ploy to distract Boris” in parliament, and, nope, can’t do it. So at least it was pioneering. As Gaby Hinsliff wrote in her column: “This is probably going to shock a lot of people, but Angela Rayner has legs. What’s more… sometimes you can see them”. As well as breaking new ground in baseless misogynist absurdity, the Mail on Sunday story has now prompted 5,000 complaints. Yesterday the newspaper’s editor was summoned to meet the Speaker of the House of Commons. Conservative whips said they were trying to identify the MoS’s anonymous source, while Boris Johnson said he would unleash “the terrors of the earth” on the MP responsible, just as soon as they tell him who they are. Gobsmacking though the story is, it’s also absolutely nothing new, as Caroline Davies’ potted history – from ‘Legs-it’ to ‘the great cleavage divide’ to ‘calm down, dear’ – makes clear. For today’s newsletter, Nimo Omer and I spoke to six female politicians about their experiences of misogyny in parliament and the press – each grindingly familiar, each with its own ugly specificity. First, here are the headlines – and do read on below for a pick of the day’s reads, the front pages, and a bit of good news in the Upside. Ukraine | Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov accused Nato of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine ahead of US-hosted talks in Germany on military aid for Kyiv.

Politics | The UK’s top civil servant privately warned Boris Johnson not to force Whitehall staff back to the office, the Guardian reveals. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s campaign against remote working was called “Dickensian” by cabinet colleague Nadine Dorries. France | Emmanuel Macron is expected to name a new prime minister after his victory in Sunday’s presidential election. Analysts see the minister for work, Élisabeth Borne, as the most likely choice to take the job until June’s parliamentary elections. HRT | Sajid Javid is being urged to change the law to let pharmacists alter prescriptions during medicine shortages, as it emerged that some women are travelling hundreds of miles to seek hormone replacement therapy products. Caroline Nokes: ‘The Mail on Sunday used a picture of my hold-ups’ “Have I had anything like this? Oh god, yes. Any woman you talk to in politics has fallen victim to this – both the unpleasant, demeaning comments of colleagues, and the way they’re then picked up and run with in the media. Partly because of my age, and partly because I’m chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, I’m treated very differently today to how I was 12 years ago. “In 2010, the Mail on Sunday used a picture where the tops of the hold-ups I was wearing were visible. The picture was about eight years old – they’d really trawled for it. It was just so belittling. Now I always think very carefully about what I wear. “I only buy clothes I know will be long enough, and if I’m doing media, I wear trousers, so that nobody gets a shot up my skirt, which I learned from a photo which appeared after I got out of the car to attend my first cabinet meeting. Then there was the article after David Davis mistook Claire Perry for me, and she made a funny retort [referencing his “it’s DD for me” leadership campaign], and it got written up in a way that actually compared our boobs. “The benches in the House of Commons are uncomfortable, they’re difficult to sit on. And I’m always extremely conscious of how I’m sitting, and not moving around, because of all this. That’s the kind of thing you find yourself having to think about. So, no, the story didn’t surprise me. But it is utterly hideous.” Caroline Nokes is the Conservative MP for Romsey and Southampton North Harriet Harman: ‘It’s a disgusting thing to say’ “Let’s be really clear about what these unnamed MPs are accusing Angela Rayner of: it’s flashing, basically. It’s a disgusting thing to say. Boris Johnson has not sought to minimise it, and that’s good, but we need action. If it was happening at any other work place, there would be an investigation. “Because of stuff like this, female MPs are endlessly preoccupied with what should I wear, what shouldn’t I wear, am I too glamorous or too frumpy, how should I act, and will it be used against me. We shouldn’t be required to have eternal vigilance. “The reports along these lines in relation to me are too numerous to mention. But it’s younger women who are seen as particularly threatening, and I haven’t been young for a while. It’s an attempt to silence us, and women won’t shut up.” Harriet Harman is the MP for Camberwell and Peckham and former deputy leader of the Labour party Shami Chakrabarti: ‘Spin doctors put it about that I must be having an affair with him’ “Sitting in the House of Lords, it’s pretty different to the Commons – the Commons is younger, more testosterone fuelled, toxic masculinity is much more of a problem there. It’s as bad now as it’s ever been, and when I was around it as a campaigner and a lobbyist, it was pretty awful. “The example that really sticks in my mind is when I was working with David Davis on something, and nobody could believe that this macho Tory bloke and female human rights campaigner would find common cause. And so it became, ‘well, he’s under her spell – Helen of Troy’. New Labour’s spin doctors put it about that I must be having an affair with him. There were lobby journalists so disgusted by it that they broke the normal convention and told me it was coming from No 10.” “There’s an army of these boys who look up to Johnson as this jolly marvellous Oxford Union bruiser, and Rayner’s a younger working-class woman with the audacity to face him across the chamber – they probably think she should be facing him across a bar. If she was a bit dowdier she might not get it – or maybe they’d just say debating with her was like being handbagged by the school mistress. You cannot win, and that’s what they want.” Baroness Chakrabarti is a Labour peer in the House of Lords Alison McGovern: ‘90% of time in Brexit debates was taken by men’ “What did I think when I read it? It’s probably not printable. This nonsense is there in some form all the time. But there are big issues at stake. I remember a story saying that during the Brexit debates, 90% of time was taken by men. So yes, you do need to deal with the nonsense – but it’s the substantive stuff that really needs to change. “I don’t know whether it will. Women have been in the House of Commons for more than 100 years and this stuff has always gone on. I do think in some subconscious way, it is supposed to put us off. But women have shown no sign of being put off, and every sign of being determined to be heard.” Alison McGovern is the Labour MP for Wirral South Kim Leadbeater: ‘Am I being treated differently? Am I imagining this?’ “I’ve only been here 10 months, but here are two examples I can give you. One was in a meeting with a male MP and a few other people in the room as well, including one of my male staff members. And the MP spoke more comfortably to my male staff member than he did to me. Now I can’t prove that that was because I’m a woman, but it certainly felt like it. And there was a meeting I was in about football, and I felt quite invisible. I felt like my view was not going to be considered as important as the boys in the room. “So you do question yourself – am I being treated differently? Am I imagining this? “Sadly, I wasn’t hugely surprised by the story. You see this stuff all the time. It is often women that bear the brunt of it, and certainly people from ethnic minority backgrounds, and there’s a class issue here too. The rubbish Angela’s been getting about her working-class background, it’s outrageous. People say ‘we want to have normal people in politics’, and then they get normal people and all they do is berate them.” Kim Leadbeater is the Labour MP for Batley and Spen Tulip Siddiq: ‘What about the young woman on her first day in parliament?’ “It was pretty hard even to read the story, I felt so disgusted by it. I know Angela Rayner very well: I know something like this will throw her off her stride for 30 seconds, and then she’ll be back on it, because she’s made of grit. But what about the young, inexperienced woman of colour working in a very powerful minister’s office? Who then has an inappropriate conversation in the lift with a senior MP she knows? Who thinks her word will not be believed against his because that’s how the imbalance of power is in Westminster? “I worked in parliament for years before I became an MP, and I think what really strikes me is the difference in the way I was treated then. There’s been misogyny since, too, obviously, but nothing to the way male MPs treated me before. “This isn’t a one-off. I hope that everyone who thinks it was unacceptable will react the same when they find out something about their male friends in the party, or the fellow MP that they’re hanging out with and his researcher. I keep getting asked: what have you experienced? And I’m always saying – actually, I felt a lot worse when I didn’t have the title next to my name.” Tulip Siddiq is the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn Samanth Subramanian’s long read on the lost Jews of Nigeria unravels an extraordinary mystery - and has so much to say about how identity is constructed by race, religion and conquest.

4/26/2022,"The UK is gripped by the worst cost of living emergency since the 1980s, with inflation hitting 7% – and threatening to breach 9% – driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and supply chain disruption during the pandemic. In signs of the seriousness of the crisis, energy company chief executives intervened recently to demand MPs offer households more support – with the E.ON boss warning up to 40% of people in Britain could fall into fuel poverty after Ofgem raises the energy price cap again in October. Three people speak about how they’re affected. Andy Mercer, 54, a self-employed painter and decorator based in Abergele, north Wales For Andy Mercer, inflationary pressures mean that after 10 years of running his own business, he’s now considering closing it down. “It hurts to think about it, I’d be a broken man,” he said. Daily staples have jumped in recent months, he said, like some brands of white matt paint rising almost 15% for a 10-litre pot, from about £35 to £40. “It’s putting a huge strain on my business,” he added, eating into earnings “to a point that maybe I’d be better off claiming benefits”. Living in Abergele, north Wales, means Mercer drives to jobs. This month he’s been commuting about 100 miles a day to Porthmadog. From spending about £40 a week on fuel in June last year, Mercer is now often paying £90 a week. Mercer can feel the impact. “We stopped using the oven the moment they hiked the [energy] price up,” he said. “All the food we bought for the oven” – things such as frozen potatoes and yorkshire puddings from Iceland – “we’re thinking of giving it to the food bank as we just can’t afford it”. Stretched finances have even forced Mercer to put his wedding plans on hold. The couple are cutting back in all sorts of ways. “We had this talk yesterday, I said: ‘We’re gonna have to limit a lot more.’ She joked: ‘Well, I’m a nurse, I need my prosecco after the end of a long shift.’” Mercer feels abandoned by politicians. Government inaction means “the UK is turning into a cruel place to live”, he said. And Mercer feels Labour offers a weak alternative. “They’re supposed to be the party of workers, but they’ve picked up too many bad habits from the Conservatives.” Charlotte Armstrong, 47, frontline support worker in Ipswich, Suffolk Over winter, returning from her frontline support job in Ipswich, Charlotte Armstrong would wrap herself in sometimes four or five layers. “The warmest clothes I possibly can, dressing gown, everything,” said Armstrong. “Even if we’re sitting eating our dinner, we’ll have blankets on us.” Armstrong’s private rental home was cold and expensive to heat – windows mostly single-glazed, chimneys unblocked, low energy rating – even before April’s energy price cap hike. The 47-year-old’s electricity rates are climbing 41% from 20.52p to 28.99p a kilowatt hour, her bills show, with gas rates rocketing 85% from 3.99p to 7.37p a kWh. With higher standing rate charges for both, Armstrong’s supplier estimates she’ll pay £1,030.99 more a year. “It’s swallowing our money,” she said. “It’s one of the hardest periods of my life … How do you allocate for that when you’re living close to the bone anyway?” At work, Armstrong often refers families to food banks. “We’re literally in the same place, I feel like we’re all being levelled, pushed down,” she said. “We’re being oppressed economically.” Armstrong bought a plug-in heater to cut gas usage. It follows her room to room. “It makes me feel really angry,” she said. Armstrong urged Sunak to increase the minimum wage, boost universal credit and take on private-sector landlords. She added: “They know exactly what’s going on, but they just don’t care.” Sandy Cameron, 52, living in a trailer in Berkshire Sandy Cameron gets her gas a little differently from most people – living in a trailer in Berkshire with her two children, 18 and 23, she’s off-grid, and instead buys red canisters to power her home’s boiler and gas hob. In recent months, canister costs have surged 45% from £107 in May 2021 to £155 in March 2022 for 47kg of propane. “My money doesn’t last the month,” said the 52-year-old, who works in the agriculture sector. “It’s deflating, I’m not a materialistic person but there’s no money left to do anything.” The family is cutting back to adapt. For Easter, they ate toast for breakfast and rice with broccoli and cauliflower for lunch. “It was nice, but in previous years I’ve had a vegetarian nut roast for myself – with stuffing and roast potatoes – and bought chicken for my sons.” An August getaway with her partner was cancelled. “It’s the little things,” Cameron said. She’s stopped attending £12 yoga classes. “My cat Pumpkin’s the only one not affected, she’s such a fussy eater.” The cat still gets luxury-branded food – but Cameron has noticed that cat-food prices have risen 7.5% from £3.49 to £3.75. “Pumpkin’s going to have to do a little bit of hunting,” she joked. For Cameron, reading about the scale of energy company salaries – the BP chief executive’s pay climbed to nearly £4.5m in 2021 – angers her. “They’re greedy money-grubbing companies, they don’t need that much money,” she said. “Especially when customers are genuinely freezing.”",News/Business,‘We stopped using the oven as price went up’: how rise in energy bills is hitting UK homes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/we-stopped-using-the-oven-as-price-went-up-how-rise-in-energy-bills-is-hitting-uk-homes
4/26/2022,"It’s a position that most businesses would love to find themselves in: booming demand for their products. But soaring requests for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) among British women going through menopause have seen some manufacturers fail to keep up, leading to months of supply shortages and stories of women struggling to sleep or work effectively after being unable to obtain their prescriptions. Several HRT drug providers describe it as the ‘Davina effect’: the documentary Davina McCall: Sex, Myths and the Menopause, fronted by the TV presenter, which was first broadcast on Channel 4 in May 2021, sparking an immediate surge in demand. Yet almost a year later, this shows no signs of abating. Demand for HRT products surged by 30% in the month after the broadcast, according to Theramex, a global pharmaceutical company focused on women’s health. Orders continued to grow through the year, climbing by 130% during the second half of 2021, according to Tina Backhouse, UK country manager for women’s health at Theramex. Millions of women go through the menopause each year, and many experience a range of symptoms, which can be severe, including anxiety, low mood, hot flushes and difficulties sleeping. “As an industry we didn’t have any warning of [the documentary],” Backhouse said. Theramex subsequently increased manufacturing of its HRT products, which are made in Germany, but this is continually under review. “Every month we are looking at it and putting it up again. I thought at the worst we’d have nine to 12 months of safety stock in the warehouse and that is not the case. But we are bringing in enough.” However, the company, owned by private equity firms PAI Partners and Carlyle, said ramping up production has required significant investment, so has not immediately led to higher profits. “It is expensive to increase production capacity. You’ve got to take a leap of faith,” Backhouse added. “It’s not like ordering a load of groceries for next week, [the manufacturers] have to source raw materials.” HRT shortages in previous years have been blamed on manufacturing and supply chain problems, however the industry says lack of availability in recent months stems from growing numbers of women requesting the products. The number of prescriptions for HRT in England has doubled in the past five years to more than 500,000 a month. As a result, some products have not been available for periods of time. Earlier in April, the British Menopause Society warned members and doctors of noticeable ongoing shortages of Oestrogel, a gel that contains the hormone oestrogen and is applied to the skin. Its manufacturer, Besins Healthcare, said it had been experiencing “continuing extraordinary demand” for the gel in the UK. The privately owned, Brussels-headquartered firm said in a statement it regretted “the continuing situation regarding insufficient supplies of Oestrogel into the UK”. Despite delivering almost double the amount of the gel – which is produced in France and Belgium – to the UK between January and April, compared with the same period in 2021, the company acknowledged supplies were sometimes “insufficient”. “Besins are acutely aware of the impact this situation is having on patients and understand that they are worried about fulfilling their prescription,” the company said, advising any concerned patients to speak to their doctor or pharmacist. Besins said it plans to further increase its production, so it can supply more product to the UK in the longer term. HRT gels or patches that are applied to the skin are prescribed more frequently, according to Dr Paula Briggs, chair elect of the British Menopause Society, and a consultant in sexual and reproductive health, because they do not increase the user’s risk of developing blood clots. Although the risk is small, this can be a side-effect of HRT tablets. Producers of HRT rarely join forces because of commercial sensitivities, even at a time of shortages. Some hope the government’s appointment of an ‘HRT tsar’ to tackle lack of availability will bring about more joined-up thinking and collaboration within the industry. “At the moment it feels like menopause management is celebrity-driven, and the clinical focus is not as it should be,” said Briggs. “Whoever is appointed needs to have involvement with national organisations and be in collaboration with the royal colleges.” Briggs is also calling for availability of HRT products to be standardised across the regions and nations of the UK, regardless of whether they are prescribed at GP surgeries or hospitals, to ensure patients can access replacement drugs if their usual prescription isn’t available. HRT producers are not expecting demand to reduce anytime soon. Studies have suggested that between 13% to 14% of UK women are prescribed HRT, despite the fact that an estimated 80% experience some menopausal symptoms. “I think that in the UK lots of very powerful women in politics and the media have all hit menopausal age at the same time and are using their platform to discuss that,” Backhouse said. TV producers have confirmed McCall’s latest documentary on the menopause will be broadcast in early May. HRT suppliers are braced for demand to rocket once again.",News/Society,Manufacturers struggle to keep up with soaring demand for HRT,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/manufacturers-struggle-to-keep-up-with-soaring-demand-for-hrt
4/26/2022,"When I finished Very Cold People, I felt my whole body unclench. In the process of reading this creepy coming-of-age tale, I seemed to have trapped a nerve in my shoulder – it’s that tense. It’s a novel in which nothing very much happens for about 100 pages but small objects – Barbie dolls, Girl Scout sashes, bubble gum, nail polish, a knitted scarf – assume vast significance, and small kindnesses feel overwhelming. When a friend tips candy into the hand of the narrator, Ruthie, she says: “I couldn’t believe how much she was giving me. Just giving it to me, when she could have eaten it herself.” Any act of generosity feels too good to be true. The author of this chilling tale is debut novelist Sarah Manguso, 48, who tried for 20 years to capture the culture of the icy, all-white Massachusetts town of her 1980s childhood in nonfiction, before finally arriving at the spare, elliptical form she uses here. Once home to the wealthiest New England families, the fictional town of Waitsfield has emptied out over the years and yet its residents, with their Mayflower ancestors, are still obsessed with social class. It’s a place of “emotional poverty”, Manguso has said in an interview – a place where “in all of its coldnesses and silences, [it] is ideally set up to protect abusers”. Although the abuse isn’t explicitly stated until the final chapters, the novel is full of foreboding from the first page. “My parents were liars,” says Ruthie in the opening paragraph, ostensibly because they tried to hide their Jewish and Italian heritage from their neighbours. Yet we know, from the tightly coiled anger of those first sentences, that there must be more to it. It unfolds like a much darker version of Roald Dahl’s Matilda – only told at a glacial speed, with no Miss Honey coming to the rescue. Ruthie’s father is a cash-strapped accountant and her mother is a depressed housewife. For much of her girlhood, the family is on the edge of poverty, reliant on trips to the dump for school supplies. But her narcissistic mother has delusions of grandeur. Having brought back a discarded wristwatch catalogue, she irons it and places it just askew on the coffee table “as if someone had been reading it and carelessly put it down”. Ruthie, an only child, carefully (ruthlessly, you could say) catalogues everything she sees and hears, from her mother’s lumpy body in her shiny nightgown to the awkward dinners at the homes of her wealthier school friends. But she doesn’t necessarily understand what she is witnessing. For most of the novel, the story of abuse exists in its omissions, in what is not being said. In one vignette, Ruthie recalls: “We weren’t that young anymore, but Bee’s father still let her sit on his lap like a child and pretend to drive his sports car. When he drove, he steered the wheel with just his thumbs, to show us that he could.” Only years later does Ruthie understand that all the attention she and her friends received from adult men “was tinged with sex”. Upsetting encounters with prying dads, jolly uncles and lecherous gym teachers are brushed off as rare aberrations, helping to maintain the silence around abuse. Manguso trained as a poet but gained attention for her unusual autobiographical nonfiction. Her 2017 book, 300 Arguments, was a collection of extremely short aphoristic essays about desire, writing and relationships. Before that, she published Ongoingness (2015), a meditation on the exhaustive diaries she kept for 25 years. She swore she would never write a novel, partly because she couldn’t imagine being able to create characters or dialogue and partly because she held on to the antiquated idea that a novel had to say something sociological and philosophical. It couldn’t just be the story of one girl. The fragmented, stream-of-consciousness fiction of Sheila Heti and Jenny Offill has clearly helped change the landscape for a writer as skittish as Manguso. Like their novels, Very Cold People is composed of units of writing that are sometimes so short, they feel like wisps of thought. Fans of Gwendoline Riley and Catherine Lacey’s unconventional stories about family and community dysfunction are also likely to appreciate Manguso’s pitiless, minutely observed prose. But Very Cold People is so different from anything else I’ve read that it feels a bit fatuous to compare it to other works of fiction. We often talk about writers getting under the skin of their characters, but Manguso has a forensic interest in hair follicles, rashes, effluvia and infected cuts. By writing about these girls’ relationships with their bodies, she picks at the scab of generational trauma and shame. It’s a masterclass in unease. I must confess that I was relieved when the novel was over but it was so skilful, so strange and so unique that I suspect it will stay with me for a very long time.

On 11 April the Federal Aviation Administration concluded its investigation into the incident and determined that Jacob had crashed his plane as a stunt, saying, “On November 24, 2021, you demonstrated a lack of care, judgment, and responsibility by choosing to jump out of an aircraft solely so you could record the footage of the crash.” The FAA justified its conclusion by pointing out the fact that Jacob had attached multiple cameras to the outside of his plane, including a camera pointed in the direction of the propeller “in order to record video footage of the outside and inside of the plane during the flight.” Other pieces of evidence the FAA cited included the sport parachute backpack container that Jacob put on before the flight, his opening the left side pilot door before claiming that the engine had failed, his failure to contact air traffic control on the emergency frequency before jumping out the plane and his lack of attempts to restart the engine by increasing airflow over the propeller. The FAA also said that Jacob did not make any attempts to search for safe areas to land, even though “there were multiple within gliding range” in which he could have made a safe landing, and that he jumped out of the plane while holding a camera attached to a selfie stick and continued to record the plane during his descent. Additionally, the agency found that Jacob had recovered then disposed of the plane wreckage, as well as recovered the cameras that he had attached to the plane before the flight. As a result of its findings, the FAA has revoked Jacob’s pilot license and informed him in a six-page letter that if “you fail to surrender your certificates immediately, you will be subject to further legal enforcement action, including a civil penalty of up to $1,644.00, for each day you fail to surrender it”. In response to the letter, Jacob posted a video on YouTube on Saturday, saying, “I didn’t think that just posting a video of an adventure gone south would ruffle so many feathers.” “The aviation community has been pretty tough on me, so I’m thinking about quitting altogether and giving up, just because I’m hated,” he added, while filming himself on his way to the post office to mail his pilot’s license. According to the letter, Jacob is not allowed to reapply for his pilot license for a year.",News/Technology,"YouTuber deliberately crashed his own plane for views, US aviation agency says",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/26/youtuber-deliberately-crashed-plane-for-views-faa

I had £24,336 in my Zopa Isa, so I instructed Charter Savings to take it over. It sent the required transfer request to Zopa on 31 January. I heard nothing until Zopa emailed on 1 March stating it aimed to process the requested transfer in the next 30 days. I’ve heard nothing since. I emailed its complaints department on 1, 4 and 8 April but have received no replies. Whenever I phone and ask for “Isa” it says it is too busy and cuts me off. Today I rang again and spoke to someone by asking for “investments” who rang the Isas department. He was told they would ring him back and then he would phone me, but gave me no timescale. Still nothing. Charter Savings says there is nothing more it can do until Zopa transfers my Isa.

4/26/2022,"Britain’s computerised army recruitment system has been closed for most of the war in Ukraine after candidate data was compromised in a possible hack, prompting alarmed officials to suspend its operations. The enrolment portal has been offline since mid-March, when it was shut as a precaution when data relating to an estimated 120 army recruits was discovered being offered for sale on the dark web. Defence sources said they would not comment on whether Russia or Russian actors were involved, although there is a suggestion it was a low-level compromise because it was unclear if there had been a hack or if someone had simply obtained a screen grab or print out. A British army spokesperson said: “Following the compromise of a small selection of recruit data, the army’s online recruitment services were temporarily suspended pending an investigation. “This investigation has now concluded allowing some functionality to be restored and applications to be processed.” Hacking of soldiers’ details has been a feature of the war in Ukraine, with hacker group Anonymous claiming to have released personal details of 120,000 Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine in early April. The internal Defence Recruitment System has now been restored, the army said, after a lengthy investigation, but the external online portal remains down and the problem has complicated army recruitment for over five weeks of the two-month war in Ukraine. Emergency systems have been used to handle candidate recruitment. Those visiting the army recruitment login page were being told “we are currently experiencing some technical issues” and candidates wanting to be updated had to call a dedicated number if they had “any questions surrounding your application”. Conflicts often act as a spur to military recruitment and while Britain is not fighting in the war in Ukraine, there has been increased British army deployment in Poland and Estonia – demonstrating the need for a steady stream of recruits. Recruitment has been handled jointly by outsourcing group Capita and the British army since 2012. But performance has been mixed: targets were missed in six years out of eight and the army remained below its 82,050 official requirement. Last year the target was dropped to 72,500 by 2025. The Information Commissioner’s Office, responsible for data protection, said it had been informed of the incident. But a spokesperson told the Guardian that “after making inquiries and carefully reviewing the information provided, we decided no further action was needed at this time”. It is not yet clear what impact the compromise and shutdown will have on recruitment numbers.",News/UK news,UK’s army recruitment system closed since March after data breach,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/uks-army-recruitment-system-closed-since-march-after-data-breach
4/26/2022,"With the local elections looming, there’s a ward in the borough next to mine that is apparently Labour’s No 1 target. “Win this ward,” said a text-plea for canvassers, “and we see the 50-year rule of the Tories next door end.” Obviously, I’d have signed up straight away, except that ward is the borough I grew up in, and I feel moderately confident that I and my ilk made it even more Tory by canvassing there in the first place. In the 80s, I used to go door to door with my mother. I honestly don’t know if anyone undecided has ever, genuinely, had their mind changed by a party member arriving with a rosette, but I can say with moderate certainty that there is nothing more annoying than being canvassed by a kid from the opposite side, even one accompanied by an adult. Torn between wanting to be rude, and not wanting to be seen as the kind of person who would be rude to a child, Conservative voters would wave us off through a door opened no more than an inch, saying: “True blue, I’m afraid.” Granted, I have no data on this, but the vibe was very much: “You’ve made me 10 times more Conservative than I was five minutes ago.” For a brief period just before 1997, there was an air of inevitability around a Labour victory, and then canvassing was more like being an employee from the council, standing in a shopping centre with a questionnaire of the bleeding obvious: “Would you like better air quality, or worse?”; “Do you think the future should be brighter, or less bright?” Still, in this pocket of south London, the Conservatives held the council. There followed a few years when people just wouldn’t answer the door, the citizenry having finally woken up to the fact that, if you aren’t expecting anyone, it’s either going to be a canvasser or someone selling you a cleaning product. Now, of course, everyone answers because they are waiting for an Amazon package, so their first experience of the political interaction is disappointment that you’re not the speciality lightbulb they have been waiting for. The main purpose of talking to people on the doorstep, now, is for canvassers to be able to parlay what they heard into a point that begins: “What I’m hearing on the doorstep …” Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"Helping Mum canvass for Labour in the 80s, I think I actually turned people Tory | Zoe Williams",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/26/canvass-labour-80s-tory-door-to-door-voters-amazon-local-elections
4/26/2022,"Last summer, a young man – let’s call him Daniel – walked into a hospital A&E department in England and told doctors that he suffered from schizophrenia. He had struggled with his mental health for years, and now he wanted help. But after he was briefly seen by an early intervention team, he was discharged. A few days later, he stabbed a stranger whom he deemed to be a threat to his life, and now he’s locked away in a prison cell. “I’m devastated for him,” his mother tells me, “and concerned for others in similar situations.” This is not a broadside against the NHS’s overworked and underpaid army of staff, who overwhelmingly do their best in unnecessarily challenging circumstances. It is instead a plea for attention to solve one of the great under-discussed crises of modern Britain: the mental distress that blights the lives of millions of citizens, and the lack of provision to tackle it. According to the charity Mind, there are not just 1.6 million people languishing on mental health waiting lists, there are another 8 million who would benefit from treatment, but can’t make it on to those oversubscribed waiting lists because of high eligibility thresholds. The Guardian recently revealed that the NHS in England is paying £2bn a year to private hospitals to care for mental health patients because of the lack of its own beds – another striking example of lights flashing red on the dashboard. For those who shrug their shoulders, believing the use of the private sector is just a pragmatic solution to help those in need, consider the fact that one in four non-NHS psychiatric facilities have been judged “inadequate” by Care Quality Commission inspections. “If taxpayers’ money is being spent on poor-quality care in some cases,” says Mind’s head of policy, Vicki Nash, referring to recent deaths in private mental health services, “we need to ask ourselves: is that money better spent elsewhere?” Our rulers will undoubtedly rebut these criticisms. After all, the Tory-led coalition government announced that mental health would be granted parity of esteem with physical healthcare more than a decade ago, and more investment has been ploughed into the sector, including £500m last year in response to the pandemic. As the King’s Fund thinktank has argued, while demanding parity of esteem is useful – not least in a country in which suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 – it needs to be matched with adequate funding and better joined-up working between different NHS services. What we do know is increased investment has been offset by surging need. Calls to the helpline of anti-suicide charity Campaign Against Living Miserably, for instance, surged by 40% when the pandemic began, while there has been a 100% increase in the number of 16- to-24-year-olds accessing its website. The trauma unleashed by the pandemic and the drastic measures needed to contain it cannot be understated: according to the World Health Organization, cases of anxiety and depression jumped by a quarter across the globe in the first year alone. The testimonies of those working in crisis-ridden mental health services tell their own story. One mental health professional with decades of experience tells me: “It is now at the worst point I can remember due to a staffing crisis that has been a problem for well over five years now, and probably closer to 10 years.” Staffing issues had led them to start locking up patients at night, they tell me, and while a new unit being built should be a cause for celebration, it causes them dread, since staff are leaving in droves. Another worker tells me of a child patient with a history of being abused who fell off a waiting list because their working mother had missed a call from mental health services. One of their female patients who suffered abuse from her parents and then partners has suicidal tendencies, they say, but waiting lists mean having to wait months to get an assessment, and then another 18 months before getting help. One mother of a suicidal teenage boy was made to put in a referral to child and adolescent mental health services in writing, told there would be two weeks until an urgent appointment was possible, and felt there was no choice but to take him to a chaotically busy A&E department. “My son feels his life isn’t worth bothering with, and feels even more hopeless,” she tells me. If you speak to anyone who has been through our struggling mental health system, you’ll hear the term “waiting lists” comes up again and again. Why do we put up with such chronic and systemic failures, many of which undoubtedly lead not just to unnecessarily prolonged misery, but in all too many cases loss of life? Perhaps the sheer number of crises afflicting modern Britain is crowding out the space to talk about it. Whatever the answer, avoidable misery is imposed on the lives of millions because of a recurring failure to match need with provision – and the human cost is incalculable.

4/26/2022,"For the first time in an Australian election we’re able to see exactly where the political parties are targeting some of their ads. In previous elections we’ve had to piece together an incomplete picture from fragments of ad targeting sent to us by individuals, or hack together databases of political ads by scraping Facebook. Transparency in election advertising is important – collecting and maintaining such an ad database is what allowed us to cover the mediscare campaign in such depth, and reveal how the Coalition was using Facebook ad targeting for its “war on the weekend” campaign. Now, thanks to data buried within Google’s political transparency report, and with a bit of technical wrangling, we can see where they are pitching their digital campaigns in close to real-time – right down to the postcode. I’ve written some code that takes the records of Google and YouTube advertising, then converts the geotargeting data into electorates based on the proportion of the electorate’s population covered. This data includes any ads run by a “verified election advertiser” shown on YouTube and Google’s display ad network – so the various text, video and image ads that follow you around the broader internet. We’ve previously used this to see where the Labor party was targeting its early campaign advertising, but until recently there wasn’t much to see from the federal Liberal party. That changed on the day before the election campaign was called, when the Liberal party released a slick advertisement titled Scott Morrison: Why I love Australia on YouTube. In the video, soundtracked with emotive orchestral music, Morrison talks about the various disasters that have hit Australia and credits the government’s handling of the pandemic for saving 40,000 lives from Covid. Here, we can see exactly which electorates were targeted with ads showing this video: You can use the dropdown on the map to show the targeting of all video ads since the start of the campaign – the Liberal party has added a video ad depicting Anthony Albanese as a weathervane to its roster, and ads spruiking Australia’s economic recovery. This map and the following charts shows the number of unique ads shown to an area – that is, if an electorate had been targeted with both Why I love Australia and the weathervane video, it would have a score of two. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning This does not measure the amount of times an ad has been shown nor the ad spend, which is difficult to estimate for each electorate based on Google’s data. The electorates covered are mostly, as you would expect, marginal – or close to – with a focus on the same seats that have been also been a focus of leader campaigning and election announcements – places such as Gilmore on the New South Wales south coast, Bass and Braddon in Tasmania, and a large number of marginal Queensland electorates. Notably absent are the seats in which Liberal party politicians are competing against the so-called teal independents, such as Wentworth, Goldstein and Kooyong. The federal Labor party is targeting similar electorates, with some differences, with the most number of unique video ads being shown in the Western Australian battleground seats of Hasluck, Swan and Pearce and the same marginal Tasmanian seats. Here you can compare the places both parties are targeting – again, this is only the federal branches of each party. Including the state branches is possible but skews the data towards particularly active states. And, because I know people will ask, here’s where Clive Palmer’s United Australia party is targeting its advertising: This won’t be surprising to anyone who has watched TV, walked outside or been anywhere on the internet – Palmer is targeting his ads mostly indiscriminately, and has so far spent at least $14.2m on Google and YouTube ads, many of which are targeted to the entire country or specific states. He is, however, running one particular campaign which targets specific electorates – this video promising a 20% tax break for people in regional areas is being shown only to those in regional electorates.

4/26/2022,"He was praised as a positive role model. He enjoyed the admiration and respect of his superiors and was given special privileges. His elite unit came to be seen by senior commanders as “a bulwark against chaos”. Police Sgt Wayne Jenkins is now serving a prison sentence until January 2039. Jenkins’ name appears in the opening shot of We Own This City, an HBO drama that chronicles the rise and fall of the Baltimore police department’s gun trace taskforce (GTTF), described in an independent report as “the most shocking corruption scandal in Baltimore’s history”. The series was shot in Baltimore and brings together several alumni of the The Wire, both on screen and behind the camera, including David Simon and George Pelecanos. But unlike that venerated saga, We Own This City is based on the true story told in the journalist Justin Fenton’s nonfiction book of the same name. It tells how a shift in policing strategy in 2007 led to the creation of the GTTF amid concern that police had spent too long pursuing drugs rather than guns. Fenton writes that the police commissioner Frederick Bealefield insisted that police were not going after everyone in Baltimore any more, just “bad guys with guns”. Fenton explains in a phone interview from Baltimore: “It started as a way to try to do more sophisticated gun trafficking cases. The Baltimore police department, recognising that the problem was perhaps guns more than drugs, wanted to have a smarter approach. It wasn’t a very large initiative, just a handful of officers, a single unit, and they went about their work with little fanfare. “Over the years, as I describe in the book, it lost that focus and was just another unit of plainclothes officers running around the city. They didn’t trot these guys out for press conferences. It wasn’t that we heard about them all the time. They were working in the shadows, and deployed by the police department as another tool to roam the streets looking for guns.” This low profile helped insulate the GTTF from public scrutiny – and allowed it go rogue. For years its plainclothes officers went on a a crime spree that included robbing people they stopped on the streets, planting drugs and guns on innocent people, invading people’s homes and stealing from them as well as fraudulently charging the city for working overtime. Fenton, who worked as a consultant on the six-episode TV drama, says: “It really is just absolutely staggering. It spans dozens if not hundreds of incidents under our noses and there’s reasons for that which I try to explain in the book. “There’s been so much rightful attention on police brutality and so we know when an officer shoots somebody there’s an injury, there’s a death. But this type of casual everyday lying, stealing, misrepresenting information, in some cases framing people – it’s hard to prove and for that reason it often went unaddressed.” The misconduct continued despite the outcry over Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African American man who died of neck injuries suffered in police custody in April 2015. Fenton commented: “Every official’s talking about reform, reform, reform and you think that all eyes are on the police department and everybody’s behaving their best and yet this is going on. It’s remarkable.” But the GTTF’s reign of impunity was cut short when a suburban drug investigation happened to reveal one officer’s contacts with a drug organisation. This prompted an FBI wiretap – somewhat evocative of The Wire. In March 2017, eight members of the GTTF were indicted and arrested on federal charges of robbery, extortion, overtime fraud and selling drugs seized during police operations. Fenton comments: “We have years and years of lawsuits, of complaints, of opportunities to catch them and it was this suburban drug investigation that led to them getting caught. I think investigators fell ass-backwards into this case. You get a guy on a wiretap talking to drug dealers about drugs and then you just keep pulling that string.” Six of the eight arrested pleaded guilty to the charges. Four of them agreed to cooperate with the justice department and testified against the remaining two officers, both of whom were convicted by a jury in February 2018. The convicted officers were sentenced to prison terms ranging from seven to 25 years. Fenton, who reported on the trial, recalls: “Through the people cooperating and telling the truth, we gained a new level of understanding of how these things work that I don’t think we’ve had previously. They told us not just what they did but how and that was very eye-opening testimony. It’s like someone describing how they first stole money. “In the case of [the detective] Maurice Ward, he said it was an accident: he didn’t turn in drugs and he realised that nobody asked him about it and then he sees other people around him skimming money and it’s like, ‘Wow, we can do this and nothing’s going to happen.’ And it just escalates from there.” Sgt Wayne Jenkins was the ringleader and is the central protagonist of the book and TV series. He was born in 1980 which, Fenton notes, means that Baltimore has been shrinking and struggling for most of his life. Jenkins followed in his father’s footsteps by joining the Marines but happened to leave with an honourable discharge just a month before the September 11 terrorist attacks. He became a police cadet in 2003, married and bought a house. Fenton has spoken to many people in Jenkins’ orbit and made multiple attempts to contact Jenkins in prison but without success. He says: “He was regarded well within the police department as someone who was good at his job, who had this eye for driving down the street and seeing somebody make a movement and it turns out that person has a gun. And he’s the worst officer doing the worst things.” In April 2010, for example, Jenkins was involved in a reckless car chase that led to the death of an innocent motorist. He and members of the GTTF framed the two men that Jenkins had been pursuing by planting drug evidence. The two men were sent to prison for crimes they did not commit. Jenkins duly tested his colleagues’ willingness to put personal loyalty to him above their oaths to uphold the law. Det James Kostoplis testified that, soon after joining the GTTF, he was asked by Jenkins to go for a ride. They drove a short distance to a side street where Jenkins told Kostoplis to leave his phone and equipment in the van and get out. Jenkins then asked Kostoplis what he thought about investigating a high-level drug dealer, determining where he kept his money and stealing it. Kostoplis replied: “No. That’s a terrible fucking idea. You know, you can’t have a badge on your chest and do things like that.’ Kostoplis was transferred out of the GTTF soon after. Bringing Jenkins and his ilk to justice does not mean Baltimore’s problems are resolved. As of late March, 76 people had been murdered so far this year, up from 65 over the same period in 2021. Another 156 people had been injured in shootings, up from 115 in the corresponding period. The city had also recorded 714 robberies, an increase of almost 25%. The GTTF further damaged the already troubled relationship between police and residents of Baltimore, especially communities of colour. The police department is now under federal oversight but the decades-old spectre of corruption lingers. Fenton, 38, who worked for the Baltimore Sun newspaper for 17 years and is now at the Baltimore Banner, a new non-profit newsroom, says: “I do definitely wonder if it happens again, if it’s happening right now, will I know? Will members of the community reach out to us? Will it be reported? “Officers tell me that it’s a new day over there and everybody’s wearing body cameras all the time, which wasn’t the case until pretty late in the investigation of the gun trace taskforce. So you have to think that’s making a difference. “But these challenges continue and I wonder how we will know if the department has fixed itself. How do we measure that, how do we quantify that, especially given the deep-seated bad feelings about this department?” In an act of radical transparency, the Baltimore police department hired an outside investigator to conduct a review. Michael Bromwich, a former US justice department inspector general, and his team conducted a two-year investigation that included more than 160 interviews and examined hundreds of thousands of pages of documents. His report, published in January this year, ran to 515 pages and sought to explain how a scandal of such proportions could begin and continue for years without being detected. It found an extended institutional failure of the police department’s internal affairs along with broad supervisory breakdowns. Bromwich, a senior counsel at the law firm Steptoe, says by phone: “People were promoted without any sense of whether they would be capable of managing people. There was no specific training for supervisors. Supervisors had no incentive to report misconduct by their underlings because, given the culture of the police department, that would put them in a bad odour in the rest of the department.” Crime in Baltimore has been at extraordinarily high levels for decades, he adds, leading to an emphasis on crime fighting and its quantification: numbers of arrests and seizures and other measures. “That produces a culture taken to its extreme, which it was in Baltimore by many, that the ends justify the means,” Bromwich continues. “What are little things like constitutional requirement such as probable cause or reasonable suspicion when Jenkins was quoted as saying that some of the advice he got early in his career was, ‘Never let probable cause stand in the way of a good arrest?’ That says it all, which was the law was a pesky thing that you could ignore if you couldn’t avoid it. “This emphasis on numbers and quantity over quality really had a corrosive effect on the police department and influenced the conduct of officers. Once they realized that the rules that supposedly exist didn’t really exist, it’s a slippery slope into saying, ‘Well, I’m dealing with bad guys and they’ve made a lot of money through dealing drugs or whatever. “‘I’m not victimising real people if I steal some of their ill-gotten gains, so if I go into their homes and I find $100,000, I’ll take $20,000 of it and nobody will be the wiser because these are people who are compromised and they’re not going to complain and, if they do complain, nobody’s going to believe them because they’ve got criminal records.’ “You take that and you multiply it by a large number of officers who get captured by that culture and what you get is the gun trace task force.” We Own This City airs on Mondays on HBO in the US, on Binge and Foxtel Now in Australia, and in the UK at a later date",Arts/Television & radio,‘Absolutely staggering’: the true story behind TV’s buzziest new show,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/25/we-own-this-city-david-simon-show-baltimore
4/26/2022,"When I was covering the bloody conflict in Afghanistan as a journalist, the most credible first-hand knowledge on the ground often came from the local frontline humanitarian workers, but I seldom saw their powerful organisations call a spade a spade about what the warring factions dubbed “collateral damage”. That made me question the whole humanitarian world. Is it comprised of silent rescue and relief entities with no interest or responsibility for holding the perpetrators accountable for the many heinous crimes? After all, they often have the undeniable evidence and moral upper hand of neutrality to expose truth in the otherwise murky settings of war, where the propaganda leads to confusion and false interpretations, potentially resulting in more conflicts. Having high regard for the wonderful work the UN, the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) and all other humanitarian organisations have been doing in Afghanistan after it has been largely abandoned by the international community on the heels of the Taliban takeover, I was confronted with this question again when I read a statement by Unicef on a deadly air raid by Pakistan which killed scores of civilians, mostly sleeping children, in Afghanistan’s Khost and Kunar provinces recently. Unicef’s representative in Afghanistan confirmed in a series of tweets that a total of 20 children were killed during the airstrikes in the early hours of 16 April without once naming the obvious perpetrator. This was an incident where an organisation could have condemned the perpetrator as the de facto authority in Afghanistan, the Taliban, confirmed it as a Pakistani air strike and the Pakistan government owned it as “an incident” in a “counter-terrorism” operation. What kept the UN from speaking on behalf of the 20 children killed while asleep? The first Geneva convention of 1864 laid the foundations for many of the rules governing the mandate of humanitarian actors. Since then we have seen an array of large institutions emerge, such as the UN, the ICRC and many more. Why haven’t they done more to stop the conflicts and tragedies – and could they have done more at all? Have we gone too far in turning humanitarianism into an industry going about its own “market-driven” norms? I am very conscious of the vulnerabilities of the local humanitarian workers caught in the conflict. Although I am very disappointed, I don’t blame Unicef Afghanistan either because on an individual level I’m sure they have “procedures” to follow. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning However, in my view there has to be recognition of the matter and, if needed, a reaffirmed global consensus on the scope and mandate of humanitarianism beyond charity and silent assistance. Speaking up on behalf of the oppressed and persecuted must not be left to some organisation such as Médecins Sans Frontières or Amnesty International, but made an integral part of the whole humanitarian world so no individual or entity is singled out and nobody suffers silently. MSF stood out for its courageous stance in the wake of a deadly US air strike on their health centre in northern Kunduz province. It left no ambiguity about the perpetrator and spoke openly for justice and humanity. Has our collective consciousness reduced to the level where humanitarianism is largely confined to distributing goods branded with the logos of the organisations for a photoshoot, and then taking the images of the vulnerable communities’ miseries to boardroom meetings and international conferences in luxury hotels for raising funds? Would it be too cynical to wonder whether the cycle of humanitarian operations now seems less to revolve around its core principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and more about money and politics? I understand that any humanitarian institution exposing brutalities in conflict zones is often the first to be kicked out and thus depriving the vulnerable population of the first-hand rescue and relief they were providing. Still, I believe we all need to put our hearts and minds to work and reclaim true humanitarianism from becoming too industrialised.  Shadi Khan Saif is an Afghan journalist based in Melbourne.

The message – one of more than 2,000 texts turned over by Meadows to the House select committee investigating January 6 and first reported by CNN – shows that some of Trump’s most ardent allies on Capitol Hill were pressing for Trump to return himself to office even after the Capitol attack. “In our private chat with only Members several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call Marshall [sic] law,” Greene texted on 17 January. “I just wanted you to tell him.

They will destroy our country next.” The message about Trump potentially invoking martial law, earlier reported by CNN on Monday and confirmed by the Guardian, came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election. Meadows did not appear to respond to Greene’s text. But the messages Trump’s top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden’s election win on January 6. Greene – one of Trump’s fiercest far-right defenders on Capitol Hill – also texted Meadows days before the Capitol attack asking about how to prepare for objections to Biden’s win at the joint session of Congress, the text messages show. “Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote on 31 December. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.” That text message from Greene, who had not yet been sworn in as a member of Congress, a week before the Capitol attack also underscores her close relationship with the Trump White House and an extraordinary level of coordination to obstruct Biden being certified as president. But the text messages that Meadows did not turn over to the select committee – as opposed to the communications he agreed to produce for the investigation – were perhaps more notable as the panel investigates connections between the White House and the Capitol attack. The panel is aware, for instance, that Meadows had contacts through December 2020 and January 2021 with organizers of the Save America rally at the Ellipse that descended into the Capitol attack as well as with Trump campaign officials, say sources close to the inquiry. Yet none of the text messages Meadows produced to the select committee through a cooperation deal agreed last year and in response to a subpoena show any such contacts, raising the specter that he might have deliberately withheld some communications. The former White House chief of staff appears to have ultimately turned over no text messages between 9 December and 21 December, a critical time period in the lead-up to the Capitol attack during which a number of key moments took place. Meadows appeared to be aware of efforts by the White House and others, for instance, to send fake Trump slates of electors to Congress. The idea was to have “dueling” slates of electors force then-vice president Mike Pence to discount those votes and return Trump to office. That scheme – which the select committee believes was coordinated in part by the Trump White House, the sources said – appeared to occur on 14 December, the deadline under the Electoral Count Act for states to send electoral college votes to Congress. Meadows also was in close contact with Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani and others after the contentious Oval Office meeting with Trump on 18 December, as he sought to bar onetime Trump campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell from the White House. But Meadows appears to have turned over no text messages from that crucial period, as allies of the former president started to set their sights on January 6, including the Stop the Steal movement that started to plan a protest at the Capitol around that time. The seeming omission may be explained in part by the fact that Meadows was communicating about those plans on his personal cell phone – against which the select committee issued a subpoena contested by Meadows in federal court as “overly broad”. The absence of messages between 9 December and 21 December may also be explained more straightforwardly by the fact that Meadows did not receive any messages during that period. Meadows’ lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. House investigators are not convinced they have been given all the text messages relevant to their subpoena, according to one source with knowledge of the matter, and expect to continue pursuing Meadows’ documents and personal communications in court. In a motion for summary judgment with respect to Meadows’ records, the select committee said in a 248-page court filing late on Friday that it believed Meadows’ claims for withholding material from the investigation on grounds of executive privilege were baseless.",News/US news,Marjorie Taylor Greene texted Trump chief of staff urging martial law to overturn 2020 election,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/26/marjorie-taylor-greene-texts-mark-meadows-martial-law-2020-election
4/26/2022,"One of Twitter’s most controversial users became its owner on Monday, after Elon Musk brokered a $44bn deal to purchase the company. The move was in many ways the culmination of the billionaire’s long history with the platform. Musk has been on Twitter since 2009 and tweeted as early as 2017 expressing interest in buying it. He has also been a vocal critic of Twitter, calling for changes including rolling back content moderation and prioritizing a “societal imperative” of free speech. A prolific user, Musk has 84 million followers on his account – with whom he shares memes, news about his electric vehicle company Tesla and, like the majority of Twitter users, pithy commentary on his day-to-day life. But Musk’s tweets are not all fun and games. The executive has faced major backlash – and in some case legal action – for his activity online. Here are some of the key moments in Musk’s Twitter history. Musk’s activity has in some cases cost him dearly. In August 2018, he posted that he had funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share – a joking reference to marijuana. But the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded after investigation the tweets had no basis in fact and hurt investors, issuing two separate fines to Musk and Tesla of $20m. The penalty marked a “warning for all those who make public pronouncements without regard for either the accuracy or impact of their words”. (Musk maintains that the joke was “worth it”). Part of that 2018 settlement included a clause that Musk would have legal counsel approve tweets about Tesla in advance to ensure they do not contain market-moving news. Musk, unsurprisingly, has not abided by those conditions, flippantly wiping $14bn off Tesla’s value in 2020 with a tweet stating that “Tesla stock price is too high”. Musk again ran into SEC troubles when in 2021 he tweeted a poll about whether to sell his stock and proceeded to do just that. The Tesla CEO and his brother are now under investigation for insider trading relating to whether Musk told his brother in advance that he would tweet the poll. The frequent investigations and legal actions have rankled Musk, whose lawyer said in a legal filing in March that the SEC investigations constitute “outsized efforts calculated to chill [Musk’s] exercise of First Amendment rights”. Musk’s Twitter feuds brought him into a Los Angeles courtroom in 2019, where he faced trial for defamation relating to tweets and other statements he made about the British cave diver Vernon Unsworth. Musk had grown angry after the caver ridiculed him over his plans to rescue a team of young footballers from a cave system in Thailand, baselessly calling Unsworth a “pedo guy” in a tweet to Musk’s then 22 million followers. The Tesla executive later apologized and deleted the tweets after intense criticism from the public and his investors, but re-upped the baseless claims in another series of tweets about a month later and doubled down on them in an on-the-record email to a BuzzFeed reporter. Musk testified in court that he had not meant to be literal in his tweet and that he was upset at the time at what he called “an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids”. “It was wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back,” Musk said. He was ultimately exonerated. Backlash from Musk’s tweets has also come from shareholders. He is being sued in an ongoing lawsuit filed by investors who say his 2018 “420” tweet was inaccurate and hurt the company. Another suit filed by a shareholder in 2021 claims that Musk’s tweets had caused “billions of dollars in losses”, and specifically references a feud between Musk and Senator Elizabeth Warren, which allegedly drove down the stock price another 9.6% in December as well as the poll over whether to sell stock. “Musk remains undeterred and continues to post on Twitter and social media on matters that are material to Tesla and its stockholders, and which ultimately have an impact on Tesla’s stock prices,” the lawsuit says. The platform has also played a large role in Musk’s personal life: he reportedly met his former partner Claire Boucher (known as Grimes) via Twitter. When the couple went public with their relationship in 2018, Page Six reported they met when Musk went to tweet an elaborate pun about artificial intelligence and found Boucher had already made the joke years earlier. The pair, who have since communicated publicly on Twitter often, have two children together. An SEC filing said Musk even made his infamous 420 tweet in 2018 because he “thought his girlfriend ‘would find it funny’.” Even when they are not moving markets, Musk’s tweets are often chaotic and crass (he said he sends them mostly from the toilet). He has received criticism for a number of tweets downplaying the severity of Covid-19 and speaking out against lockdowns. He tweeted (then deleted) a meme comparing the Canada prime minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler over Covid-19 vaccine mandates. Elsewhere over the years, Musk has promised Tesla vehicles would be purchasable in Bitcoin and then walked back that announcement, joked about quitting his job and becoming an influencer, and mused about nuking the planet Mars. Musk’s freewheeling personal style on Twitter has caused many to express concern about his takeover of the company, and whether his “free speech” mentality will translate to harmful policies. “Musk hasn’t just purchased another expensive play toy, but a global online community that includes about 330 million regular users,” said Jessica J González, co-chief executive of media reform advocacy non-profit Free Press. “With control of such a massive platform comes great responsibility – and Musk hasn’t shown he has the capacity to be accountable to this diverse online community.”",News/Technology,Chaotic and crass: a brief timeline of Elon Musk’s history with Twitter,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/25/timeline-elon-musks-history-twitter

4/26/2022,"The number of coal-fired power plants under development around the world fell last year, but far too much coal is still being burned and too many new coal-fired power plants are planned for the world to stay within safe temperature limits. Coal use appeared to be in long-term decline before the Covid-19 pandemic, but lockdowns around the world and economic upheaval drove an increase in new coal projects in 2020, particularly in China. Last year, the total coal power capacity in development fell sharply again, by about 13%, from 525GW to 457GW, a record low for new plants under development, according to a report from Global Energy Monitor published on Tuesday. The number of countries planning new plants also fell, from 41 at the beginning of 2021 to 34 countries. But these encouraging signs were outweighed by a slowdown in older coal-fired power stations being taken out of service. About 25GW of capacity was taken out – roughly equal to the amount of new capacity commissioned in China – and the amount of electricity generated from coal rose by 9% in 2021 to a record high, more than rebounding from a 4% fall in 2020 when Covid first struck. The authors of the report concluded that “coal’s last gasp is not yet in sight”, despite countries agreeing at the Cop26 UN climate summit last November to a “phase down” of coal. Last year, the International Energy Agency warned that no new exploration of fossil fuels of any kind could take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The continuing use of coal comes despite ever starker warnings from scientists in the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which concluded that the world would far exceed the 1.5C limit without rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Flora Champenois of Global Energy Monitor, one of the report’s authors, said: “The coal plant pipeline is shrinking, but there is simply no carbon budget left to be building new coal plants. We need to stop now. The latest IPCC report’s directive for a fighting chance at a livable climate is clear – stop building new coal plants and retire existing ones in the developed world by 2030, and the rest of the world soon after.” The war in Ukraine has also taken a toll, pushing up gas prices and making coal cheaper by comparison, tempting companies and countries to burn more of the dirtiest fuel. But Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, and another co-author of the report, said there could also be an upside in that many countries – particularly in Europe – were looking to reform their energy systems to accelerate clean energy and emphasise energy efficiency. “It’s really important to note how much movement there has been towards clean energy and efficiency in response to the invasion,” he said. Weakening demand in China was also dampening the prospects of a further coal revival, he added. The country’s response to the current resurgence of Covid-19, and to the uncertain global economy, would be crucial. “The question is whether China does go for the high-quality economic growth that the leadership has been talking about.” China has commissioned more new coal-fired power than the rest of the world combined since the Covid-19 pandemic started, but the Chinese government’s plans for increasing clean electricity production by 2025 should mean that less coal is used, even if new coal-fired power plants are built there. But the building of such plants must be controlled much more strictly, according to the report, or growing over-capacity could hurt the country’s transition. Globally, there are still more than 2,400 coal-fired power plants operating in 79 countries, making a total of nearly 2,100 GW of capacity. Only 170 plants are not covered by an eventual phase-out date or carbon-neutrality target, but too few are scheduled to retire in time to stay within 1.5C.",News/Environment,"Too many new coal-fired plants planned for 1.5C climate goal, report concludes",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/26/too-many-new-coal-fired-plants-planned-for-15c-climate-goal-report-concludes
4/26/2022,"Ministers are looking into proposals to make next month’s jubilee bank holiday permanent from next year, amid a campaign by business leaders urging ministers to prioritise public wellbeing over the possible economic costs. Bosses including the Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden and Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of ITV, said the government needed to consider the wider benefits from turning next month’s extra public holiday marking Elizabeth II’s 70-year reign into an annual fixture. Writing to the prime minister and chancellor asking them to back plans for a new public holiday, the business leaders said the government had overestimated the economic costs and not focused enough on the potential societal boost. The Guardian understands the government will be looking carefully at the proposals from the campaign group – which is also backed by figures and trade bodies including the Confederation of British Industry, UKHospitality, the Scouts, the archbishop of Canterbury and the Trades Union Congress – to make this year’s extra break on 3 June into a permanent “thank holiday” from 2023. The addition of an extra bank holiday would bring the annual total in England and Wales to nine, still lower than in EU nations including Germany and France, which have 11 public holidays. Research from the accountancy firm PwC commissioned by the group showed the government’s existing figures overestimate the potential cost of a new bank holiday by 64%, while also failing to account for positive social and health benefits that are not captured by GDP figures. City analysts have warned next month’s platinum jubilee celebrations could trigger a drop in quarterly economic output in the three months to the end of June, increasing the risk of a summer recession as the cost of living crisis forces consumers to rein in their spending. Official figures show extra bank holidays in previous jubilee years have led to sharp reductions in monthly GDP, as the costs from businesses closing for the day were not outweighed by the benefits from higher consumer spending when people had more time for socialising in pubs and restaurants or shopping on the high street. The government estimates this year’s platinum jubilee celebrations will lead to the loss of £2.4bn in economic output. However, the official impact assessment suggests there could be a boost for the hospitality, tourism and retail sectors, while also recognising that there could be benefits for mental health and wellbeing. Prior to the Covid pandemic, the largest monthly declines in GDP were at the time of the Queen’s golden jubilee in 2002, when output fell 2.2%, and 2012 diamond jubilee, when it fell by 1.5%. Meaden said she was backing an extra bank holiday because it could help businesses in sectors of the economy that have struggled during the Covid pandemic. “[It] will provide the country with a social and economic stimulus we need after a difficult few years,” she said. The government has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Ministers to assess proposals for making jubilee bank holiday permanent,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/ministers-to-assess-proposals-for-making-jubilee-bank-holiday-permanent
