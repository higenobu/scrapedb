4/19/2022,"A former SAS patrol commander has told the federal court that no people were found hiding inside a tunnel during a 2009 SAS raid on an Afghan compound called Whiskey 108, contrary to evidence previously given by several soldier witnesses who were on the mission. The retired soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 5, gave evidence on Tuesday that two men shot dead during the operation were noted by troops on the operation as “EKIA” – enemy killed in action – legitimately engaged and lawfully killed. The Whiskey 108 operation, on 12 April 2009, has emerged as a key contest in the defamation trial brought by Victoria Cross winner Roberts-Smith, with the respondent newspapers alleging two prisoners were executed by Australian troops during the mission. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The newspapers allege in their defence that that two men – one elderly, the other a disabled man with a prosthetic leg – were pulled from a hidden tunnel found inside the compound. The defence alleges the elderly man was executed by another soldier on Person 5’s orders, while the disabled man was allegedly executed by Roberts-Smith. The testimony of Person 5 contradicts those claims. Person 5 is the first witness-in-reply called by Roberts-Smith. He said on Tuesday he regards Roberts-Smith as a capable soldier and a “very good friend”. He was Roberts-Smith’s patrol commander on the Whiskey 108 mission in April 2009, when SAS troops were sent in to clear the compound in the village of Kakarak, believed to be an insurgent redoubt and weapons base. Person 5 said he was in the compound when the secret tunnel was found hidden under long cut grass and a grate. Another smaller Australian soldier removed his body armour and carried his pistol into the tunnel to “clear” it, he said. “He was in there no more than a couple of minutes. He then came back, stuck his head out and said it was clear,” Person 5 told the court. Person 5 said that later, as SAS troops worked to secure the compound, “I heard gunshots outside the compound”. “I ran out of the compound … towards where the gunshots were coming from.” He said he reached the outside of the compound in about 15 seconds, where he could see Roberts-Smith and another soldier, Person 4, off the north-west corner of the compound. Person 5 said Roberts-Smith told him “we just engaged two squirters to the north”. “Squirter” was a term used by Australian troops to describe insurgent enemies who tried to flee as Australian troops approached. Person 5 told the court he asked Roberts-Smith Smith: “Are they EKIA (enemy killed in action)? And he said ‘yes’.” Person 5 said he informed the troop commander of “two EKIA off the north-west corner of the compound”. Person 5’s evidence accords with that of Roberts-Smith. In his evidence, Roberts-Smith told the court that there were “no people in the tunnel at Whiskey 108”, and that two men killed during the operation were legitimate enemy targets lawfully engaged and killed in accordance with the laws of war. Roberts-Smith said the man with the prosthetic leg was engaged outside the compound carrying a weapon, and described allegations he had ordered the execution of the elderly man as “completely false”. But it is at variance with earlier evidence from several SAS soldiers called by the newspapers. The court has heard similar – though not identical – evidence from five former and serving SAS soldiers that men were pulled from the tunnel and taken into custody by Australian troops. The newspapers being sued also allege Person 5 and Roberts-Smith were both involved in the death of the elderly man discovered hiding in the tunnel. In the newspapers’ defence, it is alleged that after the Afghan men were pulled out of the tunnel, Roberts-Smith was present when Person 5 ordered another Australian soldier – Person 4 – to execute the elderly man. “Pursuant to that order Person 4 placed [the Afghan man] on his knees and shot him in the back of the head. Person 4 was ordered to execute [the Afghan man] so that he could be ‘blooded’,” the defence document states. The newspapers allege Roberts-Smith “did not say or do anything to encourage Person 5 to withdraw the order or to stop Person 4 following the order”, arguing that he was complicit in, and approved of, the man’s murder. Another SAS soldier, Person 41, has given a slightly differing account of the alleged murder of the elderly Afghan man, alleging it was Roberts-Smith who gave the order he be executed. Person 41 told the court Roberts-Smith and Person 4 asked to borrow the suppressor from his weapon, then said: “RS [Roberts-Smith] walked down and grabbed the Afghan male by the scruff of his shirt.” He said Roberts-Smith walked the man about 2 metres until he was in front of Person 4, “then kicked him in the back of the legs behind the knees until he was kneeling down … RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 ‘shoot him’.” Person 41 said he stepped out of the compound to avoid witnessing the execution: when he stepped back in, Person 4 was standing above the elderly man, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head. In his evidence, Person 5 was asked directly: “Have you ever killed a person who was under confinement?” “Never,” he replied. “Have you ever ordered a member of the Australian Defence Force who was under your command to kill a person under confinement?” “Never.” Person 4 has already given evidence in this trial, spending five days in the witness box. While he gave evidence about other SAS missions he participated in, Person 4 objected to answering questions about his actions at Whiskey 108: “I object on grounds of self-incrimination,” he told the court. After intense legal debate over whether he should be compelled to respond, justice Anthony Besanko ruled he did not have to answer. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One soldier witness, known as Person 24, previously told the court that hours before the Whiskey 108 assault, he saw Person 5 in the SAS headquarters. “Person 5 came to the doorway of our patrol room and he was in a jovial manner, dancing a bit of a jig,” Person 24 said. “He said that we are going to ‘blood the rookie’.” Person 24 said he understood the phrase to mean “they were going to facilitate or put [Person 4] … in a position where he could get a kill under his name”. Under cross-examination he defended his evidence against allegations he was lying and motivated by malice: “I’m compelled here to tell the truth”. Person 5 told the court on Tuesday he had never heard the term “blooding the rookie” until 2018, “just days before I left the SAS”. Person 5 was asked in court: “During 2009, did you ever say to anyone ‘we’re going to blood the rookie’?” “Never,” Person 5 responded. On Tuesday afternoon, Person 5 gave evidence about a fierce daylong firefight at the 2010 Battle of Tizak, and Roberts-Smith awarded the Victoria Cross. He remains in the witness box.

4/19/2022,"Last November, pianist and scholar Dr Samantha Ege gave a recital of works by Florence Price, Margaret Bonds, and Vítězslava Kaprálová at Milton Court Concert Hall. It’s music that’s rarely heard on UK stages, and critics welcomed “the emotional pull to these works” while Ege was praised for her “finely honed performances born of deep study and analysis. What none mentioned, though, was Ege’s outfit. She was radiant in what she described to me as “a muted red fishtail dress, influenced by west African styles.” The bodice was nipped in at the waist with a customised appliqué belt that glimmered under the spotlights, emphasising hints of silver in the large ammonite-like swirls covering the fabric. For Ege, as for many other soloists, her outfits are an important part of her performance. “It gives me even more of an opportunity to express myself”, she says. “I think about colours and moods, and how those will make me and the audience feel.” Her dress, designed by M.A.DKollection, was specifically chosen for this Barbican programme. “Antiquity and modernity … converge in the design, which strongly speaks to the themes in my research and repertoire. I champion piano music from the Black Renaissance, an era that reflected themes of cultural rebirth while paying homage to the past, but with an Afrocentric twist. That very much sums up my relationship to concert attire!” Saxophonist Jess Gillam also has a distinctive concert style, dominated by metallics, striking colour combinations and bold prints. “I love to try and bring a sense of joy to an audience,” Gillam says. “What I am wearing as the performer is part of that.” She picks outfits she feels comfortable and confident wearing. “Most of the music I play is about expressing an emotion or narrative written by somebody else … a level of authenticity is needed to achieve that connection.” Discussing clothing is something of a taboo in classical music, for performers as much as critics. “Most musicians don’t feel like they can talk about it”, says Jocelyn Lightfoot, managing director of the London Chamber Orchestra. Concert dress is contentious for a host of overlapping reasons. There is the entrenched idea that classical musicians are supposed to be heard and not seen – as the 19th-century critic ETA Hoffmann put it: “The genuine artist lives only for the work … He does not make his personality count in any way.” In this performance ideal, the performer’s personality – expressed through his or her choice of clothing – is excised, deferring to “the music itself”. Those musicians who step outside the norm in their clothing choices have, accordingly, been subject to severe criticism – especially when they make any kind of crossover into pop, prompting complaints about “dumbing down”. But at least part of the controversy surrounding artists like violinist Nigel Kennedy, with his jeans and spiky hair, is that they remind us that live music is a visual medium. We don’t just hear – we see musicians performing. For women, the stakes of their clothing choices are considerably higher because women are more frequently sexualised than their male counterparts. While Kennedy’s informal clothes were criticised by some as “ludicrous”, the furore around pianist Yuja Wang betrays this double standard. As much ink has been spilt over Wang’s hemlines as her playing – and with a couple of exceptions, commentary has focused on how “short and tight” her dresses are. The problem isn’t that critics are talking about Wang’s clothes. It’s that by viewing everything she wears through a sexualised lens, they’re presenting her as a sexual object first and an artist second. There is no room in this worldview for women’s clothes to be both an artistic and personal choice. Perhaps part of the issue is that fashion lies outside the traditional classical critic’s toolkit. “That’s right, I’ve turned into a fashion critic,” wrote Norman Lebrecht, who described Wang’s outfit as “a micro-dress cut an inch below the butt.” But this sexualised account couldn’t be further from fashion criticism. It tells us nothing about the dress beyond its length. What were the fabrics? Style? Who was the designer? How did the dress choice interact with the musical programme? The language and skills to address these questions might need to become part of the modern critic’s toolkit – and if critics start taking fashion seriously, agents might be able to include outfit details in press releases without fear that it will open the floodgates to derogatory commentary about the artists they represent. The inability to talk about Wang’s clothing in a sensitive and respectful way reveals damaging and longstanding assumptions around women and their dress on the classical stage. The notion that what we see might “distract from” music, rather than shape our experience of it, stems from a centuries-old division of body and mind, physicality and rationality, that claims classical music as purely cerebral stuff. The body has no place here. And this idea is gendered. Rationality and the mind have historically been coded masculine, sensuality and the body feminine, with the result that women and their bodies have been marginalised within classical music. It’s no coincidence that Hoffmann used “he” as the default for his imagined musician. This policing of women, their clothes and their bodies in the concert hall is nothing new. When the composer and conductor Ruth Gipps turned up to a concert in 1944 wearing a brightly coloured evening dress, she was roundly chastised for it and informed by the orchestral management: “We don’t care for that sort of self-advertisement.” Gipps was first astonished, and then furious. “What sort of place was this,” she asked, “that expected a woman to be ashamed to wear a beautiful dress?” It’s a good question. This narrative needs to change, not least because either sexualising or ignoring women’s clothing diminishes their agency as artists. Wang’s clothing has been dismissed as a triviality, an unconsidered marketing ploy with dresses picked purely for whether or not they “show more leg”. And to do so, Wang has been painted as a naive, lost individual who has “had neither time nor guidance to acquire perspective”, and is consequently being used “as tinsel” by more experienced, expert (male) musicians. The denial of Wang’s agency also feeds into racist stereotypes around the submissiveness and inexpressiveness of both women and classical musicians of Asian descent – stereotypes that Wang’s clothing choices actively disrupt. Wang is one of the most important classical artists performing today, but infantilising performing women is an age-old strategy for diminishing their status and individuality, containing and reducing their potential authority. The 19th-century soprano Jenny Lind, for example, was frequently described as “childlike”. These descriptions are often uncomfortably sexualised, the implication being that such women need some older, stronger man to guide them. We need to find ways of talking about women’s clothes that respect them as artistic choices, and integral to performance. Dress is becoming more important as questions around diversity and inclusion are pushed to the forefront of institutions’ agendas. The London Chamber Orchestra, for example, has recently removed the dress code for its players. Dispensing with the heavily gendered expectations of black tie is partly, Lightfoot says, to celebrate the individuality of the orchestra’s players and build an inclusive space for musicians whose “way of expressing themselves physically doesn’t fit with that classical music stereotype”. But it’s also to create a “mirror between the audience and orchestra”, reaching out to those “who don’t feel welcome in a concert hall”. Moreover, social media has made classical music “so much more visual” says Maxine Kwok, a violinist in the London Symphony Orchestra. Orchestras and soloists alike are now attuned to the branding possibilities it offers, from sharing clips of concerts to photographs of rehearsals in jeans and jumpers. And this can, perhaps, be a way of making musicians more accessible. “There’s always a need to modernise,” and using social media “adds a real human element”, Kwok points out, allowing audiences to engage with the musicians they see and hear on the stage. Musicians are more than the music they create. We evaluate the creative and intellectual decisions that go in to programming – why not clothing as well? Nineteenth-century ideas about what classical music is, who it is by, for and about have all been upended. So, too, must ideas about how it looks.

4/19/2022,"Both conventionally debonair and utterly set apart from the ordinary, Bryan Ferry remains one of the UK’s most singular pop stars. As a book of his lyrics is published on 5 May, new solo music is released and a 50th anniversary Roxy Music tour is prepared, the 76-year-old will join us to answer your questions about anything in his long career, which you can post in the comments section below. The riot of glamour in Roxy Music’s 1972 debut single Virginia Plain, its lyrics written and delivered by Ferry with a circus-master’s sense of theatre, announced a brand new force in British rock. Peacocking but cool rather than silly, Ferry’s invitations to “dance on moonbeams / slide on rainbows / in furs or blue jeans” on Do the Strand, and “just boogaloo a rhapsody divine” on Pyjamarama, were enthusiastically taken up by a fanbase who flocked to their art-school glam. They released eight UK Top 10 albums, eventually modulating into an arena-friendly soft rock band, and reading Ferry’s lyrics on the page from that whole era is a thrill: psychedelic fantasias that are leavened with humour, heartbreak, savage ennui and satirical pokes at the establishment. The band split in 1983 after the No 1 album Avalon, but reformed for their 30th, 40th and now 50th anniversaries – Ferry, along with core members Andy MacKay, Phil Manzanera and Paul Thompson, will play 10 dates in the US in September, and three in the UK in October. Ferry has also long been a celebrated interpreter of others’ songs. His 1973 solo debut These Foolish Things – the first of 16 solo albums – was a covers records that kicked off with Bob Dylan’s A Hard Rain’s Gonna Fall and took in classics like Sympathy for the Devil and The Tracks of My Tears. He later topped the UK charts with Roxy Music’s cover of John Lennon’s Jealous Guy, released the year after Lennon’s murder, and went on to perform Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black, Screamin Jay Hawkins’s I Put a Spell on You, an entire Dylan covers album, and more. A new set of covers are being gradually released this spring: the title track is Love Letters by Ketty Lester, whose River of Salt he previously covered on These Foolish Things; I Just Don’t Know What to Do With Myself, made famous by Dusty Springfield; Elvin Bishop’s waltzing 70s hit Fooled Around and Fell in Love; and The Very Thought of You, a standard beloved of Billie Holiday and Nat King Cole. It’s a rich and ongoing half-century of creativity and indeed impeccable tailoring – post your questions about it below and Ferry will answer as many as he can. His answers will be published in the 29 April edition of the Guardian’s Film & Music section, and online.  Lyrics by Bryan Ferry is published 5 May by Chatto & Windus. Tracks from the digital EP Love Letters are out now or released during April and May.

4/19/2022,"An attempt to bar the far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress over her support for the January 6 attack can proceed, a federal judge said on Monday. Citing “a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import”, Amy Totenberg of the northern district of Georgia sent the challenge on to a state hearing on Friday. A coalition of liberal groups is behind the challenge against the congresswoman, citing the 14th amendment to the US constitution, passed after the civil war. The amendment says: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Supporters of Donald Trump attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, seeking to stop certification of his defeat by Joe Biden. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the riot. Around 800 people have been charged, some with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. He was acquitted when enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal and is free to run again. Organisers of events in Washington on January 6 have tied Greene to their efforts. Greene has denied such links and said she does not encourage violence. In October, however, she told a radio show: “January 6 was just a riot at the Capitol and if you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants.” In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol attack, Greene was one of 147 Republicans in Congress who objected to results in key states, an effort fueled by Trump’s lies about electoral fraud. An effort to use the 14th amendment to bar from Congress Madison Cawthorn, an extremist from North Carolina, was unsuccessful, after a judge ruled an 1872 civil war amnesty law was not merely retroactive. In her ruling on the challenge to Greene on Monday, Totenberg said: “This case involves a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import. Upon a thorough analysis of each of the claims asserted in this case, the court concludes that [Greene] has not carried her burden of persuasion”. Even if a state judge rules against Greene, she could challenge the ruling. The Georgia primary is on 25 May, cutting time short. Greene seems likely to win re-election. Writing for the Guardian, the Georgetown University professor Thomas Zimmer said: “Greene’s position within the Republican party seems secure … in fact, Greene is the poster child of a rising group of rightwing radicals … [not] shy about their intention to purge whatever vestiges of ‘moderate’ conservatism might still exist within the Republican party.” One of the groups behind the challenge to Greene is Free Speech for the People. In January, the group’s legal director, Ron Fein, told the Guardian the group aimed to set “a line that says that just as the framers of the 14th amendment wrote and intended, you can’t take an oath to support the constitution and then facilitate an insurrection against the United States while expecting to pursue public office”. He added: “The insurrection threatened our country’s entire democratic system and putting insurrectionists from any state into the halls of Congress threatens the entire country.” On Monday, Fein told CNN: “We look forward to asking Representative Greene about her involvement [in January 6] under oath.”",News/US news,"Attempt to bar Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress can proceed, judge says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/marjorie-taylor-green-republican-congress-judge-14th-amendment-challenge-georgia
4/19/2022,"Russia has launched its long-anticipated offensive in Ukraine’s east, with Moscow announcing that its forces had carried out one of the largest barrages of strikes since the beginning of the invasion. A total of 1,260 military targets were hit by rockets and artillery overnight along the 300-mile frontline in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions, according to Russian officials, including the strategically important town of Slovyansk and other cities close to the eastern frontline. The attack was anticipated with a video address late on Monday night released by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The battle for the Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time, has begun” he said, adding that “a significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive”. “No matter how many soldiers are driven there, we will defend ourselves. We will fight. We will not give up anything Ukrainian.” A Zelenskiy aide said on Tuesday that the offensive was going “very cautiously” and would fail because Moscow’s forces lacked the strength to break through Ukrainian defences. “Their offensive will fail – I give you a 99% guarantee – they simply do not have enough strength,” said the presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych. So far, according to Ukrainian officials, the frontline in Ukrainian-controlled Donbas is still holding, apart from in the town of Kremina in the northern Luhansk region, which Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov described as a “weak spot”. Russian forces broke through Ukrainian lines into Kremina on Monday and there were reports of street fighting. Moscow’s troops frequently attack Ukrainian positions from all sides, said Zhdanov, and were occupying positions on three sides of the Donbas region: north, east and south. Ukrainian positions along the 2014-22 eastern frontline are the longest established and therefore reportedly some of the strongest. In the northern Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces have recaptured the villages of Bairak and Bobrivka north-east of Kharkiv city, and Hurisivka, another village between Kharkiv city and Izyum, but no other gains have been reported by the Ukrainian army. On Monday, Oleksandr Motuzianyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s ministry of defence, said Izyum was the area with highest concentration of Russian troops. Izyum, regarded for centuries as the gateway to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and, from there, to the Black Sea, fell fully to Russian forces on 1 April, trapping thousands of civilians in a city where as many as 80% of its residential buildings have been destroyed. Moscow is using the city as a launching point for its assault against Ukrainian forces in Donbas, the industrial heartland in the east of the country already partly controlled by pro-Russian separatists. In the south, the mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol alleged that about 40,000 civilians had been forcibly moved to Russia or Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine. “Unfortunately I have to declare that as of today they are forcibly deporting” residents, Vadym Boichenko told Ukrainian television. “We have verified through the municipal register that they have already deported over 40,000 people.” Moscow is edging closer to full control of the city in what would be its biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February. Relentless bombardment and street fighting have left much of the city pulverised, killing at least 21,000 people by Ukrainian estimates. Russia on Tuesday called on Ukrainian forces to “immediately lay down arms” and issued a new ultimatum for the defenders to end their resistance, after Ukrainian forces ignored a previous such ultimatum on Sunday. The fall of Mariupol, the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery, would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia. The town is a large port city and a base for Ukrainian armed forces, and serves as a land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea. If Moscow were to capture Mariupol, it would be the first big city to fall and mark perhaps Russia’s biggest gain of the nearly two-month war.",News/World news,‘The battle for Donbas has begun’: Russia launches offensive in eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/ukraine-war-battle-for-donbas-has-begun-russia-launches-offensive
4/19/2022,"It has had rave reviews for the quality of its writing and acting but for many local people there has been a problem with ITV’s “canoe man” fake death drama: the accents. “Why is it that ITV thinks people from Teesside speak with a geordie accent?” asked one disgruntled viewer. “Insulting!!!!” “The thing about NE accents is they change about 10 times in a 20-mile radius,” said another more forgiving viewer. “I sound different to someone from six miles up the road. They’re so nuanced.” The drama, The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, stars Eddie Marsan and Monica Dolan as canoe man John Darwin and his beleaguered wife, Anne. It tells the true story of one of the most remarkable crime stories of recent years in which Darwin pretends to have perished while out canoeing in the North Sea. It is set in Seaton Carew, a fishing village on the edge of Hartlepool, where the couple lived in an enormous seven-bedroom house overlooking the sea. The social media storm over their accents prompted the drama’s writer, Chris Lang, to defend the actors. “It’s lovely that people are so passionate about their own accents!” he tweeted. “John & Anne of course weren’t from Seaton Carew, they only moved there in 2002. They were both born near Blackhall & over the next five decades lived and worked in (to name a few) Newcastle, Chester Le Street & Durham.” It was a noble gesture but only led to more questions for some. “If they were from Blackhall they’d have had Pitmatic accent,” said Mad Mackem. “Thoo, thow, thy, and the knaws, every village, town and hamlet has a different accent up here. My wife and I are from the same city but have slightly different accents from each other, she’s from north of the river.” It was also confusing for some in that Marsan and Dolan had said in interviews that while filming they spoke to each other exclusively in a Hartlepool accent in order to “sound like a couple who live together, so that they have inflections and tones that are complementary to each other”. The accents of actors is always a sensitive subject. Russell Crowe once walked out of a Radio 4 interview after Mark Lawson suggested his performance in Robin Hood sounded more Irish than Nottingham. “Bollocks,” was Crowe’s response. “You’ve got dead ears, mate. You’ve seriously got dead ears if you think that’s an Irish accent.” Whatever the truth about the accents in The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, at least local residents could enjoy seeing Seaton Carew on screen. “Looks like it was filmed on the Headland rather than Seaton Carew,” one Twitter user pointed out. Yes, replied Lang. “Couldn’t film there for all sorts of reasons.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘Insulting!’: viewers criticise accents in ‘canoe man’ drama,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/19/insulting-viewers-criticise-accents-in-canoe-man-drama

But yes, how encouraging that Amnesia holds itself to a higher standard than No 10. Today marks 1,000 days of Boris Johnson’s premiership, and you have to agree he has truly delivered on his flagship levelling down agenda. Johnson drags everyone to the bottom. In the afternoon on this totemic day, the prime minister will be forced to stand up in the House of Commons – or the Bollocksseum, as his behaviour repeatedly casts it. Here, in the course of spouting some more utter cobblers, he will acknowledge that he has been fined by the police for breaking a law that he not only made himself, but explained the absolutely vital importance of sticking to every night on TV. Meanwhile, a load of Tory MPs will gibber their way across the airwaves to explain that this is no biggie. With the exception of those few backbenchers to have called for the prime minister’s resignation, the hardest line you’ll hear from any other Conservative member of parliament is that they are “waiting to see the local election results”. To which the only possible retort is: why? Why do you need to wait for the public to tell you right from wrong? Don’t you think the public might be a bit busy with matters such as the cost of living crisis to have to explain the absolute basics to a bunch of betas whose job is supposed to include having a clue? Honestly, if you can’t work out that it is beyond a pisstake for the prime minister to make draconian new laws then break them himself, it does feel like your public service mechanism is completely shot. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of it about. People break out the term “gaslit” for everything these days, but this is an occasion where it fits the bill. Contrary to what the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, claimed this morning, this is not like a parking fine, unless we’ve all forgotten the bit where the government cleared the broadcast schedules at 5pm every night to impress on the British people the life-or-death importance of not breaking parking regulations. Last weekend it was reported that Johnson himself had kicked off his adviser Lee Cain’s leaving do by pouring the drinks. Picking back through the archives, it wasn’t so long after this event that HM government unveiled a hard-hitting new ad campaign, one image of which showed a woman being given oxygen as she stared accusingly into the camera. The caption: “Look her in the eyes and tell her you never bend the rules”. What can you say to those defending the government not just bending the rules, but breaking the law? Look us in the eyes and tell us you didn’t tell us to look her in the eyes. Even the cake-assisted birthday gathering in the cabinet room for which Johnson has already been penalised by the Metropolitan police came not long after he had tweeted a letter in which he explained to a seven-year-old girl that she was right to cancel her birthday party. As the PM piously instructed the public in the attendant hashtag: “#BeLikeJosephine”. As has now been revealed, he himself continued to #BeLikeBoris. Speaking of stuff that seven-year-olds have grown out of, we know that Johnson is a big fan of The Lion King, recently quoting the movie’s “change is good” line when several of his closest No 10 staff walked out on him. Put simply, the Conservatives hanging on to Johnson now is like the entire pride hearing what Scar did but keeping him in post anyway. Weirdly, that wasn’t the plot structure Disney went with in the end – and they know a thing or two about popular narratives. Incidentally, any MPs who react to this analogy by inquiring rhetorically “then who and where is Simba?” merely make matters worse. Just go the whole hog and run the local election campaign under the slogan “THERE IS NO SIMBA – THIS IS IT.” MPs who can’t wait to tell you “Boris always brings the house down!” haven’t yet realised that they’ll get buried in the rubble. You don’t need to be an esteemed political historian to work out that politicians defending prime ministerial lawbreaking will be doing something devastating and long-term to trust in the whole of politics. Then again, it does help to be one. On Sunday, the distinguished constitutional sage Peter Hennessy – not exactly given to intemperate public statements – declared of Johnson’s failure to resign for breaking the actual law: “I think we’re in the most severe constitutional crisis involving a prime minister that I can remember.” Describing Johnson as “a rogue prime minister, unworthy of [the Queen]”, Hennessy went on to judge him “the great debaser in modern times of decency in public and political life, and of our constitutional conventions – our very system of government”. As his diary entry for the day Johnson’s police penalty was revealed reads: “I cannot remember a day when I have been more fearful for the wellbeing of the constitution.” Well, give it till the next fine drops. There’ll be another black day along soon enough. And that’s arguably the most genuinely poleaxing bit of the whole story. The prime minister’s defenders have still failed to grasp one of the most essential truths of Johnson’s lifelong practice of behaving badly then lying about it: that there is always, always more to come. Being dismissive about cake in the cabinet room is very obviously going to leave you hostage to fortune if it turns out that Johnson is fined for more serious lawbreaking down the line. Yet his allies are currently sticking to variations of a defence that basically amounts to, “Hey – that birthday party was the least criminal thing he did!” By the time we get to the fallout over who did or didn’t pour the first vat of wine at Caino’s leaving do, Johnson will be forced into some truly batshit contortions. Are you familiar with sovereign citizens? A new breed of conspiracy wingnut who argue that, actually, they can opt out of laws they don’t think should apply to them? No? Then do make sure to bone up on them, because you’re governed by one. In the meantime, consider the sheer amount of time that an entire government and parliamentary party appears willing to spend clearing up after one man. Did they really get into politics to do this? Are they really waiting until the public tells them to stop? It certainly looks like it. Even at this late stage in the game, Conservative MPs remain too wet to wield the knife, preferring instead to grasp the pooper scooper.
