4/14/2022,"While I agree with everything Dr Katherine Henderson says (‘For staff, this is heartbreaking’: senior doctor’s view on crisis in urgent care, 10 April), and particularly the need for long-term workforce planning and an increase in bed capacity, I would add that we need to bring back convalescence homes/hospitals to enable people to be discharged from acute wards. Going straight back home is not the answer even if there is sufficient domiciliary care for those needing it, as time is required for families to get organised with regard to care arrangements. This would also give multidisciplinary teams time to make assessments, as many older people admitted for acute emergency care have complex needs. From my recent experience, an NHS-funded rehabilitation bed in an elderly persons’ care home is not the answer, although it seems to be the current method of dealing with “bed blockers”. The solution offered is to be bedridden in your own home with three visits a day from care workers. Surely we can do better than that in an environment where a holistic approach to assessing someone’s needs occurs and relevant treatment is provided?

4/14/2022,"More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has claimed. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said the bodies of 765 civilians, including 30 children had been found around the capital. A puppy was pulled out alive from the rubble of a shelled building by rescuers with the Donetsk regional police in the Donetsk oblast area: Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/14/2022,"It was said so matter-of-factly. “I thought we outwitted them for long periods until it was 2-0,” said Northern Ireland’s manager Kenny Shiels after his team’s 5-0 defeat by England in front of a sold-out record crowd of 15,348. “We knew exactly what they were going to do before they did it. We spoke about it. I felt they were struggling a wee bit at times to open us up until the psychology of going 2-0 up in the women’s game. I’m sure you will have noticed if you go through the patterns – when a team concedes a goal, they concede a second one in a very, very short space of time, right through the whole spectrum of the women’s game, because girls and women are more emotional than men. So, they take a goal going in not very well. When we went 1-0 down we tried to slow it down to give them time to get that emotional imbalance out of their heads. That’s an issue we have. Not just in Northern Ireland but all of the countries in the world. I shouldn’t have told you that.” The “I shouldn’t have told you that” was not a check on himself, a realisation that he had said something inappropriate and inaccurate, but was said as if he had let the listening journalists in on a trade secret, a tactical nugget that other teams could exploit. It was not a passing comment either, or a response to an awkward question. In a lengthy and relaxed press conference, where Shiels had spoken movingly of the importance of football to communities in Northern Ireland, which should have been the headline, he had been asked about the promising performances of a couple of players and, after he had sung individual praises, he moved on to the overall performance and the above tumbled out. Shiels has since apologised in a brief statement released by the Irish Football Association. “I wish to apologise for my comments made in the post-match press conference last night,” he said. “I am sorry for the offence that they have caused. Last night was a special occasion for the women’s game in Northern Ireland and I am proud to manage a group of players who are role models for so many girls, and boys, across the country. I am an advocate for the women’s game and passionate about developing opportunities for women and girls to flourish.” People make mistakes and, in the heat of the moment, can word things in a way they don’t truly mean but Shiels’ apology for offence caused, without any recognition of the inaccuracies or inappropriateness, is ultimately a non-apology. Moreover, his original comment implied that this was far from an off-the-cuff theory but something he has thought about, and there are a number of big problems with that. First, there is zero science behind his claims. More goals may well be scored in quick succession in the women’s game and his stats and analysis may well show that to be true. But to conclude that a psychological or emotional deficiency in women is the root cause of this speaks to deeper sexist views and perpetuates stereotypes. For too long women have faced criticism for being too emotional or sensitive or overdramatic, feeding a narrative that women are erratic and unruly whereas men are calm, collected and in charge. There are many reasons why, if accurate, there may be more goals conceded in women’s football than men’s. For example, inexperience (the Northern Ireland players will be competing in their first major tournament this summer, for instance) or a fitness gap that can be exposed by far fewer players being full-time professionals (Northern Ireland’s part-time squad members are in a seven-month professional camp in the run-up to the Euros). All of which makes jumping on some perceived weakness in women even more bizarre. Regardless, inherent in Shiels’ comment is that there is something wrong with being emotional and that, in this scenario, men aren’t and women are and that this is a problem that needs fixing. It is a big concern when the person saying it is in charge of the progress and development of a senior women’s national football team. The message it sends to young boys and girls is not a good one. The beauty of football is that it is packed with emotion. The ebbs and flows of a game are built from the emotions of the players and fans respond accordingly. “Kenny Shiels talking foolishness! Talking about emotional women! Didn’t that man see how many times I was crying on the PITCH! Kmt,” tweeted Ian Wright in response to the comments. The Derry-born Republic of Ireland international James McClean, a vocal critic of Shiels because of comments Shiels made during his time in charge of Derry, posted: “Gift that keeps on giving. Same guy when managing Derry said that international football has no pride anymore, that Ireland are England reserves and the North of Ireland are England reserves’ reserves and now manages the North of Ireland women’s international team.” Shiels has a history beyond those comments from 2016. The 65-year-old, manager of Northern Ireland’s women’s team since 2019, stepped away from post-match interview duties when manager of Greenock Morton in 2014 after speaking to a doctor and saying he had trouble keeping his emotions in check after matches. Controversial comments around refereeing decisions had played a part in his sacking by Kilmarnock the previous year. It is incredibly disappointing that, should Shiels continue in post, Tuesday night’s comments will likely hang like a dark cloud around a team showing real promise and developmental growth. These types of remarks cannot go unchallenged or be overlooked, even though Shiels is, by all accounts, well-liked by the players and has done a good job.

4/14/2022,"“Next year we will have fun, you will see,” Mattia Binotto told his driver Charles Leclerc over the radio as last season came to a close in Abu Dhabi. Ferrari’s team principal could not have known quite how prophetic his words were to prove but Leclerc’s beaming smile and the infectious joie de vivre he has demonstrated in his driving leaves no doubt as to just quite what a blast he is having. The team have delivered for Leclerc then but now face the altogether more serious business of turning fun into Formula One glory. Two years ago Ferrari endured a torrid season: their car, with which they would celebrate their 1,000th F1 grand prix at Mugello, was a howler. They failed to win a race and finished sixth in the constructors’ championship, a nadir to which they had not sunk for 40 years. Last season there was an improvement to third but only in a midfield fight far from the dominating Red Bull and Mercedes competition. Leclerc kept this head down and pushed the car to its limits and sometimes beyond as he reached for performance that was simply not there, while the team threw all their resources at developing this year’s model adhering to the new regulations. It has paid off, with the F1-75 the class of the current field. Finally given the right machinery, the 24-year-old Monégasque driver has definitively proved his promise as a world champion contender. Leclerc has two wins and a second place from three races. The victories were exemplary. In Bahrain he saw off a boisterous, elbows-out Max Verstappen with the calm precision of a seasoned pro and at the last round in Australia he won with a consummate run from pole to flag, an almost flawless display against which his rivals were powerless. Leclerc has revelled in it, his jovial radio messages to the team and effervescent demeanour reflecting a driver who is loving climbing behind the wheel. He is on song and Ferrari are the team to beat. It will be some task to do so. While Leclerc has thrilled to the script of the season openers his main rival, Red Bull’s Verstappen, has found his role hard to bear. His car has been forced to retire with mechanical problems in two of three races. The world champion did win in Saudi Arabia but it was not enough to offset the damage done. With Mercedes still struggling to bring their car up to speed to join the fight with Red Bull and Ferrari, Verstappen is the driver expected to be at the sharp end. His task is now immense. Leclerc leads Verstappen by 46 points, a chasm. To put it in perspective, for the Dutchman to retain the title it would require the largest turnaround of a points deficit since the 25-points-for-a-win system was instigated in 2010. Granted there are more races now, but only four more. Yet it is not an impossible challenge. Sebastian Vettel came back from 44 points down to Fernando Alonso to take the championship in 2012 and even last season Lewis Hamilton overturned a 32-point deficit to Verstappen in the course of two races, before being pipped at the post. Yet if Red Bull are to challenge Ferrari they simply cannot allow themselves any more DNFs, a fact Binotto noted pointedly with a racing truism in Australia. “To finish first, first you need to finish,” he said. “The reliability is a key element of the performance itself and I think that as a team, we put a priority on it.” Putting together the full package – development, execution, engineering and driving – is key; Ferrari know their points advantage is not enough. In 2017 and 2018 they opened the season with the quickest car and Vettel enjoyed an early lead. Both challenges faltered as they were out-developed and outraced by Hamilton and Mercedes. In what is going to be a fierce development war this year, Ferrari cannot afford to be found wanting, nor can they be operationally flawed as the pressure inevitably ramps up, as the Scuderia look for their first drivers’ title since 2007 and their first constructors’ since 2008. If the team take a win at the next round in Imola next week it will be their most successful opening to a season since that title year in 2008. A victory in the home race at the circuit named for their founder and his son, the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari, would be particularly sweet. Enzo – l’Ingegnere, the Engineer – would doubtless appreciate what Binotto has achieved with his prancing horse this season. “A racing car is like a child to me,” Ferrari once said. “Your child is an extension of yourself, you take it to school and when it does well in its studies, when it comes first in its class you are proud.” They are rightly proud in Maranello, indeed there is an honest confidence at the task ahead that must be daunting to the opposition. “All the elements need to be in place, properly in place, to join the championship,” said Binotto in Australia. “As of today, we are much better prepared compared to the past to do the proper job as well in development.” This is a feisty Ferrari, the rosso corsa – racing red – fired up for a fight and having fun along the way, a welcome return for F1’s most famous marque. “I hope it continues like this,” said Leclerc. “If it does, then we probably have chances for the championship, which obviously makes me smile.”",Sport/Sport,Charles Leclerc having plenty of F1 fun with resurgent Ferrari,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/13/charles-leclerc-having-plenty-of-f1-fun-with-resurgent-ferrari
4/14/2022,"‘Tell me if you start to feel dizzy,” the operator says, clamping the virtual reality helmet to my head, as I sit on one of a row of little padded stools, somewhere in the carpeted intergalactic welcoming pavilion whose exterior is cunningly disguised as the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens, London. Soon the droney space music starts up. Transported to some far-flung region of the universe, we are successively enveloped in a gooey matrix of alien frogspawn, bombarded by cosmic dust and inseminated by writhing screen-saver tentacles. Distant suns glow like headlights in fog. I keep resisting going towards the light, just in case I’m having one of those near-death experiences described by those who have returned from the brink. I crouch and tilt and fling my head back in my VR goggles, not so much in awe as to get a better view, hoping to draw the looming aliens closer. Then I’m surrounded by a storm of stardust, like being pitched into a tumble dryer of polystyrene snow, whose mesmerising flow patterns and vortices suck me in. Removing the headset, it is a slight surprise to find there’s nothing to brush off my trousers, not even a speck of interstellar dandruff. Somehow, the VR experience in French artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster’s Alienarium 5 is all a bit hokey. If I were a creature from a far galaxy I think I’d find the welcome at this earthside arrival portal a bit confusing. One such extraterrestrial being looms in the semi-dark of a sealed room, visible through little holes drilled in the wall. Maybe someone left the creature in there, like a mop in a cupboard, and forgot about it. Perhaps the space being is in quarantine or awaiting a visit from Priti Patel, dressed in a hazmat suit. The being is a sort of lump in a flowing skirt-like substance. From whatever angle you see it, the lump looks like the back of someone’s head. If you are outside the building and stand close enough to the gallery windows, holographic alien beings become visible, floating in darkened space. Cosmic dancer, animated dandelion head, thing from ‘Oumuamua or the Oort cloud. Who knows? A little further away in the park, among trees, stands a sign-like abstract sculpture, a statue “in remembrance of the coming alien”. It looks a bit like a diagram of reproductive organs done in pearlescent tubing. I guess aliens might look like this, but the chances we would even recognise one if we saw them could be remote. They might look like an artwork. Or a tree, a park rubbish bin, or just about anything. Gonzalez-Foerster likes to conflate the words “art” and “alien”. I was so anticipating this show. Much delayed by the pandemic, it has finally landed. The overall conceit presents itself as a sort of arrivals suite for extraterrestrial visitors. Nice carpeting (with a Uranus motif), welcoming neon signage, drifty music and friendly gallery staff who, when I beamed in, sported Teletubby aerials on their heads. Whatever happened to Alienariums 1 to 4, I ask. The title, it turns out, is a reference to Kurt Vonnegut’s 1969 part sci-fi, part anti-war novel Slaughterhouse-Five. The title might also suggest we’ve been plunged into the middle of things. As it is, Gonzalez-Foerster’s work is always a concatenation of new things, older things, reimaginings and reworkings, labyrinthine internal references, running themes, gags and gambits. Along with the aliens, such as they are, literary and artistic references abound. Cushions in the form of books are meant to litter the floor of the circular central space, but they weren’t there on my visit. No A Planet of Viruses, no John Brunner’s Stand on Zanzibar, no Ursula K Le Guin, no John Wyndham. Maybe the aliens ate them. Gonzalez-Foerster is also keen on bibliography, and her diorama, titled Metapanorama, which fills the continuous circular wall surrounding the central space, presents both a cosmology and a cast of characters, much in the manner of Jann Haworth and Peter Blake’s cover of the Beatles 1967 Sgt Pepper album, but at a much more expansive and higher production level. More than a random accumulation of 195 images, including Saturn’s moons, Earth seen from space, asteroids and nebulae and clunky spaceships from old movies, there are dozens and dozens of portraits of artists, writers (JG Ballard, Philip K Dick), film-makers (Tarkovsky), thinkers, spiritualists, scientists (Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing among them) movie characters (the artist herself as a character from Blade Runner, David Bowie as The Man Who Fell to Earth), jellyfish, slime moulds, fungi, a Triffid, the Teletubbies, blood vessels, artworks including a suspended woman in Japanese rope-bondage by Nobuyoshi Araki, sculptures by Henry Moore, fragments of works by Richard Hamilton and many others. Some images amid this vast montage reference artists and works that have previously been seen at the Serpentine, including Gustav Metzger, Phillipe Parreno, Hilma af Klint and Yayoi Kusama. Meanwhile, Diana, Princess of Wales, wanders through. Here comes everybody. The overall effect of Gonzalez-Foerster’s Metapanorama, with its crowds and natural and supernatural wonders, spiritualist thought-forms, a wobbling disembodied eye by Odilon Redon, weird geologies, floating worlds and event horizons, is part medieval cosmography, part Victorian scrapbook, part lexicon, part exploded view of the artist’s inner mental processes. Among it all are signs for Alien parking lots and for the Galactic cabaret, as well as notices telling us to stop the war. The whole thing is a gigantic eschatological wormhole. At their best artists are more than, or different from, the sum of their references. It is only with her diorama, which one enters and leaves through irregularly shaped holes cut into the wall, that Gonzalez-Foerster’s world really takes flight, although she has reconfigured the building in such a way that, if you are already familiar with the gallery’s layout, is pleasingly discombobulating. Unless, that is, you find yourself spat out into some alternative multiverse. Do not worry: in an otherwise empty side room is a circular couch in case you need a quiet lie down, and to wait for an alien to come and soothe you. I’m sure there will be one along soon.

4/14/2022,"Finland and Sweden could both seek to join Nato within weeks, their prime ministers have announced, saying Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that her country, which shares a 1,300km (810 mile) border with Russia, would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months” despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. Speaking alongside her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, at a joint press conference in Stockholm, Marin said Finland had to be “prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia” and that “everything had changed” when Moscow attacked Ukraine. “The difference between being a partner and a member is very clear, and will remain so. There is no other way to have security guarantees than under Nato’s deterrence and common defence as guaranteed by the alliance’s Article 5,” she said. Article 5, the 30-member alliance’s collective defence cornerstone, states that an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all of its members. It has only been invoked once in the organisation’s history, in response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Andersson said there was “no point” in delaying analysis of whether it was right for Sweden to apply for Nato membership. “There is a before and after 24 February”, she said – the date on which Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. “This is a very important time in history. The security landscape has completely changed,” said Andersson. “We have to analyse the situation to see what is best for Sweden’s security, for the Swedish people, in this new situation.” A Finnish government white paper released on Wednesday on the country’s “fundamentally changed” security environment made no recommendation on Nato but will serve as the basis for a parliamentary debate due to take place after Easter. “I think people’s mindsets in Finland, also in Sweden, changed and were shaped very dramatically by Russia’s actions,” Marin said. “This is very clear and that caused a need for a process in Finland to have a discussion about our own security choices.” She said the country needed “to be very frank about consequences and the risks. There are both short-term and more long-term risks. These risks are there both if we apply and if we do not apply.” A recent opinion poll showed 68% of Finnish respondents in favour of joining the alliance, more than double the figure before the invasion, with only 12% against. Polling in Sweden suggests a slim majority of Swedes now also back membership. Both countries are officially non-aligned militarily, but became Nato partners – taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence – after abandoning their previous stance of strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Sweden’s ruling centre-left Social Democrats, led by Andersson, this week began debating whether the country should drop its opposition to joining Nato, abandoning a decades-long belief that peace was best kept by not publicly choosing sides. The question is expected to be a key issue in parliamentary elections due on 11 September, with centre-right opposition parties already saying they would back a Nato application and the far-right Sweden Democrats also open to the idea. Many commentators expect the two Nordic nations to act in tandem on whether to join, although Finland – widely seen as likely to apply before a Nato summit in Madrid scheduled for June – looks closer than Sweden. A Swedish security policy review is due to end before the end of May and Andersson has said she will await its outcome before making any decisions. However, a positive Finnish decision would pile pressure on Sweden to follow suit. Both countries have received public assurances from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, that their applications would be welcome, as well as expressions of support from members including the US, UK, Germany and France.

4/14/2022,"The photographer Frank Martin, who has died aged 89, was on the staff of the Guardian from 1964 to 1997, creating an extensive body of work that covered news, arts, fashion, politics and international events. During his career on the paper he photographed most of his notable contemporaries. These included, among hundreds of others, a young Judi Dench at home and Mark Rylance in rehearsal; the artists Andy Warhol and David Hockney; Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter on the presidential campaign trail in 1976. He captured Fidel Castro and Twiggy; the prime ministers Harold Wilson and Edward Heath; the novelists Joseph Heller and Norman Mailer; the Rolling Stones in an early TV appearance in 1964; and the giant pandas Chia Chia and Ching Ching reunited at London Zoo after an unsuccessful mating trip to Washington. Frank was in Aberfan for the disaster in 1966; in Belfast during the Troubles, when he got “roughed up” by rioters; and he travelled to India to photograph Rajiv Gandhi’s funeral in 1991, but ended up being sent to cover the floods in Bangladesh, where he took a hugely affecting image of a young child holding her dying baby sibling. In 1967 he had witnessed the Torrey Canyon oil disaster off the south-west coast of Britain and wrote about the experience. The variety of his subjects was astounding. He would work with just two cameras (Pentaxes, then latterly Nikons), a couple of lenses and a flashgun. The flashgun was usually left in his elegant leather camera case – “available light” was the preferred illumination for the atmospheric portraits that he shot. One Sunday in June 1989, Frank was in the Guardian office as the duty photographer. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, had died the night before. It was decided that Frank should try to get to the funeral in Tehran. By maxing out his credit card and raiding the managing editor’s safe, an air ticket was bought and he was on his way. He did not need to go home; he always carried his passport. To actually get to the funeral, along with millions of mourners, required Frank to draw on all his experience, resilience and bravery. He ended up at the graveside almost carried by the crowd, but he took some career-defining pictures and was on a plane back to London that night. In the 1970s and 80s Frank was one of the vast international posse of photographers who followed the twice-yearly, ready-to-wear cycle from Milan to Paris to New York to London. Brenda Polan, the Guardian’s fashion editor at the time (and later women’s editor), said: “Frank’s subject of choice as a photographer was wildlife and he was very good at it, not just because of his expert eye for composition but because he had the patience to wait calmly for the animal to move into shot. That was exactly what catwalk photography demanded – and he was very good at that too.” He was much admired across the fashion industry and designers often commissioned him to moonlight and take their publicity shots. As a newspaper photographer trained to not just get the picture but to get it into the dark room and into the paper before the deadline, he was fast. “In a profession where one supermodel shot could take a whole tedious day, Frank got the perfect pic in minutes,” said Polan. He contributed more than just images to the Guardian. He was that rarity among photographers – he could write. For several years, as well as shooting fashion Frank wrote about it too. From Milan in 1979 he reported: “Next autumn’s fashionable woman ... is likely to be a wide shouldered, spiky heeled superwoman with maybe a snap brim trilby and a pinstripe suit ... Square, padded shoulders are inescapable, with peaks and puffs and wings and some leg o’mutton sleeves from Walter Albini; but you will not have to look like Al Capone on his wedding day. The successful designs have balanced the wide tops with clean sweeping lines from neck to hem, full of unfussy sleeves and tailoring excellence.” All his fashion articles were illustrated with his own pictures. Frank was born in West Ham, east London. His father, Frederick, was a carpenter turned bus driver and his mother, Rose (nee Higgs), worked in a garden shop. He attended the Beal modern school in Ilford before doing his national service in the RAF photographic reconnaissance unit based at RAF Benson in Oxfordshire, where he also met his future wife, Ann Williams; they married in 1953. Like several other photographers of his generation, he got bitten by the photo bug during his spell in the RAF. Following his demob he worked as a “darkroom boy” with a Fleet Street news agency, before landing a job at Bernsen’s International Press Service (BIPS). His successful apprenticeship at BIPS doing all manner of assignments for magazines and national newspapers led to his staff job in the Guardian’s London office in 1964. In the early days there he also wrote articles for the British Journal of Photography, including a spread on life as a press photographer on London’s coldest street, doorstepping No 10, and an interview with the leading sports photographer of the time, Ed Lacey. In 1977 he was named Men’s Fashion Writer of the Year. Frank was a respected photographer among his peers, and described by Polan as “a tall, tranquil presence in the heart of the mob hysteria” that often prevailed at the international fashion shows. “We travelled together for half a decade,” she recalled, “muttering to each other that this fashion circus was not really a grown-up way to make a living. I would drag him to fashion parties and designer dinners where you never got a bite before midnight. His oft-repeated gentle reproach, ‘This is another fine mess you’ve got me into, Polan,’ still rings in my ears every time a situation gets sticky.” After retiring in 1997, Frank returned to his favourite subject, wildlife, and continued to build a large archive. Ann, who was a crafts teacher, died in 2012; Frank is survived by his daughter, also Ann.

4/14/2022,"At 9.50pm on Tuesday Chelsea’s players gathered on the Bernabéu touchline to prepare for extra time, having just beaten Real Madrid 3-1 in their own stadium over 90 minutes: a sensational result in isolation, but with a tinge of dread now too, a sense of having run themselves to a state of exhaustion in pursuit of a retreating mirage. Rodrygo’s goal 10 minutes from the end of normal time will be remembered for Luka Modric’s sublime diagonal pass, a weird, snaking, dipping thing, like an entity from some other physical plane. But the effect of that goal on the opposition was also striking. There was still time for Thomas Tuchel to send on Christian Pulisic, and for Pulisic to miss the chance at the death that would have rescripted in an instant every version of this extraordinary game, recast Madrid’s dynastic will to power as decadent amour-propre, altered the trajectory of seasons and careers, and anointed Tuchel once and for all as the great tactical white whale of west London. The difference with Madrid, however, the big secret, is that they tend to take those moments. And so half an hour of suffering beckoned. But the break was also box office in its own right. Antonio Rüdiger barked and slapped shoulders. For a while two middle-aged men in club tracksuits crouched behind Reece James and pounded furiously at his buttocks – vital work, so vital in fact that a third man briefly came and joined them. In the middle of this Tuchel gathered his players in a tight circle and delivered a fluent two-minute speech, hands scything the air, skipping from foot to foot, replicating even in the gawky physicality of his pep talk the movements, the shapes, the concussive texture of his team’s performance. With a day’s grace, and even in agreeably bad-tempered defeat, the image of Tuchel buried inside that circle seems to capture something vital. Not just about his effect on Chelsea’s players; but also the reciprocal nature of that relationship, the energy, the uplift injected into his own career. There is no doubt Tuchel’s star has risen dramatically in England. Not least in the past two months as the public face of a distressed asset, wandering through this collapsing seat of power like one of nature’s dukes, bow tie askew, brushing the dust from his lapels. Two things seem certain now as this ghost-ship season narrows towards Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final. First, whichever consortium ends up buying Chelsea needs to base its entire early years strategy around keeping Tuchel at the club. This is not in any immediate doubt, beyond the odd casual whisper (and there are always whispers). Tuchel’s contract runs until 2024. He remains in his own Imperial phase, revered by the club’s support and right under the skin of this group of players. But there is still flux here. Every last member of the current hierarchy will surely depart with the change of owners. Football is a peculiar beast. And Tuchel is, right now, Chelsea’s single brightest star presence. There is also another side to that ledger. It is easy to forget that this goggle-eyed super-brain, a man who seems now to have been born to fret and chunter and disco-finger about on the Chelsea touchline in his powder-blue quilted coat, was also in need of a home when he arrived at Stamford Bridge. Tuchel was a success at Borussia Dortmund, but he left under a cloud, subject of a casual character assassination by the CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, who questioned his “basic values”, from communication skills to loyalty and trust. So, just those then. He took Paris Saint-Germain to a slightly weird Covid-addled Champions League final but was then sacked and waved off gleefully by that rather sickly group of players, a departure that could probably also work as a character reference. Here was an elite coach whose star had dipped, who seemed still to be finding a level, a way to work in this company. In this sense Chelsea have been perfect for Tuchel. When he turned up the squad was stacked deep with talent, but also tactically incoherent, fogged with Lampard-ism. Talented, familiar ostracised players were perfectly set up to be high-fived back into the fold. All of this was low-hanging fruit for a man whose entire waking life revolves around granular tactical detail. What has become clear is that Tuchel thrives on working in a state of total focus, on fixing and tinkering at high speed, without external distractions; and that coming to Chelsea in mid-season was just the kind of impossible job to fit his talents. The same could even be applied to the mind-boggling oddities of the past two months: unwanted and clearly destabilising, but in an odd kind of way suited also to Tuchel’s finer qualities, his eloquence, his basic honesty. For a while in March Chelsea’s manager seemed to have become the UK’s most coherent public voice on the war in Ukraine, revered for his ability to speak a few simple truths. On BT Sport Jake Humphrey had a habit of cutting from Tuchel’s post-match comments as though relaying an address to the galactic resistance from Yoda’s cave. Joe Cole suggested Tuchel should become prime minister, and it didn’t really sound like a joke. If there was a tendency to swoon at Tuchel’s ability simply to keep the season rolling on it is worth noting his success even in that first year was based in that ability to focus entirely on the details in front of his nose, to block out non-essential pressures, to draw his players into that same bubble. By contrast, asking Tuchel to manage a team of A-list superstars, to deal with the princely whims of Neymar on a daily basis, always looked an absurd piece of recruitment. Tuchel may be a more ludic and compelling tactician than Carlo Ancelotti. But can anyone really imagine him digging out the same results in charge of Real Madrid? Or succeeding at any of those clubs where saying less is saying more, where intense, non-negotiable tactical detail is essentially an act of self-sabotage? Tuchel is a coach not an impresario, the kind of high-functioning obsessive who will flourish in the right soil. It seems telling that his clearest failure at Chelsea has been the inability to draw more or indeed anything at all from Romelu Lukaku, the closest thing to a superstar player, in his own mind at least, in the squad. Like Mauricio Pochettino, his best moments are always likely to come from driving on a team of biddable energetic players at a level just below the outright superstars. He remains Chelsea’s prized asset. But this is also a matter of chemistry, of mutual dependence. More so than Lords roped in, funds promised, or supporter engagement schtick, preserving that balance will be absolutely vital to the success of the latest new era.",Sport/Football,"Whatever happens next at Chelsea, there is a clear priority: keep Tuchel | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/13/whatever-happens-next-at-chelsea-there-is-a-clear-priority-keep-tuchel
4/14/2022,"Feeling “burned” by her husband’s first run for the presidency, Jill Biden resisted advisers including Ron Klain, now White House chief of staff, who pushed him to mount another campaign in 2004. “All these men – and they were mostly men – coming to our home,” she said. “You know, ‘You’ve got to run, you’ve got to run.’ I wanted no part of it.” The first lady was speaking to Julie Pace and Darlene Superville, co-authors of Jill: A Biography of the First Lady, which will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. “I didn’t even know whether I wanted Joe to ever do it again,” Jill Biden said. “I mean, I had been so burned.” Joe Biden first ran for president in 1987, withdrawing amid allegations that he plagiarised the leader of the British Labour party, Neil Kinnock, in campaign remarks. Jill Biden was describing a meeting at the Bidens’ house in Delaware more than 15 years later, when Joe Biden met Mark Gitenstein, a long-term adviser, and Klain joined on speakerphone. John Kerry, then a Massachusetts senator, was favourite for the Democratic nomination to challenge George W Bush. But, the authors write, “some party leaders thought Joe could go head-to-head with [the] president … in the general election”. “There were always so many people trying to get Joe to run,” Jill Biden said. “You’ve got to run again. You’ve got to try again. Always. It was constant. “He knew that I wasn’t in favour of his running.” The authors cite Jill Biden’s autobiography, Where the Light Enters, published in 2019, in which she describes “‘fuming’ out by the pool” while the meeting with Klain and Gitenstein went on. Jill Biden writes that she eventually cut the meeting off by drawing “NO” on her stomach with a Sharpie pen and “march[ing] through the room in my bikini. “Needless to say, they got the message.” “Joe and Gitenstein did, at any rate,” Pace and Superville write. “Klain, still eagerly engaged on speakerphone and unaware of what had just transpired in the room, kept brainstorming away. “‘I don’t understand it,’ a bewildered Klain said later when Gitenstein called to explain. ‘The conversation was going so great and all of a sudden, it just stopped.’” Joe Biden did mount a second run for the White House in 2008, with Jill’s support, but dropped out early, unable to compete with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. He was Obama’s vice-president for eight years, spent four years in apparent retirement, then beat Donald Trump in 2020 to become, at 78, the oldest president inaugurated for the first time. Pace and Superville describe how Jill Biden supported her husband’s second and third White House runs. Klain was appointed to oversee the effort against Ebola in 2014 and remains one of Joe Biden’s closest and most powerful advisers. Last year, the New York Times reported that “Republicans have taken to calling him Prime Minister Klain”, a characterisation Klain has disputed. Gitenstein, a lawyer who worked for the Senate judiciary committee when Biden chaired it, was ambassador to Romania under Obama. He advised Biden in 2020 and is now US ambassador to the European Union. Jill Biden’s most senior male aide is Anthony Bernal. He has been described, by Politico, as both “an influential figure” and “one of the most polarising people” in the Biden White House.",Arts/Books,‘All these men’: Jill Biden resented Joe’s advisers who pushed White House run,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/13/jill-biden-joe-advisers-biography-first-lady-book
4/14/2022,"Standing next to a Chernobyl checkpoint, Vasily Davidenko recalled the day Russia invaded. “They were hooligans,” he said, pointing to a tourist kiosk shot up and adorned with the words “Chernobyl ice-cream”. Next to a pockmarked bus stop was debris left behind by Vladimir Putin’s army: machine-gun bullets, cigarette packets and an empty tin of tuna. “It was a difficult time. People are worried the Russians might come back,” Davidenko said. He added: “I talked to the Russian soldiers as they drove past. They were young guys from Siberia. They asked me: ‘Batya [Dad], how are you living?’ I answered: ‘We are fine here, thanks very much.’” Russian forces trundled into the Chernobyl exclusion zone on 24 February in the early hours of the invasion. According to Davidenko, they crossed over the Pripyat River from Belarus using a pontoon bridge. They then headed towards the Chernobyl nuclear power station, covered with a giant sarcophagus, the scene of the disastrous 1986 accident. By breakfast time they had seized the station. Russian troops disarmed the 169 Ukrainian national guards based at the plant and rounded up its technical staff, 103 people. They established a command centre and began digging fortifications including tank shelters, trenches and an underground kitchen. For 1,000 servicemen, Chernobyl became home. The Kremlin seemed unaware of – of indifferent to – the risks posed by radiation to its service personnel. The bulk of Putin’s invading army kept going. It headed south through the pine forest and along a smooth asphalt road leading to Kyiv, 130km away. The route goes past bucolic mini-lakes and bogs, and past gulls and the odd swan. “On the second day, 1,700 vehicles went through my village,” Davidenko said. “We counted them. They moved in four lanes. There were combat and Mi-2 transport helicopters flying continuously above us in formation, shaking the windows. The Ka-52 attack helicopters flew extremely low, 100 metres from the ground, dipping up and down.” Davidenko, 68, works as a ranger in Chernobyl’s national park. It is situated inside the 30km exclusion zone, which covers 260,000 hectares of territory. The Russian infantry fighting vehicles arriving every few minutes threw up clouds of radioactive dust. Soldiers, meanwhile, worked and slept in Chernobyl’s prohibited deadly red zone, near the abandoned city of Pripyat. Historians may describe what happened around Chernobyl as a case of imperial hubris. Speaking on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Kremlin had expected it could seize Kyiv within 48 hours. It had not anticipated much resistance. “Russia’s leadership expected to see a parade on Khreschatyk [the capital’s main street] after a few days,” he said. Instead, Ukrainian fighters ambushed the column near the city of Ivankiv, down the road from the Chernobyl checkpoint. Davidenko said he and other locals passed on the coordinates of enemy vehicles. This allowed home artillery to target the advance with lethal accuracy. Ukrainian soldiers slipped through the forest on foot or quad bikes, a phantom outfit of partisans. Enraged, the Russians began hunting for Ukrainian “spies”. Davidenko said they interrogated civilians in his village, Prybirsk, and confiscated mobile phones. “They even searched our clothes in case we had concealed notes,” he recounted. “Five young people had taken pictures of their tanks. They took them away. We don’t know what happened to them.” Ivan, a Ukrainian soldier nicknamed “the Frenchman”, said Russian troops were taken aback when they came under fire. They expected bread and salt – a traditional Ukrainian greeting – and were instead met with “fire and sword”, he said. He added: “The Moscow plan was blitzkrieg. When we attacked, it quickly became hell for them. Some abandoned their vehicles and ran off.” He stressed: “We knew the locality. They didn’t know how to orientate themselves.” Ivan praised his commanding officer for staying cool under Russian shelling. He said he took part in the battle for Kyiv last month around the city of Irpin. “We were under tremendous pressure. We Cossacks don’t go on our knees for anyone, except for our mothers and the national flag. This isn’t merely a war for our independence. It’s for European values,” he said. Over at the nuclear power plant, the original staff worked for 25 days under Russian supervision. Forty-five volunteers then replaced them. All were unable to monitor radiation levels because the soldiers stole their computer servers. They also took table, furniture, microwaves and Chernobyl staff uniforms, said Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone state agency. Kramarenko said the troops would have breathed in radioactive nucleotides, especially during physical activity and trench-digging. “We believe they will feel the consequences of the radiation they received. Some sooner, some later,” he said. “This is the first time the world has seen tanks at a nuclear power plant.” For more than a month the Russians also occupied the villages surrounding the zone. Five of them broke into the farmstead where Yulia Mikhailenko, 28, lived with her mother, Zoya, and her daughters, six-year-old Karmila and one-year-old Zlata, in Khocheva. The women hid in the forest for several days, cold and hungry, until one of the girls got sick with a temperature. Mikhailenko went home to get medicine. She found the conscripts living there. They had broken her front door. “The house was a mess. They took everything. Gold, my laptop, flashcards and all of our crockery, including the frying pan. I said: “You can see children live here. Why did you do this?’ They looked a bit guilty and stared at their boots. They also cut our electricity cable.” On her fridge the soldiers had scratched: “Glory to Russia”. They painted graffiti on an outside wall of a monkey smiley beneath the word “Ukraine”. The monkey had a cross for a mouth – implying, it appeared, that Mikhailenko’s country should now shut up. “We were very afraid,” she said. “Then on 31 March they suddenly left.” The Kremlin announced that it was pulling its forces out of the Kyiv region in preparation for a major offensive in the east. The Russians had advanced from Chernobyl as far as the village of Demydiv, between the Irpin river and a dam next to Kyiv’s reservoir. They were unable to go further. As they retreated back to the exclusion zone, the blew up several bridges. Back in the exclusion zone, soldiers drove a stream of stolen Ukrainian vehicles back to Belarus, as well as their own military hardware. They took the captured national guardsmen with them. They were summoned to the power plant’s conference room, where their hands were bound, and they were driven off. “We don’t know where they are,” Kramarenko said. Ukraine’s nuclear agency is now trying to clear up the damage. The plant is still without electricity. The departing Russians left tripwires and mines concealed among radioactive trees. Kramarenko said five of his staff were killed while fighting in territorial defence units. Others were in a “difficult” psychological state after being forced to cohabit with their occupiers. On Wednesday the signs of fighting were all around. A kilometre from the Dytiatky control point the carcass of a burnt-out Russian infantry vehicle lay on the forest road. “Glory to Ukraine” was painted on its side in white letters. Swirling tracks in the sand and cut fir branches marked where its crew had parked. There were Russian ration packages and empty bottles. Davidenko said he had survived the Russian takeover relatively unscathed. He managed to hide his car, snowplough and canoe in the forest. The exclusion zone’s animal denizens appeared to have ignored one of this century’s most extraordinary battles, he said. They included bears, elk, deer and white storks who feed from the fish-rich Pripyat River. “They are flourishing. Their numbers are going up,” he said.",News/World news,‘They were hooligans’: Chernobyl locals reeling after Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/they-were-hooligans-chernobyl-locals-reeling-after-russian-invasion

4/14/2022,"Stephen Colbert discussed troubling inflation figures released this week: prices have jumped 8.5% since last March, the highest rate of inflation in the US since 1981, affecting especially food, shelter and gasoline. “So you shouldn’t be affected as long as you don’t eat anything, be anywhere, or go any place,” the Late Show host mused on Tuesday evening. In an effort to reduce gas prices, Joe Biden has waived a federal rule banning summer sales of E15 gasoline, a fuel with a higher blend of ethanol than regular gas. “Oooh, a blend! This sounds so sophisticated,” Colbert joked. “I’m getting notes of Iowa corn, some oaky hydrocarbons, oh this is really fracking my taste buds. Is this from North Dakota?” The E15 blend costs 10 cents per gallon less on average than regular gas. “OK so that’s … uh … yeah, still not enough to save the Democrats in the midterms,” said Colbert, holding a faux calculator. Colbert also touched on a disgraced former Trump lawyer, John Eastman, who is still pushing to decertify the 2020 election. “That’s right, the election that’s been over for a year and a half! And which Biden won!” Colbert exclaimed. “To put that into perspective, when the election was decided, J-Lo was engaged to a different guy.” Eastman recently visited Wisconsin and urged the Republican assembly speaker, Robin Vos, to nullify the 2020 election, and specifically to move forward with “either … having a new slate of electors seated that would declare someone else the winner.” “A do-over?!” Colbert fumed. “Our ex-president isn’t allowed a ‘do-over’ just because he didn’t like the result the first time! That’s how you get an Eric.” With inflation skyrocketing, that 20% off coupon to Bed, Bath & Beyond isn't looking like junk mail now is it pic.twitter.com/l8hsbfPWps Trevor Noah also discussed soaring inflation on Tuesday’s Daily Show. “Seriously? This inflation is taking us back to 1981?” he said. “I don’t want to go back to 1981! First of all, there’s no wifi. Secondly, I could never pull off a Jheri curl, people.” Noah attempted to explain what was happening: “because the economy opened up suddenly, and the government gave everyone money, everyone is spending again. But there’s supply chain issues, so there’s not enough products for people to buy, so that drives the prices up. And then on top of that, Vladimir Putin decided that, oh, now would be a nice time to Airbnb eastern Ukraine by force, raising oil prices, which makes everything more expensive. “The point is: everything has gotten expensive,” he concluded. “So expensive that even Bed Bath & Beyond coupons are starting to get all cocky with us – ‘Well, well, well, who’s the junk mail now!’” In Hollywood, “it’s hard to get a movie made,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night. “You have Oscar-winning actors, writers, directors, every one of them has a project that they can’t get going, so that is why it comes as a surprise” that there’s a picture in the works about Spirit Halloween, a seasonal US pop-up store. The company is what Kimmel called a “scavenger store”, as in “when another store passes away, they put a sign up and they fill it with knock-off Harley Quinn costumes”. “Two companies thought this was a good idea,” said Kimmel. “Maybe they figure if they go broke, they can turn their offices into Spirit Halloween stores? I don’t know.” The plot of the film starring Rachael Leigh Cook and Christopher Lloyd, according to a press release obtained by Variety, will be: “When a new Spirit Halloween store appears in a deserted strip mall, three middle-school friends who think they’ve outgrown trick-or-treating make a dare to spend the night locked inside the store on Halloween night. But they soon find out that the store is haunted by an angry evil spirit who has possessed the creepy animatronic characters. “Which to me sounds like a regular visit to Chuck E Cheese at any time of year,” Kimmel quipped. Back to the Future’s Lloyd “is going to use his time machine to travel back to kill his agents for putting him in this movie”. “Why not a movie about the 99 cent store?” Kimmel wondered. “I mean, Spirit Halloween isn’t even a real store – it’s a parasite that feeds off the bodies of dead stores!

4/14/2022,"An errant bear has reappeared in his favourite Italian town after a failed attempt to rewild him. The two-year-old Marsican brown bear, affectionately known as Juan Carrito, walked 150km “home” to Roccaraso, a small mountain town in the Abruzzo region, bypassing several other towns along the way. Carrito was spotted outside the train station on Tuesday morning, three weeks after being taken back to the mountains following a spell in an enclosure as experts endeavoured to adapt him to his natural environment. The bear has been a regular visitor to the town and became a social media star after breaking into a bakery in Roccaraso last November and eating a batch of freshly-made biscuits. The break-in led to him being captured and banished to a remote area in the mountains, but he was soon back, leading to a second capture in early March and a period in the enclosure. He has often slept among the pine trees at the entrance to the town of about 1,500 inhabitants, before going in search of food, rummaging through bins and dining off leftover pizza and sandwiches, and drinking from fountains. Carrito has also been noted for his playfulness towards dogs. His movements are monitored by experts at the Majella national park, home to the rare Marsican bears, via his radio collar. In the days before venturing back to Roccaraso, he was detected close to other towns but did not drop by. “It’s a bad thing to say from a nature point of view, but for him, it seems natural to be in Roccaraso, where there is activity, people and other animals,” said Lucio Zazzara, the president of the Majella national park. “Although it seems he only missed it to a certain extent, because for three weeks he substantially lived as a bear, eating food in his natural environment, and didn’t go close to homes, nor did he search in bins for food.” Carrito’s movements and behaviour will continue to be observed before a decision is made to recapture him.",News/World news,Bear famous for Italian bakery break-in reappears after attempt to rewild him ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/bear-famous-for-italian-bakery-break-in-reappears-after-attempt-to-rewild-him
4/14/2022,"Roman Abramovich has had more than £5.4bn of his assets frozen in Jersey and 12 luxury properties – including a near-£100m villa on the Riviera that was once the holiday home of King Edward VIII – seized by the French government. The Royal Court of Jersey announced on Wednesday that it had imposed a formal freezing order on “assets understood to be valued in excess of US$7bn, which are suspected to be connected to Mr Abramovich and which are either located in Jersey or owned by Jersey incorporated entities”. The Russian oligarch and Chelsea FC owner was also hit by another crackdown in France on the assets of individuals affected by sanctions. The economy and finance ministry announced on Wednesday that it had seized 33 properties owned by oligarchs who had been hit by sanctions, including a dozen belonging to Abramovich. “They include homes, superyachts and helicopters, and add up to well over €25bn,” a French finance ministry source said. “There are 33 properties that have been frozen, including a dozen belonging to Roman Abramovich.” Among the properties seized is Abramovich’s Château de la Croë villa in Cap d’Antibes, which has eight bedrooms, a 15-metre rooftop pool, gym and cinema. The villa, which was built in 1926, is set in 12 acres of manicured lawns overlooking the Mediterranean. High-end estate agents estimate the property is now worth £90m-£100m. Abramovich was subjected to UK sanctions on 10 March after ministers accused him of having “clear connections” to Putin’s regime and being among a group of rich Russian businessmen who had “blood on their hands”. However, the UK has not seized any of Abramovich’s UK properties, which include a £120m mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens just behind the royal palace. His family have amassed a UK property collection worth more than £250m, numbering about 70 homes, buildings and pieces of land. The UK is forcing him to sell Chelsea FC, which he bought in 2003 for about £140m. The government of Jersey said local police had raided several properties linked to Abramovich on Tuesday. “Search warrants were executed by the states of Jersey police on Tuesday 12 April 2022 at premises in Jersey suspected to be connected to the business activities of Roman Abramovich,” the island’s Law Officers’ Department said. Jersey is a self-governing British crown dependency favoured by the world’s wealthy for its very low taxes and reputation for strict banking secrecy. The Guardian last week revealed that a company that owns a 50-metre superyacht linked to Abramovich had been transferred to a Jersey company on the day of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The department would not comment on the yacht, and said it would not be providing any further details. A spokesperson for Abramovich did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The yacht, Aquamarine, is the fifth vessel to have been linked to Abramovich. On 24 February, ownership of the yacht passed from a company previously controlled by Abramovich to a close associate of his, the Russian businessman David Davidovich. Davidovich said he was the owner of Aquamarine as well as the Jersey-domiciled company MHC Jersey, which is registered as the owner of the yacht on the maritime database MarineTraffic. Jersey has vowed to follow the UK’s sanction regime and to “take targeted measures to prevent Jersey services providers or structures being abused”. Last month the island’s external relations minister, Ian Gorst, said the Jersey Financial Services Commission and the island’s police would cooperate “with international authorities, in particular those in the UK and across the transatlantic taskforce, where potential activities or assets are identified”. This month, the Antigua and Barbuda said it was willing to help seize two superyachts owned by Abramovich docked in its ports. Abramovich’s Riviera villa was once the holiday home of Edward VIII after he abdicated in 1936. Better known as the Duke of Windsor, he and his wife Wallis Simpson hosted Churchill’s 40th wedding anniversary at the mansion in 1948. The French authorities did not specify all of the oligarchs’ properties that had been seized but said several other large villas in Saint-Tropez and Cannes had also been targeted as well as luxury Alpine chalets in Meribel and other luxury ski resorts.",News/World news,Jersey freezes £5.4bn of assets linked to Roman Abramovich,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/jersey-freezes-54bn-of-assets-linked-to-roman-abramovich
4/14/2022,"No one will be prosecuted over the leak of CCTV footage showing Matt Hancock engaged in a clinch with a colleague in his office, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has announced. The footage and stills of the embrace, which prompted his resignation as health secretary, were leaked to the Sun in June last year. It was most likely obtained by someone using their phone to record a CCTV screen, the ICO said. Hancock stepped down from government a day after the images emerged, showing him kissing Gina Coladangelo, a longtime friend who was also a non-executive director at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), inside his ministerial office. The footage was shot on 6 May last year, meaning the clinch was a breach of Covid social distancing rules. Under the government’s unlocking timetable, intimate contact with people outside your own household was only permitted from 17 May. The ICO launched an investigation into alleged breaches of the Data Protection Act. Several weeks after the footage emerged, data protection officers raided two homes in the south of England, seizing computer equipment and electronic devices. In its statement on Wednesday the ICO said it had “found insufficient evidence to prosecute two people suspected of unlawfully obtaining and disclosing CCTV footage” from the health department. It said the inquiry was launched after complaints about a potential data breach by the US-based company Emcor, which operated the CCTV system in the department. “Forensic analysis revealed that the leaked images were most likely obtained by someone recording the CCTV footage screens with a mobile phone,” the statement said. “Six phones retrieved during the execution of search warrants did not contain the relevant CCTV footage. After taking legal advice, the ICO concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with criminal offences under the Data Protection Act 2018.” Boris Johnson initially sought to defend Hancock but accepted his resignation a day later after a wave of anger from Conservative MPs, including some ministers. Hancock has subsequently separated from his wife, Martha, with whom has three children, and is now believed to be in a relationship with Coladangelo. In 2020 Labour had complained about apparent cronyism after it emerged that Coladangelo, the head of marketing at the retail chain Oliver Bonas and a university friend of Hancock, had first been made an unpaid adviser at the DHSC and then a non-executive director, a part-time role paying £15,000 a year.",News/Politics,Inquiry into leak of Matt Hancock kiss images leads to no prosecutions,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/matt-hancock-kiss-images-ico-inquiry-no-prosecutions
