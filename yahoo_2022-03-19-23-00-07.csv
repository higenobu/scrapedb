3/19/2022,"India's refusal to condemn the invasion of Ukraine and efforts to protect trade with Russia mean one of Washington's most valued strategic partners is actively undercutting its efforts to isolate Moscow. The big picture: Vladimir Putin's invasion has become a stress test for America's global partnerships. America's treaty allies are all onside, including those outside NATO such as Japan and South Korea. India, for reasons of history and geopolitical pragmatism, is very much not. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Driving the news: India abstained on a series of UN votes condemning the invasion. One such resolution was backed by 141 countries, though a Russian diplomat contended that — with China and India both abstaining — the critics represented less than half of the global population. While the U.S. and EU have led a global push to isolate Russia economically, India has been buying up more Russian energy at a discount. Now, per the Financial Times, India's central bank is discussing a rupee-ruble trade plan with Moscow to ensure it can continue to buy Russian goods, potentially weakening the effects of Western sanctions. What they're saying: U.S. officials say they understand India's delicate position vis-a-vis Russia, though White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called on India's leaders to ""think about where you want to stand when history books are written.” The State Department dispatched and then quickly recalled a cable telling diplomats to warn counterparts from India and the UAE that their abstentions at the UN put them ""in Russia's camp,"" Axios' Hans Nichols reported earlier this month. The British trade secretary said Thursday that the U.K. is ""very disappointed"" by India's position and hopes it will change. That's not looking likely. Data: United Nations; Map: Danielle Alberti/Axios Between the lines: India's position is informed by decades of cooperation with Russia and the then-Soviet Union, including its disputes with China and Pakistan. Additionally, 70% of India's military arsenal is Russian-made, and New Delhi is counting on Moscow for additional systems and spare parts. Buying Russian oil and weaponry ""is India's way of trying to ensure that Russia keeps India's interests in mind,"" and doesn't shift toward Pakistan or become entirely beholden to China, says Aparna Pande of the Hudson Institute. That also helps explain the post-invasion silence from New Delhi. But calling for peace without picking sides is also India's default approach to global crises, she says. India doesn't want other powers to intervene over Kashmir, and is reluctant to use sanctions because it doesn't want to face sanctions itself. ""At its core, Indian foreign policy is very realpolitik,"" Pande says. For example, ""India is a democracy but India doesn't do democracy promotion."" India coordinates most closely with the U.S. than any other country, Pande adds. But rather than seeking to bind itself to Washington through a formal alliance, its focus is on balancing relations with multiple global powers, including Russia. Zoom out: India isn't alone in hedging its bets over Ukraine. Saudi Arabia has been snubbing the Biden administration as it seeks to increase oil production. Israel has condemned the invasion but is also treading lightly to protect its security coordination with Russia in Syria. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, defending his own neutral stance, went so far Thursday as to blame NATO for the ""instability"" that led to war. What to watch: Successive U.S. administrations have made India a centerpiece of their strategies to counter China. But Pande says if China claims territory in the South China Sea or even invades Taiwan, India's response will be much the same as with Ukraine. Like this article?

3/19/2022,"A Russian oligarch’s superyacht is stranded in a Norwegian port after local oil suppliers refused to refuel it because of the owner’s ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, owner of the 223-foot yacht called Ragnar, is a former KGB agent and a longtime associate of Putin who made his millions in nickel mining. He also served as Russia’s deputy minister of economy, according to The New York Times. Strzhalkovsky is not currently on the E.U.’s list of oligarchs sanctioned as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but locals in the northern Norway port city of Narvik said they’re taking their own measures. “Why should we help them?” Sven Holmlund, an oil supplier, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. “They can row home. Or use a sail.” Norwegian politicians have urged confiscation of the custom-built vessel, but a government official told NRK the law prevents such action without an E.U. directive. The yacht’s captain, meanwhile, has decried his predicament, insisting the crew is “Western” and blameless in Russia’s war. “We find the discrimination towards us extremely unjust,” the captain, Robert Lankester, wrote in a message shared by NRK and NPR. The Ragnar’s stranding comes as the U.S government on Wednesday announced its own effort to “seize and freeze” the assets of Russian elites allied with Putin. The Treasury Department’s partial list of 50 individuals sanctioned by the U.S. and other jurisdictions does not include Strzhalkovsky’s name. The Ragnar flies the flag of the Yacht Club of Monaco, which hails the vessel as “a superyacht like no other.” It features an icebreaker hull and is outfitted for polar exploration. Other amenities include a helideck, swimming pool, gym, “a BigBo amphibious ATV, heli-skiing equipment, four See-Doos, four ski scooters, six Seabobs, a multipurpose island and a giant slide,” the magazine Boat International reported in a 2020 feature article. Strzhalkovsky reportedly received a golden parachute payout of $100 million in 2012 when he stepped down as CEO of the Norilsk Nickel mining company after four years. At the time, the severance was the largest ever awarded in Russia. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/19/2022,"The U.S. Defense Department has observed Russian forces stalling out in their advance as well as anecdotal instances of sagging morale among the troops. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby hesitated to comment on the broad morale of the Russian forces, but he acknowledged some ""anecdotal indications"" that morale is ""not high in some units."" AMERICAN CITIZEN KILLED IN UKRAINE, STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS: LIVE UPDATES ""Some of that is, we believe, a function of poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their mission and objectives, and I think disillusionment from being resisted as fiercely as they have been,"" Kirby explained. ""But, again, I want to stress that these are anecdotal accounts."" ""While we’re confident in what we’re picking up, we would not apply that to the entire force that Russia has put into Ukraine,"" he added. RUSSIA INTENDS TO GO FURTHER THAN UKRAINE, MUST STOP ‘DIPLOMACY OF DECEPTION’: FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER Reports over the past week have indicated a significant slowdown in Russian advance, which may contribute to the anecdotal low morale: Officials have not seen Russia move its artillery ""any closer"" to Kyiv, but that all signs indicate that the forces intend to conduct a siege of the city. ""That’s what you want to use artillery for, and so we haven’t seen that manifest itself,"" Kirby told reporters Thursday. ""We’re just seeing them move them into place, but they clearly are trying, particularly around Kyiv, to improve their ability to hit the city from afar with munitions."" SWITCHBLADE DRONES US SENDING TO UKRAINE MAY BE ‘GAME CHANGERS’ Additionally, Defense officials have seen no changes in either air superiority or indication of an imminent amphibious invasion. ""We haven’t seen any major changes by either Air Force in terms of how much they’re flying, but I just don’t have the numbers,"" Kirby said, but he did say that officials had seen ""several surface ships, about a half a dozen or so surface ships off the coast not far from Odesa."" ""They are definitely at sea and not far from Odesa, but it’s unclear right now what they’re planning to do, what they’re preparing to do,"" he added. ""We got frigates, a couple of vantage sips, one warfare ship … but we’re not seeing imminent activity that would indicate that they’re about to launch an amphibious assault on Odesa.""",World/Fox News,"Russian artillery closing in on Kyiv for siege, US says, with troop morale flagging",https://news.yahoo.com/russian-artillery-closing-kyiv-siege-210941727.html
