4/12/2022,"Since becoming chancellor, Rishi Sunak has not delivered any of the tub-thumping speeches of his predecessors about going after tax avoiders. He has not criticised tax havens in the House of Commons. And his only mention of offshore has been in relation to wind power. On one level, this is not surprising. Sunak is a former hedge fund manager, whose previous employers – Theleme Partners and TCI – are both linked to the Cayman Islands. Before that, he worked for Goldman Sachs, masterminds of financial engineering. However, this has very much not been his image since taking over at the top of the Treasury. He was until recently in favour with the public for the furlough scheme saving jobs and livelihoods during the pandemic. He has also found himself in the difficult position for a self-proclaimed “low-tax” Tory of moving to put up taxes. And Sunak’s personal image has been more the California tech bro, working nerdily on his laptop in casual clothes, than the besuited hedge fund boss. This is perhaps why Tory MPs and the public alike have been taken by surprise by recent revelations about his family’s tax arrangements. It is widely known that he married into an exceptionally wealthy family, with Akshata Murty’s father an Indian IT billionaire. But even Boris Johnson has admitted being unaware that Sunak’s wife was a non-dom, and able to take advantage of this status to legally avoid tax on millions of pounds in overseas earnings. Further revelations that Sunak held a US green card, denoting permanent residence in the States, also appear to have caught No 10 unawares. However, the clues about Sunak’s worldview were there all along. When he backed Brexit in 2016, his models for corporate success and trading partners were the US, India and Brazil. And when he was extolling the virtues of a “clean break” exit from Brussels in 2017, advocating with fellow Tory MPs in the Telegraph, he was praising the ability to sweep away regulation, and create low-tax zones for businesses. He wants to turn the UK in a “global hub” for crypto – despite warnings from the Bank of England governor that the asset class is the “new front line for scammers”. Sunak also brought in a new low-tax scheme that is partly designed to benefit some wealthy non-dom investors – just days before his national insurance rise hit millions of working people at the height of a cost of living crisis. The new scheme – the qualifying asset holding company regime – specifically mentions fund manager non-doms as a category of people who can benefit by not having to pay tax on foreign earnings through the new vehicles. The point of the whole scheme is to try to attract asset managers from low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Luxembourg. In the view of Richard Murphy of Tax Research UK, this is a first step towards “Singapore-on-Thames” in a post-Brexit Britain, the goal being to “encourage the flow of funds through a jurisdiction with little or no tax being paid”. Furthermore, when confronted with the evidence of tax avoidance from reporting by the Guardian, the BBC and others on the huge leak of the offshore Pandora papers, Sunak has been dismissive. Last year, he argued it was “not a source of shame” that London has been called the tax avoidance capital of the world because the UK had a good track record and “led the world” on transparency. And now he is at the centre of calls for transparency about his own family’s financial affairs. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to hold off revealing what he owns and how much tax he pays on it, while in charge of a UK tax policy at a time when many millions are struggling.",News/Politics,Sunak’s worldview is more hedge fund manager than tech bro,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/sunaks-worldview-is-more-hedge-fund-manager-than-tech-bro
4/12/2022,"Police teams that specialise in investigating rape must be set up across England and Wales and independent legal advice must be offered to victims and survivors facing demands for their digital devices, a parliamentary committee has concluded. In an examination of why rape prosecutions are falling, the home affairs select committee found that the unacceptably low numbers of prosecutions for rape and sexual offences will continue without major reforms to the criminal justice system. Reforms should include setting up police rape teams in each force which have been shown to speed up inquiries and improve communication with victims, according to a report released today. The government should also make the provision of independent legal advice a higher priority, particularly for victims facing “unnecessary, excessive requests” for information on their mobile phones, the MPs said. This latest report comes weeks after a joint inspection by two government watchdogs identified multiple failings in the process from the reporting of a rape through to the potential trial and conviction of an assailant. In the year to September 2021, there were 63,136 rape offences recorded – an all-time high – yet only 1.3% of recorded rape offences assigned an outcome resulted in a charge or summons. The number of completed rape prosecutions has dropped from 5,190 in 2016-17 to 1,557 in 2020-21, the report said. Diana Johnson MP, the chair of the committee, said the collapse in the number of prosecutions for rape and sexual offences over the last five years was “truly shocking and completely unacceptable”. “From now on, the focus must be on supporting the victims. Reporting an incident should be the beginning of getting justice but instead has become a source of further pain. The fact that even now nearly two-thirds of cases collapse because a victim may not be able to bear going forward is unimaginable. “Specialist support needs to guide victims throughout the process and improved counselling to deal with the long-term effects. We strongly urge the government to further pilot the provision of independent legal advice to victims and survivors grappling with requests from the police to access data from their phones or third-party material,” she said. The report called for the government to work with policing bodies to ensure specialist police rape teams can be put in place across all police forces. “Despite the difference these teams make – including more timely investigations and improved communication both with victims and the CPS – a recent freedom of information request submitted by the Guardian found that at least two-fifths of police forces in England and Wales do not have them set up,” the report said. Victims and survivors face demands for their data which can lead to some cases collapsing, the report said, and they should be offered independent legal advice. “A number of organisations highlighted their concerns that the police and the CPS can make what appear to be unnecessary, excessive requests for such data, almost as a matter of course. This can cause delays and the intrusion of privacy that even result in complainants dropping their cases,” the report said. MPs said that reforms must focus on the experience of victims attempting to get justice. Lengthy delays in cases reaching court, harmful evidence-gathering processes and poor provision of support services are turning people away from seeking justice, they said. Programmes intended to improve performance in each of these areas are still at the pilot stage and will require improved funding to be rolled out nationally. Counselling needs to be accessible to all victims and survivors, the report concluded. While increased funding for Independent Sexual Violence Advisers was welcomed, the report said there was not enough support in place for counselling and therapy in the long-term. Jayne Butler, the chief executive of Rape Crisis, said the report emphasised that the criminal justice system was categorically failing rape victims and survivors, and that steps from the government to rectify the situation lacked ambition and funds. “We are encouraged by the recognition from the committee of the importance of specialist sexual violence and abuse support services as we know that criminal justice is only part of the survivor journey,” she said. “Long-term and specialist support is crucial in ensuring victim and survivor welfare, and this specialist support provision must be available whether a victim or survivor chooses to report or not.”",News/UK news,"Put ‘rape teams’ on all police forces in England and Wales, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/11/put-teams-on-all-police-forces-in-england-and-wales-say-mps
4/12/2022,"A Conservative peer and former Cabinet minister has apologised for getting the number of people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire wrong when speaking during the inquiry. Eric Pickles, who gave evidence last week, incorrectly said 96 people died in the June 2017 blaze. The correct number of victims was 72. In an email to the inquiry afterwards, he apologised for what he said was an “unintended mistake”. Lord Pickles, a former MP for Brentwood and Ongar who was secretary of state for communities and local government between 2010 and 2015, referred to the victims as the “nameless 96 people” when he appeared before the inquiry into the fire on 7 April. In an email published by the inquiry, as a new module of hearings began on Monday, Pickles said that, in preparing to give evidence, he had “other tragedies, including Hillsborough” on his mind. The politician, who was also chair of the Conservative party from 2009 to 2010, wrote that he “misspoke”. In the email, he said: “In my final remarks I misspoke and referenced the 96 people that died in and immediately after Hillsborough. “I apologise to the family and friends of the 72 people who died at Grenfell for this unintended mistake, which was unscripted. “The dead are remembered not as a statistic but with dignity by their families, survivors and all of us.” He asked that the email be published alongside his evidence. In July 2021 a coroner ruled that Andrew Devine, who died aged 55, 32 years after suffering severe and irreversible brain damage at Hillsborough, was unlawfully killed and therefore was legally the 97th victim of the disaster. After Pickles’ remarks, Grenfell United, a group supporting survivors of the fire and the bereaved, criticised Pickles for what it branded his “utter disregard” for victims and called for his removal from government and the House of Lords. In a statement, the group said: “Eric Pickles’ disrespect at the inquiry has left us speechless. How dare he refer to our loved ones we lost that night as ‘the 96 nameless’. Seventy-two people died in Grenfell and none of them were nameless. “His utter disregard for what happened and to those no longer with us is horrifying, given that he had the ability as minister of housing to reform building safety.” The group added: “Eric Pickles must be removed from government and the Lords. Otherwise, government continues to show the contempt it’s always had for people’s safety in this country.” Pickles also appeared to become frustrated with how much of his time the inquiry was taking up last week, as he gave a second day of evidence. Speaking to Richard Millett QC, the lead counsel to the inquiry, he said: “By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like, but could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in.”",News/UK news,Conservative peer apologises for Grenfell fire victims blunder,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/conservative-peer-apologises-for-grenfell-fire-victims-blunder
4/12/2022,"The tension is like a tidal wave in Flora Wilson Brown’s dark, seeping play. Two conversations are layered on top of each other, their speech overlapping, secrets biting at their sides. Performed with brilliant control by the three actors, Wilson Brown’s writing pinpoints the giddy brightness of an old friendship, the full-bodied repulsion of an abusive relationship, and the torturous reality of the same person being at the centre of both. Mid-20s friends from university, Hannah and Max (Martha Watson Allpress and Ethan Moorhouse), are driving to a wedding. Rather than sitting side by side, Harry Tennison’s direction has them gad about the stage, chasing and teasing. This dynamism echoes the way they open up to each other, the way people do on a long drive. Weaving between their words and space is Alice (Hannah Khalique-Brown), recording her testimony about a musician who has been grooming her since she was 16. We realise almost immediately, she is talking about Max. Occasional lines are lost as the conversations overlay, but the overall effect is rich and exciting. This is the way real stories are told – messy, multiple strands, all at once. The anguish of Alice’s experience is enhanced by hearing details of Max’s manipulation at the same moment he’s singing along to Abba with his friend, silly, free, and beaming. It outlines her vulnerability; that there are two of them and one of her makes her feel even more alone. As the story unravels, Alice makes clear the things he has ruined for her. More subtle but just as painful is Hannah’s guilt at having let it all happen. This is astute, impressive writing, with thoughtful staging, confident performances, and delicate, rumbling sound design underlining the sharpest moments of horror and gut-punch grief.  At Southwark Playhouse, London, until 16 April.",Arts/Stage,I Know I Know I Know review – astute drama uncovers an abusive relationship,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/11/i-know-i-know-i-know-review-southwark-playhouse-london
4/12/2022,"Benedict Lombe has won this year’s Susan Smith Blackburn prize for female, transgender and non-binary dramatists. In a special presentation at Shakespeare’s Globe in London on Monday night, Lombe was named the winner for her play, Lava, a memoir-monologue that travels from Mobutu’s Democratic Republic of the Congo via post-apartheid South Africa to modern-day London. It is the first time in the history of the award, established in 1978, that the prize has gone to a debut play. Lava was commissioned by the Bush theatre in west London, where it was staged last summer, with Ronkẹ Adékoluẹjo playing a British-Congolese woman who receives an unexpected letter from the British Passport Office that leads her to unravel a mystery. The production, directed by Anthony Simpson-Pike, received a four-star review from the Guardian’s Kate Wyver, who admired the way it “weaves lyrical storytelling with untiring protest”. The play was also shortlisted for last year’s Alfred Fagon award for best new play. Lombe, a Kinshasa-born British Congolese writer and theatre-maker based in London, said that Lava “celebrates Blackness in its fullness, showcasing the joy, the struggle, the beauty, and the resistance that has maintained our survival … I wrote it because I wanted to make something that allowed Black people to enter a space and leave taller than when they walked in.” She was one of three UK playwrights nominated for the award: Kae Tempest was shortlisted for Paradise, a reworking of Sophocles’s tragedy Philoctetes at the National Theatre, and Amanda Wilkin was recognised for Shedding a Skin, which recently returned to Soho theatre, London, where it ran last summer. More than 160 plays were nominated for this year’s award. The judges included actor Adjoa Andoh, lighting designer Paule Constable and Justin Audibert, artistic director of the Unicorn theatre in London. Lombe received a cash prize of $25,000 and a signed print by the artist Willem de Kooning. The other nine finalists each received an award of $5,000.

4/12/2022,"Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak of “rank hypocrisy” and questioned the ability of super-rich politicians to relate to the public as No 10 came under pressure to reveal if any other ministers had used schemes to avoid tax. In an interview with the Guardian amid controversy over Rishi Sunak’s wife’s tax status, Starmer said having a spouse who was a non-dom would create a “very obvious conflict of interest” for any cabinet minister. He called on the prime minister to make clear that no other cabinet ministers had taken advantage of non-dom status, used tax havens or benefited from offshore trusts. Sunak has referred himself to the adviser on ministerial interests for an inquiry and his wife, Akshata Murty, last week said she would pay all UK tax on foreign earnings in future. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, also admitted on Sunday to having been a non-dom for six years while a banker, before he was an MP. But despite the continuing public outcry, No 10 on Monday said it could not reveal whether any other ministers or their spouses held or had previously held non-dom tax status. Starmer said the chancellor still had “basic” things to answer about how much tax his family had avoided with Murty’s non-dom status, with estimates she legally avoided paying UK taxes of £20m on overseas earnings. Sunak’s own financial interests are also under scrutiny, as he resisted calls to reveal what assets he has put into a “blind” management arrangement, meaning they can be kept secret from the public. The Lib Dems on Monday wrote to Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, asking her to launch an inquiry into why Sunak had declared no financial interests between 2015 and 2019 as an MP, but then revealed the existence of a blind trust in 2019 when he became a Treasury minister. Sunak has never revealed his wife’s international interests on his list of ministerial interests, although he does declare her holding in the UK-based Catamaran Ventures. She is known to hold about £690m in shares in Infosys, the Indian IT company founded by her billionaire father. The Guardian has also established that Murty has held US investments through a trust in her own name, Akshata Narayana Murty Trust, which is revealed in American filings. Her spokesperson had no comment, apart from that “all rules were followed”. There are also continuing questions around Sunak’s possession of a US green card for permanent residents, including for six years as an MP and government minister. Sunak left his job in the US in 2013, but declared the same year in a UK company filing that he was resident in the UK, suggesting he was giving different information to the British and US authorities about his residency. The US states that green card holders should give up their status if they take up residence elsewhere. Despite warnings that Sunak may have flouted US immigration rules, the chancellor is understood to be heading to Washington next week for International Monetary Fund spring meetings. The row over the tax arrangements of Murty, who has said she has maintained her non-dom status in part because she hopes to return to her birth country of India, has reportedly led Sunak to question his future in UK politics. Asked if there were issues with politicians from a super-wealthy elite becoming prime minister, Starmer said it would be likely to pose problems. “There’s much more likely to be a conflict of interest. I don’t know many people who have signed up to a non-dom scheme in order to increase their tax. It is pretty obvious why people do it.” But he also said there was a “broader issue” about politicians’ disconnection from ordinary people’s lives. “I think that even before we got to the non-dom issue, the chancellor’s response to the spring statement, to the real pressures on people, showed that he just doesn’t get it.” Starmer highlighted Sunak’s own personal wealth – his four homes – and his reference to having four different types of bread in his house, as well as his decision to borrow a Sainsbury’s worker’s ordinary car for a photoshoot, as evidence he was “completely out of touch”. “You know, whether that’s picking up somebody else’s car, whether it’s four loaves of bread in his own family, whether it’s a number of houses, it’s about whether he gets it. It’s about whether you understand, whether you can relate to the very real struggles that people have and the cost of living crisis, and it dominates every discussion we have around the country.” Starmer has so far refused to commit to Labour’s longstanding policy to abolish non-dom status, first announced by Ed Miliband in 2015, but said the party was undertaking an extensive review of the tax system. Speaking to the Guardian on a campaign visit to Sunderland, he hinted that he was uncomfortable with the system of overseas tax status. “Most people don’t get that choice … it’s only a very small minority of people. This has been portrayed as some complex tax situation. It’s not.” Starmer also expressed some hesitation at the idea politicians should publish their own tax returns, saying it was “overcomplicated” and that all proper declarations should be made. But he added: “There is nothing to reveal in my tax returns, [but] I can tell you if I was prime minister, I wouldn’t be going to the country saying I want more tax from you, but secretly I’m reducing my own tax burden through schemes. It’s rank hypocrisy.” Starmer said that he had been hearing deeply worrying stories from voters on the campaign trail about the way that rising energy bills and inflation were affecting their lives. “They are really worried about paying the bills. The most repeated thing said to me, particularly from older people, is that they are not putting the heating on, or sitting in their dressing gown all day, because [they are] too scared to turn up the heating. “Somebody said to me: ‘I don’t put our central heating up higher than 12 degrees.’ Someone last week said to me in the supermarket: ‘Now, I pick things up and then put them back down again and try to get something cheaper.’” He said Labour had a message about “practical ways to deal with the problems” and said people were receptive to his party’s message on taxing the extra profits of oil and gas companies to reduce energy bills. “Of course, we’ve got to show that we are the party to be trusted with the economy, but I think we are doing that.”",News/Politics,Keir Starmer accuses Rishi Sunak of ‘rank hypocrisy’ over tax scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/keir-starmer-accuses-rishi-sunak-of-rank-hypocrisy-over-tax-scheme
4/12/2022,"How does the war end in Ukraine? At the moment it is far from obvious – which is why both sides are girding for a trial of strength in Donbas after Russia was forced to abandon its attempt to capture Kyiv. Russia’s current military activity appears to back up what are in effect reduced war aims: targeting the entire Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts claimed by the so-called separatist republics, both recognised by Vladimir Putin just before the war broke out. An eight-mile convoy, spotted on Friday by satellite imagery, 50 miles east of Kharkiv, is likely to be heading for Izyum, once again bringing to mind one of the early images of the war. Russian forces have been, for several days already, trying to push from Izyum south to Slavyansk, but not so far making much progress. Tracey German, a professor in the defence studies department at King’s College London, said Russia may have already increased the number of battalions in eastern Ukraine “from 30 to 40 in recent days” – and a single front “may be more achievable and could provide Putin with something that can be depicted as a victory”. The belief in the west is that Russia can “double or perhaps even treble” its forces in the Donbas, potentially a decisive shift in Moscow’s favour. Already Russia has stepped up preliminary operations, bombing the quickest supply lines for the forces dug in in the area. The airport in Dnipro, the largest city behind the defensive lines, was destroyed by a Russian attack over the weekend, the local governor acknowledged, while Friday’s cruel missile strike on the railway station in Kramatorsk, an attack that killed more than 50 people, was also intended to disrupt Ukrainian manoeuvrability. Moscow’s problem is whether its already battered forces can carry out the task: 37-38 of its battalions are “combat non-effective” after being harried around Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, according to an estimate from western intelligence on Monday. That leaves Moscow with a total fighting force about 90 battalions strong. At full strength each battalion should have about 800 troops. Elsewhere in the east, Russian forces are getting edging closer to seizing control of Mariupol, cutting the city into two on Sunday, according to the Institute of the Study of War, at a high cost to the attackers and a far more fearful cost to its citizens. “Tens of thousands are dead,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, estimated on Monday, in a speech to the South Korean parliament, although the grim struggle for control of the port city has further demonstrated to Moscow it cannot capture any more of Ukraine’s population centres without high casualties to its own forces. For Ukraine, the problem of the current phase is acute, if no longer existential. Kyiv has shown it can mount effective counterattacks against overextended Russian mechanised forces with western anti-tank weapons – but its forces are also depleted and have not been able to push the Russians back far, if at all, in the south and east. Its focus in the first instance will be trying to stem the Russian advance, to avoid its forces being enveloped in Donbas, and instead grind Russia to a something like a stalemate as both sides become increasingly exhausted after what would be more than two months of fighting. That would nevertheless leave Ukraine largely cut off from the sea, and Russia with a land bridge from Donetsk to Crimea. Ukraine may not be demilitarised as Putin demanded, but its economy is nevertheless devastated, shrunk by an estimated 45% this year, according to the World Bank. President Zelenskiy, however, has repeatedly demanded more and better weapons from the west as he hopes to turn stalemate into victory. So far what’s been offered – in public at least – is not enough to turn the military balance, such as a dozen T-72 tanks from the Czech Republic, 10 Switchblade 600 drones from the US or 120 armoured vehicles from the UK. The question for the west, for whom Ukraine is effectively fighting a proxy war, is whether to step up supplies so that Kyiv can turn the tide on land, force Russian forces out of Kherson near the mouth of Dnieper River in the south, and drive the invaders back elsewhere in the Donbas. The refusal to supply Russian-designed fighter jets from eastern-bloc Nato members suggests the US, in particular, is nervous not just about provoking an unpredictable Kremlin but also about altering the balance too far. A tipping point could be whether Poland is allowed to supply about 100 Russian T-72 tanks it has in its arsenal. It may be a difficult balance to strike. Do Ukraine’s western allies want to give Putin a bloody nose, or simply try to provide enough arms in the hope of forcing a return to the positions before fighting broke out on 24 February? If Ukraine were in a stronger military position, Kyiv might seek to reclaim the Donbas territories occupied since 2014 – where Moscow’s defence may be fiercer.",News/World news,New phase of Ukraine war brings no obvious route to end fighting ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/new-phase-of-ukraine-war-brings-no-obvious-route-to-end-fighting
4/12/2022,"Aminata was feeling “pretty frustrated” as she made her way home from her law studies class. The 19-year-old had been excited to vote for the first time in the French presidential election and had been glued to it on social media, but her candidate, the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, had missed the final by just over one percentage point. “I’m gutted,” she said. She is now one of the millions of Mélenchon-fan kingmakers whose second-round vote could decide the election as Emmanuel Macron tries to win them over in order to hold back the far-right Marine Le Pen. “Not a single vote for Le Pen!” Mélenchon thundered to his supporters after polls showed up to one-third of them might put be tempted to give an “anti-system” vote to Le Pen because they despised Macron. “Of course, I’ll now vote for Macron without a second’s hesitation – not for his platform but to keep out Le Pen, otherwise we’ll drift into far-right dictatorship,” Aminata said. She hoped to work abroad, but if Le Pen was elected she feared having to cut short her studies and leave France straight away. Aminata wears a Muslim headscarf, which Le Pen wants to ban from all public spaces, including the street. “My mum is an accountant, she lived through the difficulties of home-working during Covid and thinks Macron handled that well,” Aminata said. “But I felt Mélenchon was a vote of hope for young people; he was the only candidate with a real anti-racism platform and he came so close.” Mélechon had a historically high score in the département of Seine-Saint-Denis, the traditionally leftwing bastion north of Paris, whose pockets of high-rise estates are among the most deprived in France. Across the whole of Seine-Saint-Denis, Mélenchon took 49% of the vote – far ahead of Macron on 20% and Le Pen on 11%. But it was in the small Seine-Saint-Denis town of Villetaneuse, population 13,000, that Mélenchon reached one of the highest national scores: 65%. Its residents were now mulling over what to do. Aliya, 19, a law student who had voted Mélenchon alongside her mother, a district nurse, would now choose Macron in order to block Le Pen. “It’s a no-brainer – Le Pen’s anti-immigration programme against foreigners is unconstitutional, and runs counter to people’s religious freedoms to wear a headscarf. I’ll vote Macron to keep Le Pen out and everyone I know will do the same.” The youth vote will be crucial over the next two weeks. Mélenchon came top among 18-24-year-olds in France, taking 31% support. Young people’s second favourite candidate was Le Pen, with 26%, followed by Macron with only 20%. But low turnout among 18-24s will be a key factor in the second round – 42% of young people failed to vote in the first round and it remains to be seen whether they will now mobilise. “I’m worried about people not bothering to turn out to vote in the final round,” said Amin, 24, outside a supermarket. “I voted Mélenchon because he was fighting for equality and there were a load of racists running for president,” he said, referring to Le Pen and the far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour. “I’m wondering what to do myself, whether to vote Macron or just a blank ballot.” Turnout in Seine-Saint-Denis as a whole had been historically low in the first round – 30% of people didn’t vote, and Amin feared they wouldn’t mobilise. It was Macron’s Covid vaccine pass that had upset him, which had been required for entry to cafés, restaurants and a host of public spaces, with the centrist president saying he wanted to put the non-vaccinated “in the shit”. Amin had a long-term health condition that meant he could not get vaccinated, and was also vulnerable to Covid. “I felt stigmatised,” he said. Being a student in lockdown was difficult, he had dropped out of engineering and recently switched to a communications course, as he raises a young baby with his student partner, “which is also very hard”. His father, who works on building sites, also voted Mélenchon. “I think I’ll have to vote Macron in the end because the far-right rhetoric of this campaign has been very hateful and virulent. That risks leaving its mark on a country as diverse as France.” Ishika, 18, a university student, said she had voted for Le Pen, despite most of her friends choosing Mélenchon. Her parents were originally from Mauritius and her pro-Macron father, who worked in a car-hire firm, had tried to persuade her against the far right. “Marine says that no one under 30 would pay income tax, which I agree with,” she said. “I also do think France has let in too many foreigners.” She was angry with Macron over the Covid vaccine pass. “I didn’t want to get vaccinated, so for ages couldn’t go the gym or restaurants,” she said. But she completely disagreed with Le Pen’s ban on the Muslim headscarf. “That is stigmatising – but it’s also so far-fetched that I don’t think she’ll be able to actually ever carry that out.” Myriam 19, a law student, had also voted Le Pen. Her brother voted Mélenchon and tried to persuade her against Le Pen because their Algerian grandmother in Seine-Saint-Denis wears the hijab. “But I don’t think Le Pen is as bad as everyone says,” she said. “And I don’t think she’ll really go as far as banning headscarves.”",News/World news,Mélenchon fans in his Paris bastion weigh up their options,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/melenchon-fans-in-his-paris-bastion-weigh-up-their-options
4/12/2022,"Fresh claims have emerged regarding the incident which contributed to the omission of Mike Brown and Ben Te’o from Eddie Jones’s squad in the lead-up to the 2019 Rugby World Cup and effectively brought both players’ international careers to an abrupt close. England’s long-time full-back Brown, who is now playing at Newcastle Falcons, has gone public for the first time on what he says sparked the well-publicised spat during England’s training camp in Italy before the tournament. Among his allegations is that a third player, Maro Itoje, unintentionally fuelled the situation during a boozy team social gathering. According to Brown, Itoje was in high spirits and was going around “whacking people in a fun, jovial way”. Brown, however, was not amused – “He hit me very hard [on my chest], hard enough to leave a massive handprint” – and says Te’o spotted his frustration. “Ben kind of cottoned on to that and then for the rest of the time decided he would try and wind me up,” Brown told RugbyPass’s Jim Hamilton in a Rugby Roots interview looking back on his career. “It was unfortunate really. We’d had a really intense two-week period in Treviso in our World Cup camp. The training was the toughest I’ve ever experienced in my life and we hadn’t done too much socially away from it. Some guys had a few too many.” At one stage, Brown alleges, Te’o stumbled over a table and knocked over some drinks which prompted two younger players to intervene and ask him to chill out. “I don’t think he liked that because they were two young guys and it wound him up a bit,” Brown said. “So then we left, early evening, late afternoon, to get on the coach. I can hear him in front of me with a group of lads. He’s going ‘I’m going to knock him out on the bus, I’m going to do this to him, I’m going to that to him’. I was like: ‘Te’o, I’m stood right behind you. What’s your problem?’ “He kind of walks back to me and we meet and he’s just swung for me. He’s done a lot of boxing, he’s a big lad and he clipped me well. We just kind of came together and everyone kind of dove in and broke it up. I didn’t get near him. That’s basically what happened.” Jones ended up dropping both players from his squad, which went on to reach the final, despite Brown’s insistence he was mostly blameless. “Eddie didn’t take kindly to that. He didn’t speak to me from the moment it happened … I felt a bit let down because not many lads said: ‘Mike didn’t actually really do much. It was instigated by other people.’ “I didn’t feel like anyone really had my back. People were looking after themselves because it was close to a World Cup and I kind of understand that. [But] that wasn’t the reason why I didn’t go to the World Cup. I think it was just easier for Eddie to put it on that.” The Rugby Football Union has declined to comment while Itoje’s club Saracens have yet to respond to Brown’s allegations. Meanwhile, a review by New Zealand Rugby into the management of the national women’s team, the Black Ferns, has concluded there was no “clear or consistent high-performance vision, practices or mindset” but the head coach, Glenn Moore, is to stay in his post ahead of the World Cup later this year. Munster are set to confirm the former England international Graham Rowntree as their new head coach.",Sport/Sport,Brown reveals his take on row at end of England career before 2019 World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/mike-brown-reveals-his-take-on-row-at-end-of-england-career-before-2019-world-cup
4/12/2022,"The Metropolitan police has been refused permission for a “hopeless” appeal against a high court ruling that found the force breached the rights of organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard in south London last year. Reclaim These Streets (RTS) proposed a socially distanced gathering in Clapham Common to mark the death of the 33-year-old marketing executive, who was murdered by a serving Met officer. The group were forced to cancel the official event because the police said it would be illegal for them to stage it under lockdown restrictions. The Met told RTS they would face fines of £10,000 each alongside possible prosecution if it went ahead. However, hundreds of people attended an unofficial vigil led by the direct action group Sisters Uncut. It led to clashes between officers and protesters, and accusations of heavy-handed policing. The RTS founders Jessica Leigh, Anna Birley, Henna Shah and Jamie Klingler argued that decisions made by the Met in advance of the planned vigil amounted to a breach of their human rights to freedom of speech and assembly. In a high court ruling in March, their claim was upheld by Lord Justice Warby and Mr Justice Holgate, who found that the Met’s decisions in the run-up to the event were “not in accordance with the law”. After considering a paper application by the Met to challenge the ruling at the court of appeal, the judges refused permission. They said in a court order: “There were factual issues in this case which we resolved by reference to established principles. “It is not arguable that we erred in principle and see no other reason to believe that the court of appeal would be prepared to adopt a different factual analysis.” The judges also said some of the Met’s proposed grounds of appeal were “hopeless attempts to challenge reasoned factual conclusions”, while others involved “a misreading of one passage of the judgment, ignoring the overall context”. The Met could still pursue a challenge by asking the court of appeal to grant permission. In a summary of the ruling last month, Lord Justice Warby said: “The relevant decisions of the [Met] were to make statements at meetings, in letters, and in a press statement, to the effect that the Covid-19 regulations in force at the time meant that holding the vigil would be unlawful. “Those statements interfered with the claimants’ rights because each had a ‘chilling effect’ and made at least some causal contribution to the decision to cancel the vigil. “None of the [Met’s] decisions was in accordance with the law; the evidence showed that the [Met] failed to perform its legal duty to consider whether the claimants might have a reasonable excuse for holding the gathering, or to conduct the fact-specific proportionality assessment required in order to perform that duty.” Everard’s killer, Wayne Couzens, 49, was given a whole-life sentence, from which he will never be released, at the Old Bailey in September after admitting to the murder. The policing of the vigil drew criticism from across the political spectrum after footage emerged of officers forcibly holding women on the ground and leading them away in handcuffs. A report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services concluded that the Met had “acted appropriately” when dealing with the event.",News/UK news,High court denies Met permission to challenge ruling on Sarah Everard vigil,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/high-court-denies-met-permission-to-challenge-ruling-on-sarah-everard-vigil
