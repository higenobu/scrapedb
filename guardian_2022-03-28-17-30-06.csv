3/28/2022,"Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, the husband and wife musicians who were core members of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, have survived a serious car crash after a collision with a drunk driver. According to a post from Frantz on Facebook, accompanying an image of their wrecked Ford SUV, the incident happened two weeks ago on US Route 1. He wrote: We were struck head on by a drunk driver who was driving on the wrong side of the road. Incredibly, we walked away from the collision. Tina had a Cat scan and suffered three fractured ribs and a fractured sternum. She’s been in a lot of pain but she will get better with time. I give thanks to our guardian angels and to the Ford Motor Company for building a car that protected us from getting killed. A representative for Weymouth told Pitchfork that she was “a bit banged up in the accident but is resting and doing well. With the type of injury she had, rest is a key part of the recovery process. Chris is taking good care of her.” On drums and bass respectively, Frantz and Weymouth were the rhythm section of Talking Heads, who blended a range of styles including punk, funk and rock before crossing over into the US pop mainstream with hits including Burning Down the House and Road to Nowhere. The pair, who married in 1977, also formed Tom Tom Club in 1981, a funk and new wave group known for songs such as Wordy Rappinghood and the much-sampled Genius of Love.

3/28/2022,"Police have urged people not to enter flood waters in south-east Queensland, where one man and five dogs died, and another person was swept away. During a day of heavy rain, a man and five dogs died before 5am on Monday after a vehicle and trailer belonging to a pet-moving business was caught in flood waters near Kingsthorpe, north-west of Toowoomba. A woman, who was the driver, was rescued from the vehicle, but a male passenger died. Police on Monday said an “extensive search and rescue” was also under way for a man swept away near North Branch in the Southern Downs. Emergency services were called before 7am when two vehicles became stuck in flood waters at a crossing with Spring Creek. Members of the public helped rescue one of the drivers, but a man in his 40s tried to get out of his vehicle and was swept away. Both the rescued woman and missing man were the sole occupants of their vehicles. Acting inspector Kim Hill said in the period since 6pm Sunday night, police had received eight calls for assistance in the Darling Downs area for people who had “found themselves in danger after entering flood waters”. “This morning police and swift water rescue have undertaken three rescues of people from vehicles stuck in flood waters,” Hill told reporters on Monday. The man killed near Kingsthorpe was the 14th to die in flood waters in Queensland over the last six weeks. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Disaster Management Coordination superintendent, John Bosnjak, said “some people just don’t seem to listen” to the warnings of emergency services. “Some people have been very unlucky, driving at night into flooded water, being washed away into rapid waters,” he said. “Other people have just made very poor choices and end up losing their life.” Their pleas for people to avoid flood waters came as much of south-east Queensland braced for flash flooding. David Grant, a Bureau of Meteorology emergency management meteorologist said on Monday that a severe weather warning stretched from Noosa south to the border and inland towards Warwick, including the Scenic Rim and the Lockyer Valley. He said the rain event could bring short bursts of rainfall in the order of 100mm to 150mm over a three to six-hour period, with localised thunderstorms bringing dumps of more than 200mm in that time frame. He said this event was “very different” to the deadly event which triggered Queensland’s wettest February in 130 years. “Although our rainfall totals won’t reach the magnitudes of what we did see in the last event, we have to be mindful that our catchments are very wet from that last event and therefor won’t take as much rainfall to see very rapid responses in a lot of our creeks and streams,” Grant said. Residents in the Darling Downs town of Dalby were on high alert, with flood waters expected to threaten low lying parts of the town overnight on Tuesday. On Monday morning, the town’s caravan park was evacuated for the second time this year.",News/Australia news,‘Don’t seem to listen’: authorities urge Queenslanders to avoid flood waters after death toll rises,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/dont-seem-to-listen-authorities-urge-queenslanders-to-avoid-flood-waters-after-death-toll-rises
3/28/2022,"“Within a few years owning a car,” writes Bryan Appleyard in this entertainingly forthright history, “might seem as eccentric as owning a train or a bus. Or perhaps it will simply be illegal.” Although Appleyard’s intention is to document a way of life that he believes is passing, his book is not a lament or a eulogy, nor really a celebration, but instead an acknowledgment of the extraordinary cultural and environmental impact the car has had on this planet in the last 135-plus years. We have shaped our lives, our cities, our worlds around the needs and possibilities of internal combustion engine vehicles. And nowhere has this global trend been more conspicuously evident than in the US, a nation whose rise, supremacy and incipient decline closely match the fortunes of the motorcar. In a book that almost delights in the contradictions wreaked by the automobile, one of the more glaring paradoxes is that while the author focuses on America, he is no fan of the cars it has produced – with very few exceptions. With that discrimination established, it is thankfully not a work specifically aimed at petrolheads and is thus largely free of discussions of camshafts and torque. Instead Appleyard approaches cars through the people who made them – not the assembly-line workers, but the factory owners and designers. After a few preliminaries, the story really begins with two contrasting, though equally paradoxical, figures: Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan. The men behind Ford and General Motors, for much of the 20th century they presided over the two biggest car manufacturers in the world. Ford was an unpredictable, idiosyncratic visionary who brought all his considerable energy to bear on producing the most utilitarian car imaginable: the Model T. Sloan was a far less colourful – almost faceless – businessman whose success was based on diversification, imaginative marketing and stylistic flourishes. It was as if their insights were the opposite of their characters. Yet despite their different approaches, Ford and GM were equally complacent when it came to foreign competition. For several decades, their shared sense of superiority was understandable. Despite producing some wonderful cars, European manufacturers never made much headway in the American market. It’s sobering to be reminded that in 1932 Britain was the world’s largest car manufacturer and by the 1950s was the world’s biggest car exporter. But for all its engineering strengths, the UK failed to invest and innovate in manufacturing processes and became increasingly subject to disastrous industrial action. While Germany fared much better, as Volkswagen cornered the small car market, and BMW, Audi and Mercedes dominated the executive end, it was Japan that revolutionised car manufacturing. In the process it left Detroit – Motor City itself – fighting for its life. As sharply as he draws portraits of the key players, Appleyard, one of the liveliest minds in journalism, is at his most acute when musing on the cultural effects of the car. When four wheels replaced the horse as the main mode of transport, people were still severely restricted in their movements. Particularly in America, the world beyond major cities was not easily accessible. Paved road systems changed that. The roads were paved because that’s what cars required and, equally, cars were built to fill the paved roads. All of this circular activity brought city dwellers into contact with the great outdoors, the “unspoilt” wilderness beyond city limits. But of course the building of roads, and the cars they bore, encroached on the wilderness, spoiling the very nature that drivers and their passengers wanted to savour. Part of the automobile’s attraction was the autonomy it offered to individuals, the sense of freedom of movement, of personal liberty, a freedom whose cost we are only now really counting. This is the strange mental condition that the car helps foster, an idea of individual liberty that is curtailed only by others, never ourselves; it’s why we see traffic jams as something thrust upon us, rather than a whole of which we form an active part. Another way that cars have affected our sense of space is in the emotional draw of imagined destinations – the existential lure of the road trip. Somewhere out there, cars seem to suggest, is an authentic reality that, if we could only drive for long enough, we could find. As Appleyard wryly observes: “There is a popular conviction, first, that America in particular is a country that needs looking for and, second, that it cannot be found.” Appleyard has plenty more zingers where that one came from. In the first half of the book, they help animate a fast-moving narrative of industrial development, but in the second half they’re more often employed to disguise the fact that the story has run out of road. So economically and brightly does Appleyard establish the main plot points of the automobile’s progress and then crisis that after the halfway point he is increasingly reliant on revisiting popular culture to make his invariably witty points. Perhaps the car’s gradual automated demise is too dull and unromantic to engage his creative imagination. Or maybe pondering the meaning of celebrity car deaths or commenting on the inefficacy of drive-by shootings is just more engaging than considering the algorithm-shaped future. Weighing up the ecstatic freedoms and the remarkable convenience the car has brought against the death and destruction it has also delivered, Appleyard finishes on a note of anticipated nostalgia. All the many driven car designers and manufacturers, he concludes, “made a way of life that was worth living”.

3/28/2022,"It’s a frustrating time to be a saver. Inflation has reached its highest level in three decades, while banks have been very slow to pass on the three rises in interest rates since December. As the deadline approaches for investing this year’s Isa allowance, how can you best protect your money from rising prices? The answer is not in cash Isas, now typically paying less in interest than regular savings accounts. With consumer prices rising by 6.2%, the stock market might be the best chance of inflation-beating returns. But where to invest and how? Some aim specifically to beat the rate of inflation. The Trojan Fund, from Troy Asset Management, comes recommended by Hargreaves Lansdown. It is based on four “pillars” of investment: large established companies it thinks can grow long term; government bonds; gold-related investments, and cash. In the last year it is up 12%, with an 0.86% charge which Damien Fahy, of finance site Money to the Masses, says is “reasonable”. Tracker funds, also known as index funds, track a broad market or a segment of a market. AJ Bell’s Laith Khalaf says they are a simple, low-cost option which can give instant diversification. He recommends the Fidelity Index World Fund, which has an annual charge of 0.12%. “There is no special inflation strategy, you’re just investing in the whole market and relying on rising share prices to lift your returns above inflation in the long term,” he says. “One risk of this approach is that currently around two thirds of the global stock market is made up of US companies, so you’ll have a lot of eggs in one regional basket.” It is up 14.9% in the last year. The commitment to slow climate change, and a shift to more sustainable energy systems, has created possibilities, says Rob Morgan at wealth management firm Charles Stanley. He highlights Schroders’ Global Energy Transition Fund, which aims to invest in between 30 and 50 companies focused on moving to a low-carbon economy. Those involved in nuclear energy and fossil fuels are excluded. After growing 143% between 2020 and 2021, it is down 10.3% in the last year. Morgan says: “They are specialist and could be quite volatile, so should only be in small positions in a broader portfolio, and are definitely for holding on to for the long term.” Guinness leads the market in stout and has, historically, raised prices in line with the wages of manufacturing workers – giving owner Diageo a distinctive brand with loyal customers. Companies like this can be well positioned in an inflationary world, says Jason Hollands of Bestinvest, and he points to funds investing in similar companies resilient to changes in the economic environment. The Liontrust UK Growth Fund is up 12.6% on the last year, with a recurring charge of 0.84%. It has 5% in Diageo and 6.6% in healthcare giant AstraZeneca. The TB Evenlode Income Fund is up 9.04% on last year, and has a recurring charge of 0.87%. It holds 8.2% in Diageo and 8.1% in consumer goods giant Unilever. Check the fact sheet on the providers’ websites – it will list the biggest holdings. Value investing involves picking stocks seen to be trading at below their book value. Dzmitry Lipski, head of fund research at Interactive Investor, says value stocks have the ability to increase profits above inflation and pay steady or rising dividends. Warren Buffet is seen as the leading investor in the field. Artemis SmartGARP Global Equity Fund aims to invest in attractively valued companies, says Lipski, trading “at a lower valuation than they are intrinsically worth”. It is up 9.48% on last year, with a charge of 0.89%. Gold is often seen as the “safe haven” investment and, as a result, tends to thrive when the rest of the world is faltering. The last year has seen its value rise by almost 17% – but it is volatile. Fahy highlights the Ninety One Global Gold Fund, which invests in the shares of companies involved in gold mining. It is up 18.7% in the last year with a charge of 0.84%. “That is different from actually investing in gold, and gold-mining stocks can be even more volatile, especially if the price of gold falls,” he says. Although the Isa deadline is fast approaching, you don’t have to commit all of your money to the stock market now. Sarah Coles of Hargreaves Lansdown says: “You can open a stocks and shares Isa on the platforms, then gradually drip-feed cash into stock market investments when it suits you.” This has the potential advantage of avoiding losses if there is a fall, says Fahy. “Investors acquire more units/shares for their money as they drip in, perhaps using equal regular monthly instalments on the way down, boosting their return when markets eventually recover,” he says. However, a study from Vanguard showed that lump-sum investing beat the drip-feed method over a 10-year period. “The message is, you can’t predict the market, and if you are investing for the long term, time in the market is usually more important than timing your entry,” says Fahy.  There are four types of Isas – cash; stocks and shares; innovative finance and lifetime.  Your £20,000 Isa allowance can be put into one type, or split. The limit for a lifetime Isa is £4,000 a year.  You don’t have to pay tax on interest earned, or income from investments  You must save or invest by 5 April each year. The unused allowance does not roll over.  Investing in funds can, typically, be done directly, through a broker or advisor, or through one of the numerous online investment platforms.",Lifestyle/Money,How to find which way the wind is blowing for the best Isa returns,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/28/how-to-find-which-way-the-wind-is-blowing-for-the-best-isa-returns
3/28/2022,"The Trinidad-born British designer and artist Althea McNish’s bold textile prints rescued 1950s Britain from postwar gloom, ushering in the upbeat 60s with outsize flowers in a humid palette. Her early work with forward-thinking fabric producers such as Liberty, Ascher Ltd and Hull Traders brought Caribbean heat into British living rooms, while Christian Dior and Balenciaga used her pop-bright prints on floaty silk dresses. “She layered two unique identities,” says Rose Sinclair, the co-curator of Colour Is Mine, a long-overdue, posthumous survey of McNish’s 70-year career. “In terms of the Black influence on British culture, her textiles say it loud and clear.” A photo of McNish from 1966 suggests her reach. She’s in her studio, behind a desk laden with pots and brushes, while hectic mood boards cover the walls. Shot from below with her head turned, mid-conversation, it is an empowering image that casts her as a busy career woman and an aspirational figure for readers of the publication that commissioned it: the Daily Mail. The portrait ran with a story on McNish’s contribution to that year’s Ideal Home Show, a “bachelor girl’s room” for the metropolitan twentysomethings busily dismantling traditional female roles. At the other end of the scale, McNish clothed the Queen for her official visit to Trinidad and Tobago that February. As Sinclair puts it: “She’s a rare Black woman within international textile history. She broke boundaries.” McNish had a far steeper hill to climb than her peers. “She was decorating the domestic space, up and down the country, at a time when the frame for a lot of Black people was: ‘You should go back home,’” the curator says. “She changed the spaces that people inhabited.” The forthcoming retrospective is set to reveal a life full of luminous firsts. McNish originally came to Britain in her late 20s to undertake an architecture degree, which she gave up in favour of printmaking. She completed her studies at the Royal College, although Sinclair credits evening classes with the pioneering pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi for first introducing McNish to textiles’ potential. Her technical prowess was unusual, creating multilayered prints whose complexity is nigh-on impossible to imitate. “When you’ve got a piece that has 17 screens and colours in it, who’s going to copy it?” asks Sinclair. It was what McNish described as her “tropical eye” that caught the attention of her early champion, Arthur Stewart-Liberty. When a designer’s expected career path meant learning the ropes in someone else’s studio, Liberty took the rare step of commissioning exclusive designs from her as soon as she graduated in 1957. Transforming, as McNish once said, “the flowers of the English countryside [with] tropical flamboyance”, her iconic prints explode with brushy depictions of giant blooms and free-floating foliage. The colours sizzle and ping: rose red against violet, tangerine over deep pink, lime with the perfect turquoise of a still, warm sea. The designer summed up her approach with a simple, uncompromising affirmation: “I’m a citizen of the world and I am multicultural. […] My textiles are the statement of my being.” Golden Harvest, designed for Hull Traders, c1960sThis marks an important moment in the development of McNish’s “tropical eye”. The colourway recalls the lush blue Caribbean ocean, but the print’s harvest grew in England. She was a student picnicking in an Essex wheat field when she had the idea for it. Orina Danasco, 1960 (main picture)This design shows McNish pushing her organic forms into abstraction, and is unusual in its direct use of black. The designer once said: “Grey is a colour I would never use […] Black … has the power in it to do what I want.” Ideal Home Exhibition, 1966This portrait shows McNish in her studio preparing for the exhibition, where she exhibited her “bachelor girl’s room”. Sinclair says: “It was to be designed for the 26-year-old girl about town, [someone] not too flash with money. It is the textiles that make the statement.” Student sketchbook, 1954McNish’s sketchbooks show the breadth of her influences. Kew Gardens was a favourite haunt, but so too was the British Museum, where she studied ancient cultures. As Sinclair says: “Her attitude echoed Trinidad itself and its diversity of cultures. She recognised her own mixed cultural heritage.” Althea McNish: Colour Is Mine is at the William Morris Gallery, London, from 2 April until 11 September.",Arts/Art and design,‘She broke boundaries’: how textile artist Althea McNish made Britain bloom,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/28/she-broke-boundaries-how-textile-artist-althea-mcnish-made-britain-bloom
3/28/2022,"Cinephilia is, not surprisingly, a favourite subject of film directors, and it has a tendency to manifest itself on screen in nostalgic contexts that teeter on uncritical wistfulness. Here, however, Payal Kapadia’s kaleidoscopic, Cannes prize-winning documentary unlatches cinephilia from its fetishistic shackles as it chronicles the wave of student protests that exploded under the nationalist rule of India’s prime minister Narendra Modi. Love for the moving image – and love for artistic creativity – marches hand in hand with the fight for political freedom. Threaded together by fictitious letters between two film students who have ended their intercaste relationship, A Night of Knowing Nothing lends a melancholic intimacy to the 2015 student strike at Kapadia’s alma mater, the Film and Television Institute of India, after Modi’s appointment of a right wing former actor as the university’s new chairman. The dissent is captured in passionate bursts; the juxtaposition of tranquil, domestic dormitory life and cacophonous political shouts accentuate the fervent conviction of the latter. When Muslim and lower-caste students suffer maltreatment, the meaning of a state-funded artistic education is called into question. Culled from a wide range of audiovisual materials including home videos, archival footage, and CCTV recordings, the film adds a textural dimension to the images, most of which are moulded into a grainy, black-and-white analogue look. Tangible tactility is key here: in the opening of the film, students dance together in front of a screen projection of Indian films, and the same swaying bodies pour into the streets, as they stand up to state injustice and police brutality. As their chants reference revolutionary Soviet film-makers – “Eisenstein, Pudovkin ... we shall fight, we shall win” – they breathe new life into the dusty canon of cinema history, translating youthful love for the medium into direct political action and solidarity.  A Night of Knowing Nothing is released on 1 April at the ICA cinema.",Arts/Film,A Night of Knowing Nothing review – kaleidoscopic doc is cinephilia at its best,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/a-night-of-knowing-nothing-review
3/28/2022,"NatWest Group has returned to majority private ownership after it agreed to buy back £1.2bn of shares from the UK government, more than 13 years after the company was bailed out by taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis. The company, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), said it had agreed to make an off-market purchase of 550m shares, or 4.91% of its share capital, from HM Treasury at Friday’s closing price of 220.5p, in a statement to the stock market on Monday. The deal, the fifth since the bailout, will be completed on Wednesday, leaving the government with a 48.1% stake in the banking group, a symbolic moment after more than 13 years of majority state ownership. At the peak, the government owned 84% of the group. Gordon Brown’s government announced the £37bn bailout in October 2008, after the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers caused chaos across the global financial system. As well as RBS, the bailout also included Lloyds TSB and HBOS, which later combined to form Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds bought back the last of its shares from the government in 2017. The path back to majority private ownership has been longer for NatWest Group, which became a symbol of the pre-financial crisis excesses of British banking, after a series of disastrous expansions under chief executive Fred “The Shred” Goodwin, who was later stripped of his knighthood after public ire. The chief executive, Alison Rose, ditched the RBS Group brand in 2020. Rose said on Monday: “Reducing government ownership below 50% is an important milestone for NatWest and a further demonstration of the progress we are making.” The latest NatWest share purchase price represents a loss for the government, which paid an average of 500p a share in 2008. The government’s remaining stake will be worth about £11.9bn at Friday’s closing price. John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury under the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “This sale means that the government is no longer the majority owner of NatWest Group and is therefore an important landmark in our plan to return the bank to the private sector. We will continue to prioritise delivering value for money for the taxpayer as we take forward this plan.” The government had planned to sell the entire public stake in NatWest by 2023-24, but delayed the share sales because of the pandemic. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent budget watchdog, said last week that the government had recouped £134bn from its financial crisis interventions, compared with an outlay of £137bn. That would leave the government with a cash surplus of £17.1bn for the financial crisis measures. However, that does not include the cost of borrowing to fund the bailout, with an estimated £47.7bn in extra debt interest costs, meaning the crisis has cost the government £31bn in cash terms alone.",News/Business,NatWest returns to majority private control as it buys back £1.2bn in shares,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/natwest-buys-back-shares-uk-government-rbs
3/28/2022,"Australia’s Special Air Service regiment was riven by a “culture war” with one faction obsessed by a “pagan warrior ethos” where “killing was a sacrament in itself”, the assistant defence minister, Andrew Hastie, has told Ben Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial. Hastie, a former SAS officer who resigned from the military when he was preselected to run for parliament, has been subpoenaed to give evidence by three newspapers defending a defamation action brought by his former comrade and Victoria Cross recipient Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith alleges their media reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Hastie said that as a new parliamentarian in 2016, he was invited into the office of then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for a one-on-one meeting about general rumours of misconduct by Australian special forces in Afghanistan. “PM please tread cautiously here,” Hastie said he told Turnbull at the time. “I said ‘Serious allegations have been levelled and they have to be answered’.” Hastie served alongside Roberts-Smith on a mission in October 2012 to Syahchow, in Uruzgan province, where the newspapers allege a “blooding” incident took place involving Roberts-Smith. The practice involves a new soldier being initiated into the regiment by being ordered to register their first “kill” on operation – allegedly often of an unarmed prisoner. In their defence claim, the newspapers allege Roberts-Smith ordered another soldier, Person 66, to kill a captive, unarmed Afghan man who’d been taken out into a field. Under cross-examination on Monday, Hastie was asked what he believed had happened at Syahchow. “It’s my view that Person 66 was blooded,” he said. Hastie, on the ground during that mission, said in evidence on Friday he remembered Roberts-Smith’s patrol using an interpreter to “tactically question” a number of Afghans up against a wall. He told the court that after moving to a different part of the compound, he heard the words “shots fired” and “two Ekia” – enemy killed in action – over the troops’ radio, but that he didn’t hear any shots. He said he later saw Person 66 in the compound at Syahchow “standing slightly off from the rest of the patrol looking nervous”. He testified he also saw Roberts-Smith again on the mission. “Mr Roberts-Smith walked past me … and he looked me in the eye and said ‘Just a couple more dead cunts’,” Hastie said. Hastie was present when Roberts-Smith gave an oral debrief of the mission to senior SAS command. He told the court on Friday that Roberts-Smith’s version represented an “alternate universe”. “The reality described by Mr Roberts-Smith was different to the one in actuality.” Hastie said he was disquieted by what had happened at Syahchow and, before deploying in command of an SAS troop the next year, briefed his subordinates on the need to obey the laws of war. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I believed something unlawful had happened at Syahchow in the weeks after, which is why I reinforced with my own troop standards [of adherence to rules of engagement],” he said on Monday. Roberts-Smith has denied the Syahchow allegation. Asked directly during his evidence last year if he had ordered Person 66 to execute a prisoner, Roberts-Smith said: “I did not.” Person 66 began giving evidence late on Monday. He was not asked questions specifically about Syahchow and objected to giving evidence about missions in Afghanistan on the basis of self-incrimination. That objection is currently being considered by Justice Anthony Besanko. Under cross-examination, Hastie told the court the SAS was deeply factionalised during the period of his service, and he was deeply troubled by soldiers adhering to what he described as a “pagan warrior culture”. “I didn’t get on with quite a few people at the regiment at that time. There was something of a culture war going on. “In the warrior culture that was being emphasised at the time … shorn of just-war theory … killing became a sacrament in itself.” Roberts-Smith’s lawyers have repeatedly suggested the allegations against the decorated soldier were from a small group of comrades jealous of his military accolades and prominent public profile. Hastie denied he had been critical of Roberts-Smith to raise his own profile as a parliamentarian or that he had briefed journalists in the hope of receiving positive political coverage. He said the reason he spoke to journalists about the allegations made against the SAS was that journalists had come to him already informed of the allegations – and that he believed the “fourth estate” was necessary to hold government institutions to account. “My view is that the system failed, which is why public interest journalism is important.” During a fraught exchange with Roberts-Smith’s barrister Arthur Moses SC, Hastie rejected repeated assertions he had told people Roberts-Smith “was a war criminal”. “I’ve expressed caution to people … [but] I don’t say war criminal. There are serious allegations of misconduct being made against him. I’ve been very guarded in how I talk to people.” Hastie was repeatedly asked whether he believed Roberts-Smith was a war criminal. “An alleged war criminal, yes, if some of the things that are being said are true, then yes.” The trial continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial: ‘I believed something unlawful had happened’, Andrew Hastie says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/ben-roberts-smith-defamation-trial-i-believed-something-unlawful-had-happened-andrew-hastie-says
3/28/2022,"The Labour MP Dawn Butler said she has been diagnosed with breast cancer following a routine mammogram. Butler said she would be taking time off to recover fully from an operation, but said the prognosis was good because the condition had been detected at a relatively early stage. “Of course, everything stood still as it does when you hear the dreaded C-word – it is a shock but an early diagnosis means that it is something that I will get through and over. The NHS has caught my cancer early, the operation was a complete success, and I will make a full recovery,” the 52-year-old said. “A mammogram saved my life,” she told the BBC. “Without a mammogram, my cancer wouldn’t have been discovered.” Butler, whose mother and sister survived breast cancer, said she had initially shared her diagnosis with her partner and sister-in-law and then suffered a panic attack when she realised she would have to make the news public. Butler, the MP for Brent Central since 2015, said that, while she is a workaholic and loves her role as an MP, she would listen to medical advice and take time to recover. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, paid tribute to her “bravery, strength and determination”, saying: “I am sorry you’re going through this, but know that I, and the whole party, are behind you.” Butler became the first black woman to speak at the Commons dispatch box in 2009, when she was a junior Cabinet Office minister. Last year, people living in the area in which she grew up campaigned for her to be honoured with a blue plaque by the local council. She called the moment it was placed on the building that once housed her father’s bakery “one of the most treasured honours” of her life. In 2020, Vogue magazine named her among its 25 most influential women in the UK, saying she has “consistently spoken up for the underrepresented, and highlighted instances of racial discrimination in society – and politics”. Butler has said she would be taking time away from Westminster so she can recuperate, adding that her staff would keep her constituency office running and that she hoped her absence would be brief. She added: “I want to end my statement by thanking the NHS and everyone who is soldiering through. I have seen first-hand how the NHS is under enormous pressure – the Royal London seemed full, people were waiting on chairs in A&E for beds, the staff were exhausted in the NHS and many were suffering from PTSD. “Covid-19 has taken a lot out of them. So many people have missed appointments (many through no fault of their own), results are delayed and operations postponed. If we are to show our appreciation for the amazing NHS workers and rebuild our health service then we need to properly invest in the NHS, both structurally and in the very people who keep it functioning.”",News/Politics,Labour MP Dawn Butler diagnosed with breast cancer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/28/labour-mp-dawn-butler-diagnosed-with-breast-cancer
3/28/2022,"The ABC should have a guaranteed five-year funding cycle and its budget and board should be at arm’s length from government influence, former competition tsar Rod Sims has said in a speech. Ahead of Tuesday’s budget, when the ABC will have its $84m indexation restored, Sims called for “strong and clear” ABC governance and stable funding for the public broadcaster. “The ABC is a vital institution that should continue essentially as is, and that certainly should not be narrowed in its focus or, worse, privatised,” the former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chief said at the Melbourne book launch of Who needs the ABC? by Matthew Ricketson and Patrick Mullins. “That would represent extremely poor economic and public policy.” “Damage the ABC and Australia is damaged,” he said. The ABC has a triennial-funding cycle that Labor has pledged to extend to five years to safeguard the ABC and the SBS against “arbitrary ideological cuts and political interference”. Since the Coalition came to power in 2014 the ABC has lost $526m in funding, resulting in the loss of 640 jobs, from 4,704 staff to 4,064. Sims’ call for stronger governance, including no tied funding, comes after the Morrison government demanded that the ABC and SBS add a new layer of accountability in the form of new reporting conditions. The move has been blasted by Labor as “regulation by stealth” that could lead to a loss of independence. Sims, who is a professor in public policy at the Australian National University, said there had to be a new process to ensure apolitical board appointments. Several recent appointments to the board were made after the minister bypassed the independent nominations panel. Sims said he couldn’t remember a time when the ABC was under as much strain as it had been in recent years. “The government of the day should seek to nurture the ABC. Who knows, they might even get better coverage, human nature being what it is,” he said. “The book describes at length the growing criticism of the ABC. If I reflect back over my lifetime, I do not remember criticism of the ABC being so prominent or so strong as it seems in recent years.” Sims said the ABC board should also “ensure the ABC is not going out of its way to ‘poke the government in the eye’ unnecessarily”. Journalism held the powerful to account and all of society benefited from it, Sims said, adding that the ABC was more than just its journalism. “With all such public goods there is a certainty that public interest journalism will be under-provided if left to the commercial sector alone,” he said. “Therefore, virtually all nations provide some level of public funding for journalism.”",News/Media,"ABC funding should be safeguarded against government influence, Rod Sims says",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/28/abc-funding-should-be-safeguarded-against-government-influence-rod-sims-says
3/28/2022,"This time in 2020, we watched with horror as the realities of the pandemic and its death toll unfurled. Most hardly dared imagine that effective vaccines might appear in a fraction of the time taken for previous efforts, effectively stemming the pandemic tide. But despite the success of the vaccines in greatly reducing the odds of hospitalisation or death, viral evolution had plenty more to throw at us. The onslaught of highly immune-evasive variants was, for most of us in immunology and virology, unforeseen. We’d come to think of the coronavirus family as being rather more stable – less error-prone in terms of mutations – than many viruses. And we had never before had to roll out relatively new ways of developing vaccines, involving mRNA or recombinant adenoviruses, at this scale and in the heat of battle. Having started out brilliantly, the real-life state of play today is self-evidently suboptimal. The vaccines rapidly induce hugely high levels of protective, neutralising antibodies in most people, but these levels wane within months of each sequential dose. Meanwhile, Omicron and the subvariant BA.2 have managed to mutate almost every amino acid residue targeted by protective antibodies, escaping protection. And so you have the unhappy equilibrium currently endured by the UK: more than 300,000 new cases a day, as of late last week, and a continuing caseload of more than 3 million, with hospital admissions and excess deaths holding steady at a new – high – setpoint. All this despite one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. We are living in a precarious truce imposed through frequent mRNA boosters to keep the viral caseload “manageable”. But there are signs this isn’t sustainable, and that a strategy simply consisting of boosters in perpetuity may not be fit for purpose. Recent case surges in Hong Kong, Denmark and Scotland emphasise the fragility of that balance. And new evidence from the past two years suggests that encounters with different variants of Covid or different vaccine types can alter the effectiveness of later jabs in surprising ways – an effect called immune imprinting. This raises the possibility that booster performance could be even less predictable and effective in the future. Sars-CoV-2 began as a single variant, which we term the Wuhan strain. But we now inhabit a world where no two people share precisely the same exposure history: we have never been infected, or were asymptomatically, mildly or severely infected during any or a combination of the Wuhan to Alpha, Delta, Omicron or BA.2 waves, and we’ve all had somewhere from zero to four doses of diverse vaccines. The combination of these exposures gives each of us a unique immune memory repertoire. Imagine a huge jar of pills of different colours, each especially good for responding to a given present or future variant. Someone whose experience has been an Alpha infection plus three doses of Pfizer may have brilliantly built up lots of green pills at the expense of others. But this is less good for you if the next variant mainly needs yellow pills. It turns out the order and type of exposure can affect how our immune system responds later on. In a recent paper reported in the journal Science, we compared protective immunity between people infected in the first wave with the original strain and in the second wave with the Alpha variant. In second wave-infected people, encounters with an Alpha infection plus two vaccine doses gave lower protective (known as neutralising) antibody responses against the Wuhan and Beta variant, yet higher responses against Delta. Given the number of vaccines and strains, these interactions are unpredictable, but will shape how our immunity holds for future waves. It needs more investigation. These are complex problems demanding careful research, long-term planning, trials and even some intelligent crystal ball-gazing. We must evaluate many approaches. Some places have announced a fourth dose rollout for first generation Pfizer vaccines (which cross-neutralises recent variants, but very suboptimally); some vaccine makers have pivoted to targeting the Omicron spike; others are working on polyvalent vaccines to include several different versions of spike, or clever structural approaches to target those parts of spike that would be the same across all past and future variants, and maybe even across those coronaviruses still awaiting crossover from bats and pangolins. This latter approach is exciting and the subject of recent efforts across many teams, including research trials through the US National Institutes of Health and at Cambridge University. There are also advanced programmes considering intranasal – nose – vaccination to achieve local mucosal immunity, increasing the chances of blocking transmission at that site altogether, and vaccine platforms that could be much more durable. The take-home message is that the pandemic is very much with us and evolving dynamically, with a long, bumpy road ahead. The option to sleepwalk through this, taking automatic-pilot choices based on what was “good enough” in the first wave is one we adopt at our peril. We must look at options besides simply boosting through every successive wave. At a time when the US has cut future vaccine research funding, and the UK also needs to maintain its momentum, this should be an urgent priority.
