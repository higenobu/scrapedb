12/28/2021,"‘Ihave endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea,” begins Charles Dickens in the preface to the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. It is a story so inescapable in British culture that nearly everyone knows about miserly Ebenezer Scrooge learning the value of compassion and kindness after being visited by three ghosts in the early hours of Christmas morning. As well as the popular film adaptations that unfailingly appear on TV over the festive season, stage productions this year include a Jack Thorne adaptation starring Stephen Mangan at the Old Vic, a Mark Gatiss version at the Nottingham Playhouse and an adaptation at the Sherman theatre in Cardiff set in Wales and with a gender-swapped Scrooge.  While many people enjoy the story as a timeless tale of redemption, few think of it as a work of serious political activism, but that was Dickens’s intention. According to Michael Slater, a biographer of the Victorian author, A Christmas Carol is “Dickens’s reaction to the attitude of the government and many of the ruling classes in the 1840s … saying, if the poor couldn’t get work and couldn’t look after themselves, they’d have to go to the workhouses.” This belief was part of a prevailing attitude in Victorian society that the poor were a problem to be dealt with, instead of people to be helped – a belief Dickens vehemently disagreed with. Dickens’s politics were shaped by his own childhood experiences. When his family fell on hard times, he was briefly taken out of school and sent to work in a factory. “He felt a tremendous sense of betrayal and humiliation”, says Slater, “which gave him a hugely powerful identification with the children of the poor, because he’d been there himself.” In 1843, Dickens had initially planned to publish a political pamphlet called An Appeal on Behalf of the Poor Man’s Child, but instead decided to plant “the ghost of an idea” in a festive story. Early in A Christmas Carol, for example, when a charity collector tells Scrooge that many people would rather die than go to a workhouse, Scrooge replies: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.” Modern readers might read this as a nasty character saying an almost cartoonishly nasty thing but in 1843 the phrase “surplus population” was a loaded term used to refer to the poor. “It’s the idea that if a man is born into this world, and his parents can’t look after him, and he can’t look after himself, he is ‘surplus’ … and the sooner he dies, the better,” Slater says. “People were terrified of overpopulation, especially among the poor, and they believed that if people brought children into the world that they couldn’t afford to keep, they were almost committing a crime. This is what Dickens hated, this attitude.” It was an attitude that stemmed from the work of well-known political economists such as Adam Smith, who believed that if everyone acted in their own self-interest, the invisible hand of the market would distribute resources. And taking this idea further was Reverend Thomas Malthus, who in 1798 wrote the controversial book An Essay on the Principle of Population. In it, he argued that population growth would eventually outstrip the food available and it was the natural way of things that the poorest people would starve to death, restoring the balance. “Malthus doesn’t tend to use the term ‘surplus population’ but by the early 1840s, when Dickens uses it there, that term is firmly linked to Malthus’s name. I absolutely think people would tie that comment from Scrooge to Malthus fairly directly,” says Professor Robert Mayhew, the author of several books about Malthus. Later in the story, the phrase “surplus population” is used again, this time by the Ghost of Christmas Present. When Scrooge sees the Cratchit family gathering around Tiny Tim and asks if the boy will live, the spirit invites him to think about “what the surplus is and where it is”, suggesting Scrooge might be more surplus than the sick child. “A Christmas Carol isn’t just a cheery, uplifting tale that we can mimic in various modern ways,” says Mayhew. “It’s a very seriously intended work of moral fiction and, perhaps because we tend to pigeonhole it as a Christmas story, we don’t read just how serious it is.” The message that Dickens had for Victorian Britain is increasingly pertinent, even though we may use different words to describe similar problems, Mayhew believes. “It’s interesting because we’re living right now with unprecedented levels of homelessness and individuals needing the support of food banks. We have the binary between extreme wealth on one hand and those inured to poverty on the other.” You feel the resonance of A Christmas Carol seems to get stronger every year.”",Arts/Books,"A Christmas Carol is not cosy, and its angry message should still haunt us",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/28/a-christmas-carol-is-not-cosy-and-its-angry-message-should-still-haunt-us
12/28/2021,"It has been 10 years since I last stalled a car. I was 18 and drifting across several lanes of an A-road roundabout while my driving test examiner gripped his seat. It was my second attempt at taking the test and my brain had turned into sweaty spaghetti. As I casually cut in front of an HGV, the examiner gasped and demanded I take the next exit. I mirrored, signalled and manoeuvred, found a safe space to pull up, and promptly stalled metres from the curb. I failed – of course I did – and didn’t get back in the driver’s seat in a hurry. I finished school and went to university, always deferring the prospect of booking another test. Years passed, priorities shifted, and even though I kept telling myself that driving is a scourge on the environment, a decade of scrounging lifts from my friends and family has taken its toll.  After one too many nights standing in the rain waiting for the bus, I decided it was time to get back behind the wheel. On a blindingly sunny but bitterly cold autumn morning, I emerge blinking into the light to meet my new instructor, Vikram. I find myself feeling more nervous than I expected as he starts the car. Are people staring at me? Do they think it’s embarrassing that I’m learning so late? He begins by taking me through various safety features with the help of a laminated picture book. I want to tell him that I know all of this already, but I soon realise I actually never knew how to open a car door properly (using the arm that is furthest away from the latch, known as the Dutch reach). After what feels like an eternity of animated diagrams and looking into assorted mirrors, I get behind the wheel, fire up the engine, get into gear – and stall. But Vikram reassures me this is to be expected and, over the next five minutes, I cruise around the block. Despite my approximately 10mph speeds, I return home exhausted yet full of adrenaline. When I meet Vikram again a week later, I am fizzing with fear and excitement. This time, I’m in the driving seat immediately, but the level of concentration needed reduces my communication to a pre-verbal gurgle. I am merely a recipient of Vikram’s calm instruction now, nervously taking him on a slow journey to nowhere. Yet, surprisingly, I don’t falter; I’m in third gear and I feel I could take myself anywhere – as long as Vikram and his dual control pedals were there, too. I keep driving for at least 45 minutes and, despite a police car following us down several streets, it’s a success. I am frustrated that I left it so long before trying again but pleased to be back, giving it another go. Vikram assures me that “smart drivers take less time to pass”, so I should be able to take my test again after only a dozen or so lessons. I’m not sure how much I can buy into that flattery yet – mentally or monetarily – but I feel more sure now that there is a time for everything, and that perhaps 18-year-old me just wasn’t ready. In that spirit, I am re-booking my theory test for the new year, with dreams of driving myself to see friends far and wide by this time in 2022 – without stalling at the first roundabout.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Escape your comfort zone: I am terrified of driving – but behind the wheel I find new confidence,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/28/escape-your-comfort-zone-i-am-terrified-of-driving-but-behind-the-wheel-i-find-new-confidence
12/28/2021,"David Lammy has apologised for nominating Jeremy Corbyn to be Labour leader in 2015 and said he is “staggered” that some individuals with deeply antisemitic views remain in the Labour party. Speaking at this year’s Limmud festival, a Jewish event, the shadow foreign secretary said he “never believed” Corbyn would become leader and that his nomination was “a mistake”.  “I regret nominating Jeremy Corbyn and if I knew what I do now, I never would have nominated him,” Lammy told an online audience of about 300, in comments first reported in Jewish News. “I never believed he would become leader. That was a mistake and I am sorry for that.” Lammy went on to say he was “fully behind” Keir Starmer and said of his leadership: “I don’t believe the overall culture is toxic any more … but until the party is genuinely welcome for everyone, we remain on a journey.” His comments came after a recent survey of Jewish Labour Movement members found strong support for Starmer’s efforts to tackle antisemitism since he became leader last year. Roughly 70% of the survey’s 363 respondents said Labour was a safe space for Jewish people under Starmer’s leadership, compared with just 4% who felt the same under Corbyn. But Lammy said Labour was still “on a journey” when it came to improving relations with Britain’s Jewish groups and that certain individuals with antisemitic views remained in the party. “I’ve met some of these individuals and am frankly staggered some are still in the party,” the Tottenham MP said. “But as a lawyer, I understand that people appeal and go to court. There is a process, which can feel slow and tortuous sometimes, but it must be undertaken.” Describing himself as a subscriber to the “rainbow coalition approach to politics”, he said he was proud of the Jewish community for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with leaders including Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu in their fight against apartheid. “The Jewish community understood the fascism that was at the heart of apartheid and the pernicious evil of discrimination. The tradition that I’m from is Jewish friends recognising and being active alongside historically discriminated groups. “It means black communities like mine understanding prejudices existing against Jewish communities.”",News/Politics,Labour’s David Lammy apologises for nominating Jeremy Corbyn to be leader,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/28/david-lammy-apologises-for-nominating-corbyn-to-be-labour-leader
