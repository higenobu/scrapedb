2/16/2022,"A micrometeorite slamming into a satellite was the likely cause of a seven-hour outage for NBN Co internet users in December, a Senate hearing has been told. About 46,500 of NBN Co’s 112,000 satellite users in regional and remote parts of Australia were left without internet between 8.30pm on 21 December and 3.20am the following morning due to the incident.  NBN Co’s chief development officer for regional and remote Australia, Gavin Williams, told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday that after an investigation involving the company’s satellite operation partners, the most likely cause of the outage was determined to be a micrometeorite. “It cannot be 100% characterised as this but all the evidence points to a micrometeorite that impacted the satellite,” he said. “It effectively makes [the] satellite’s body rotate while it remains in its orbit. So the satellite is no longer pointing at the appropriate spot on Earth [and] the payload – the transmission system on that satellite – is effectively switched off for that period.” He said the satellite was able to recover itself. “Now that impacted about 46,500 customers. The satellite was able to find Earth again. You know you say ‘it’s not rocket science’, senator? This is rocket science.” The testing to restart the service took around seven hours, meaning customers were left without internet for that period. Williams said that 573 of these customers, however, went two weeks without internet after the incident. He said the NBN boxes in their homes were missing parameters in the configuration file, meaning they could not reconnect to the network, but it took NBN Co a long time to realise the issue. “So it meant that and, frankly, it took us you know, there was a course of action three times a day updates … but it took quite a long time actually to delve into what was wrong and how you could recover,” Williams said. The company had considered pulling staff away from annual leave to go out to each of the nearly 600 premises in regional and remote parts of Australia to try to fix it, but ultimately NBN Co was able to fix the issue remotely. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Williams said those customers who endured two weeks without internet services would be eligible for rebates, and the company had developed emergency patches to rapidly identify and recover services should the issue happen again. He admitted it was “not our finest hour” but said it was the first time such an event had occurred.

The NBN Co CEO, Stephen Rue, said the company would begin offering full fibre upgrades to fibre-to-the-node and fibre-to-the-curb customers in March and May respectively, but admitted the timing of the launch may be affected depending on when the election is called, and what the company’s obligations are during caretaker mode.",News/Technology,‘This is rocket science’: micrometeorite collision blamed for NBN satellite internet outage,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/16/this-is-rocket-science-micrometeorite-collision-blamed-for-nbn-satellite-internet-outage
2/16/2022,"Some of Melbourne’s most beloved live music venues say they will shut their doors for the final time within months, after operating at a loss because of density restrictions with no end in sight. On Tuesday The Curtin, which has been a cornerstone of Melbourne’s live music scene for decades, announced it would shut up shop in November, crippled by ongoing Covid restrictions and two years of lockdowns.  The Curtin news follows a concerning trend for live music fans, with Sydney venues The Lansdowne, Old 505 Theatre and Giant Dwarf all announcing they were closing within a week of each other earlier this month. Now several venues in Melbourne, including The Butterfly Club, Old Bar and The Leadbeater, are joining together to demand the state government review Covid density restrictions in Victoria and provide a date for when they will end. They say they need a lifeline or they will have to close their doors. “This city is going to be a car park,” says Paris Martine, booker at The Curtin. “This is basically what we’re doing. You can see the ‘for sale’ sign on the front of the pub.” Because of the Omicron wave, Victorian music venues were placed back under capacity restrictions on 6 January, with a limit of one person per two square metres in all indoor areas in hospitality venues. It’s not clear when this will be lifted and venues say they are running out of time. “The margins on live music are so tiny,” Martine says. “Basically, you rely upon your sold-out gigs to carry you through on the gigs that are actually smaller, which means you can’t take risks on booking lesser-known artists.” Without restrictions, Martine would be able to sell 200 tickets to a gig at The Curtin, but is only allowed to let in between 100 and 130 at the moment. Now if a show doesn’t sell out, they bleed money. “It’s not even viable,” she says. “You are opening up to turn over probably about $2,000 if you’re lucky … When you start getting down to those kinds of numbers, you’re opening knowing that you might lose money that night.” In November the Victorian government announced it would “reignite the state’s live music” scene with $8m in funding. But Martine says while she is sure “they will see that money” eventually, it hasn’t arrived yet and the situation is urgent. “We’ve all been on restrictions, devastating restrictions that are impacting our ability to survive,” she says. “And we haven’t seen a cent.” She questions why thousands of people could mosh at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, or how people could be allowed to work out inside a gym at full capacity, but they couldn’t have 200 people at The Curtin. “If we’re open enough for a major event of 10,000 to 30,000 people to go ahead, there is no justification of one person per two square metres,” Martine says. For bands busting to play after two long years of lockdowns, opportunities are still few and far between. Loretta Miller from Melbourne band Jazz Party says the scene has already dried up in Sydney and she doesn’t want to see Melbourne follow suit. “We used to play shows in Sydney, we can’t really get them much any more. There are no venues to play at. It’s a really hard city to crack,” Miller says. “I don’t want Melbourne to be that. That’s terrifying to me. Because what do we do then? There’s nowhere to play.” Jazz Party played their first show in a year last week, at an outdoor venue in regional Victoria. Their performances pay for the livelihoods of the nine members of the band, their booker and manager. “We released an album six months ago, which we’re launching in two weeks, which may or may not go ahead,” Miller says. “That’s my full-time job, that’s what I do.” Cash Savage, who leads Cash Savage and the Last Drinks, says this summer was the quietest they have had since the band started in 2008. “It’s out of control. It’s deads-ville for us,” Savage says. “We’re recording an album in summer, which would normally be bananas but there’s not really anything else to do.” Simone Pulga, director of Melbourne venue The Butterfly Club, is also struggling with the density restrictions. “Unlike every other time we’ve been under restrictions, this time, there is no key indicator as to when we are going to be coming out of them,” Pulga says. “There are some venues that have six weeks left in the bank before they need to make some very unpleasant decisions. Some might have three months. This is bad.” The federal member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, is calling on the government to intervene before the city loses any more venues. “If the Covid restrictions are staying, then live music venues and musicians need support to weather the storm,” he says. His state colleague, MP for Melbourne Ellen Sandell, who represents the seat The Curtin sits in, has accused the government of “ignoring the sector”. This week she wrote to the treasurer and creative industries minister, asking them to urgently provide extra support for smaller live music venues. “What an incredible shame it would be to lose live music from Melbourne just because the state government hasn’t listened to the industry about what they need,” Sandell wrote. On top of a review of density restrictions, Melbourne venues are asking for a plan that includes lifeline funding if restrictions come back as well as the reintroduction of the Live Music Roundtable, which facilitates dialogue between the industry and government ministers. Pulga says the state government has not consulted with small- to medium-sized venues since October last year. “There is no rule of nature that says that Melbourne must have a healthy music scene,” he says. “It took decades for it to build, for the expertise to build, for the people to gain the skills. Once it’s gone, there is nothing that says it is going to come back.”",Arts/Music,‘This city is going to be a car park’: Melbourne music venues beg for end to Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/16/this-city-is-going-to-be-a-car-park-melbourne-music-venues-beg-for-end-to-covid-restrictions
2/16/2022,"Prince Andrew’s decision to settle his sex assault case takes precedence on most of the front pages on Wednesday, with many papers reporting that the Duke was ordered by the Queen and Prince Charles to make a deal. The out-of-court settlement in the US civil case means Andrew makes no admission of guilt over claims by Virginia Giuffre that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. He had previously said he intended to fight to clear his name in court.  A letter filed with the US judge on Tuesday said the parties had reached a “settlement in principle” for an undisclosed sum. The Mirror says Andrew was under “intense pressure from the very top” to come to an agreement with his accuser to avoid the risk of any courtroom drama overshadowing the Queen’s 70th Jubilee celebrations this year. “Andrew does £12m deal to halt sex claim”, its main headline says, in a deal done “under Queen and Charles’s orders”.

2/16/2022,"Joe Biden’s speech sounded like a closing argument, one that had been honed for some time and one that suggested expectations are still high in the White House that Russia will take military action. Biden briefly nodded to Moscow’s claims to be withdrawing before abruptly contradicting them, raising the US estimate of the number of troops surrounding Ukraine to 150,000 in a “threatening position”.  It was the sort of speech normally delivered on the eve of momentous action, usually military action, to prepare expectations of the population. Biden addressed the American people directly, telling them he was not going to “pretend this will be painless” and that they would feel it at the petrol pump. He promised his administration would do what it could to alleviate that. The president also sought to speak over Putin’s head to ordinary Russians, who have heard little from their own media about the unprecedented deployments of their soldiers around Ukraine. Biden talked about their “deep ties of family history and culture” to the Ukrainians, and warned a war would bloody the country’s reputation in the history books. The world, he said, would “not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction”. He made clear that the US remained open for negotiations on mutual security concerns, saying they would pursue talks “as long as there is hope” for diplomacy, but he stuck to the US position there would no compromise on the fundamental principle of the right of Ukraine and other states to choose their alliances. Earlier in the day, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had stressed that Ukrainian membership would not happen in the foreseeable future, but Biden did not echo that conciliatory note. The US has already concluded that such verbal assurances will not be enough for Putin. The speech was part of what seems to be a very deliberate policy of this administration to think out loud about the crisis, consistently briefing its worse fears, even if it means aggravating its allies in Kyiv. The logic seems to be: we don’t know for sure what Putin will do, but we do know he likes to control the narrative, and spring the surprises. So why not create an environment of worst-case predictions, in which the only way the Russian leader can surprise the west is to opt for peace. Biden’s concluding declaration – “If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we’ll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow” – is likely to be greeted with grim mirth in Kyiv, in the wake of the US embassy’s evacuation and the retreat of American diplomats to the western end of the country. But the US has kept up arms supplies, and is reportedly making arrangements to keep the weapons flowing to an Ukrainian insurgency if it comes to that. This administration is well aware that it has been portrayed as weak for the manner in which it left Afghanistan. But Biden had long ago lost faith in the US mission there, whereas he believes wholeheartedly in Nato. He used the word “sacrosanct” to describe America’s obligation to its allies. It was deliberately resonant language. Biden is clearly aware this could turn out to be a defining test of his presidency.",News/US news,"You’re going to feel this, Biden tells Americans, as Ukraine war looms",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/youre-going-to-feel-this-biden-tells-americans-as-ukraine-war-looms
