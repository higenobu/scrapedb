1/18/2022,"One of the Conservatives’ most generous donors has called on Boris Johnson to resign and stand again for the Tory party nomination amid growing calls from its backers for a change of leadership. John Griffin, the taxi firm tycoon who has given £4m to the Tories since 2013, has become at least the fifth donor to publicly raise concerns over the Downing Street parties scandal.  It comes as anger continues to simmer against the prime minister and his administration for repeatedly breaking Covid rules to hold parties in Downing Street while the rest of the country was in lockdown. A survey of grassroots Conservative supporters found that 40% said he should resign. Griffin, the founder of Addison Lee, said Johnson should allow the party and voters to judge whether he is fit for office. “It is a shame. The whole situation has become comical. Boris has blotted his copy book and now needs to start again. “I would like to see him resign and re-present himself to the party and if he gets the nomination, to the nation. We need a fresh start otherwise this will go on for ever,” he said. Griffin’s comments follow statements from three backers this weekend who questioned Johnson’s role as leader. Peter Hargreaves, the Brexit-backing billionaire who gave £1m to the Tories for the 2019 general elections campaign, said he was “very reluctant” to continue supporting the party financially. “He doesn’t want to do good – he just wants to be prime minister. That’s his only agenda. He changed from a remainer to Brexit specifically because it would give him a chance to be prime minister ... As the Conservatives look now, I would be very reluctant to support them financially,” he said.. Hargreaves was one of three donors who voiced concerns to the Sunday Times. Lord Michael Spencer, the founder of the Nex Group, formerly ICAP, financial interdealer brokers , said: “I can’t see how Boris can last, I really can’t. He just hasn’t changed and he won’t change.” The restaurateur Richard Caring, who gave more than £200,000 to the Conservatives in 2019, told the newspaper: “He seems to have a death wish right now.” John Caudwell, the Phones4U tycoon who gave £500,000 ahead of the 2019 general election, called for Johnson to clean up his administration, or step aside. He told BBC News last week: “It’s the perceived arrogance, hypocrisy and rule breaking that is impossible to justify. “While the rest of us were striving to follow the ever-changing rules – including myself, even when I deemed them to be excessive at best, nonsensical at worst – those who were setting those rules were, apparently freely and frequently, disregarding them,” he said. The latest figures from the Electoral Commission show that the Tories received £3.7m in donations in the third quarter of 2021, double the amount received by the Labour party over the same period. Other donors told the Guardian that they will no longer make fresh donations until Johnson has gone. One, who has given more than £100,000 since Johnson became party leader in 2019, said: “He has no morals. You need morals in the middle of an international pandemic.” One former party treasurer said they did not think that the current problems faced by Johnson will result in a funding crisis for the party. “There’s always worries about where donations are coming from, but the main problem is raising money for an election, which is still probably a year to two years off. “But I don’t see this as being a run on the party’s financing. This is a midterm crisis, like all governments have, and I don’t think it’s panic time yet. Boris has this great power of recovery,” he said.",News/Politics,Tory donor urges Boris Johnson to resign amid No 10 party scandals,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/tory-donor-urges-boris-johnson-to-resign-amid-no-10-party-scandals
1/18/2022,"No 10 is drawing up plans to phase out England’s remaining pandemic restrictions from as early as March as a beleaguered Boris Johnson signals to his backbenchers that he is prepared to let the UK live with the virus. A senior source confirmed the government was looking at ending mandatory self-isolation for positive Covid cases, saying it would be “perverse” to keep the measure for the long term. It could be replaced by guidance.  The legal requirement to self-isolate, carrying fines of up to £10,000, is one of several pieces of Covid legislation due to expire in March and the government is considering whether any of it will still be necessary. Other provisions that will run out or require renewal include giving your address to NHS test and trace and listing members of your household. Powers relating to government funding for sick pay, inquests and emergency registration of medical workers also remain on the statute book. Plans to end most plan B Covid restrictions in England, including working from home guidance and Covid passports, are also set to be finalised and announced this week or early next week. But ministers are expected to continue in the short term with rules mandating mask-wearing in shops and on public transport. “There’s a few legal powers still on the statute book, not least the requirement to self-isolate. At some point we will have to address them,” the source said. Some scientists warned against downgrading laws to reduce the spread of Covid, saying it could heap pressure on the NHS, but others said it was a logical next step. It comes as Johnson faces the greatest pressure of his premiership over the Downing Street parties scandal. At the weekend it emerged that his fightback strategy, dubbed Operation Red Meat, involves drawing up or expediting measures to appease furious MPs and voters. The prime minister is said to believe he has been vindicated on the decision not to impose harsher Covid restrictions amid the surge caused by the Omicron variant, though he will risk accusations of distraction techniques to appeal to lockdown-sceptic backbenchers, scores of whom rebelled before Christmas on plan B measures. Johnson will convene a series of meetings this week to look at the trajectory of Covid data. A senior Whitehall source said there was a possibility that new testing requirements could “distort” the data, given those without symptoms are no longer required to take a PCR test after a positive rapid test, and many do not self-report their results to the NHS. But the source said that the pattern would still be evident. “Even if it does change some of the numbers, we are able to monitor the path of cases accurately.” Two senior sources said Covid certification and home working rules were “unlikely to continue” past 26 January but mask-wearing could remain. No 10 is also likely to lift the requirement for travellers to take a Covid test on their return from abroad, a key demand of the transport secretary Grant Shapps. In its autumn/winter plan, the government said it would review the future of regulations relating to self-isolation by the end of March 2022 but that was published before Omicron hit. Asked about plans to drop the legal requirement to isolate after a positive Covid test, Prof Azra Ghani, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said self-isolation remained an important aspect of the public health response. “The widespread availability of lateral flow tests that enable self-isolation has undoubtedly been one of our strongest responses to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Ghani said. “We should therefore see this as an opportunity to enhance our public health response to other serious diseases rather than to downgrade our Covid response. “Such an approach would, in addition to saving lives, reduce the annual winter burden of respiratory illnesses on the NHS, freeing up space and resources to focus on other health needs.” But Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh and a contributor to the modelling group Spi-M, said the step was inevitable and not without logic. “So long as it’s with guidance from the state of the epidemic in the UK, it doesn’t seem unreasonable,” he said, adding that by March boosters should have been given to the majority who are eligible and want them. “Flu season should be largely over, and hopefully by then we’ll also get a sense of how much antivirals are helping to reduce severity. In general, we also might expect less mixing indoors and circulating natural immunity should be very high at that point.” The timing of the announcement on plan B is likely to be affected by the release of a report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray into alleged lockdown breaches in Downing Street, including by Johnson himself. On Monday, Downing Street said it would give businesses enough time before next Wednesday to prepare for the lifting of restrictions or any other changes. Johnson’s spokesman said: “In terms of the data, there are some encouraging signs that infections are falling across the country. Obviously we want to see that mirrored in the latest ONS data as well. “There are also some signs of falls – or at least plateauing – in admissions and occupancy in hospital, which is good to see, but it still remains the case that our NHS is under significant pressure – there are over 16,000 Covid patients in hospital in England alone.”",News/World news,All Covid restrictions in England could end in March under No 10 plans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/all-covid-restrictions-in-england-could-end-in-march-under-no-10-plans
1/18/2022,"Good morning. Still searching for rapid antigen tests? Orders from big business and governments means less are ending up on the shelves. The extent of the damage in Tonga is becoming clearer. And some tips on how to keep your mask effective. The shortage of rapid antigen tests for consumers is being exacerbated by state and federal governments and large corporates placing mammoth orders for the self-administered test kits, causing stock to be diverted from online retailers and pharmacies. Australia is currently in the midst of a huge Omicron wave after state and federal governments pivoted from a policy of Covid suppression to one of “living with the virus”, causing a surge in demand for rapid antigen testing kits. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, denied on Monday the commonwealth was requisitioning supplies of rapid antigen tests, as it can do under the Health Act allows.  Hit by staff shortages and tens of thousands of new Covid cases daily, GPs in Australia remain under-resourced despite “enormous pressure”. A general practitioner in Victoria responsible for triaging Covid-positive patients and referring them to appropriate health services has said Australia “must now have one of the worst Covid responses in the world”, as clinics are overwhelmed. The doctor, who cannot be named due to fear of repercussions from his employer, said: “Australia has utterly squandered any gains we made during the pandemic … We are now seeing the sort of mess and chaos here that we saw in the UK at the start of Covid.” A body believed to be that of a British woman missing following the tsunami in Tonga, has been found, according to her family. Angela Glover, 50, died after an undersea volcano erupted near the Pacific nation on Saturday, sending large waves crashing across the shore. Her brother, Nick Eleini, said Glover, who ran an animal shelter, had died trying to save her dogs. Australia’s minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, says initial reports suggest no mass casualties in Tonga following the disaster, but Australian police have visited beaches with significant damage and “houses thrown around”. Australia and New Zealand sent surveillance flights on Monday to assess the damage after Tonga was isolated from the rest of the world when Saturday’s eruption blanketed the Pacific Island with ash. The health of Australian writer and democracy activist Dr Yang Hengjun is failing as he approaches three years imprisoned in China, say friends who fear he may not survive his incarceration. Wednesday marks three years since Yang’s arrest at Guangzhou airport on allegations of espionage on behalf of an unnamed foreign country. He maintains his innocence. A man who was forced to hand over his phone and passcode to Australian Border Force after returning to Melbourne from holiday has labelled the tactic “an absolute gross violation of privacy”, as tech advocates call for transparency and stronger privacy protections for people’s devices as they enter the country. Sky News sought to justify misleading Covid commentary that then-host Alan Jones was putting to air, saying it was balanced by coverage of the daily Covid press conferences, in a letter sent to the broadcasting regulator obtained by Guardian Australia. The federal government has been accused of making a “disgraceful” attempt to cast secrecy over a case relating to Australia’s negotiations with Timor-Leste in the years prior to the controversial bugging operation revealed by Witness K and Bernard Collaery. Novak Djokovic may not be allowed to defend his French Open title in May after the French government ruled that all athletes will have to be vaccinated in order to attend and compete in sporting events in France. Russia has begun moving troops to Ukraine’s northern neighbour Belarus for joint military exercises, in a move likely to increase fears in the west that Moscow is preparing for an invasion. The hostage-taking attack on a Texas synagogue has renewed fears of increasing antisemitism in the United States. The incident, which Joe Biden called “an act of terror”, comes as organisations tracking antisemitic violence say it is increasing across the US. China’s coal production reached record levels last year as the state encouraged miners to ramp up their fossil fuel output to safeguard the country’s energy supplies through the winter gas crisis. A French court has found the far-right presidential candidate Éric Zemmour guilty of racist hate speech for a tirade against unaccompanied child migrants. Zemmour drew widespread outrage in September 2020 when he told the CNews channel that child migrants were “thieves, killers, they’re rapists. That’s all they are. We should send them back.” More than 830,000, or around one in nine, Australian women suffer from endometriosis, a condition that can cause debilitating pain during the menstrual cycle as well as during ovulation, sex, urination and bowel movements. Other symptoms include inflammation, bloating, heavy bleeding and fatigue, and it can impact fertility. Regular exercise though may help reduce the pain, inflammation and risk of getting endometriosis, say experts. But here are some things to consider. In the latest in our My unforgettable gig series, Melbourne indie rocker Alex Lahey recalls the fortuitous last-minute stage switch at the 2017 Groovin the Moo festival that saw thousands of Amy Shark fans accidentally turn up to her gig. “My knees went really weak – they turned to jelly,” she says. “It was so out of any reality I had considered – staring down the barrel of 7,000 people in front of me with flames on this screen behind me. It was like a runaway train.” We were told coronavirus didn’t discriminate, but it didn’t need to – society had already done that for us. But there is a path to a fairer future if we want it. China’s Wang Qiang secured her first win over a top-20 player since beating Serena Williams at Melbourne Park in 2020 after upsetting 18th-seeded Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 at the Australian Open on Monday. Meanwhile, at the second round of the Australian Open, Rafael Nadal made a convincing return to grand slam tennis as the only man bidding for a 21st grand slam title this fortnight following Novak Djokovic’s deportation. AFLW should be recognised as a winter sport staged alongside the men, argues Rana Hussain. The women’s competition is reaping no benefits from being the summer sideshow to the AFL’s main event.

The Barcelona midfielder beat off the challenge of Chelsea’s Sam Kerr and teammate Jennifer Hermoso to win the prize. Meanwhile Lewandowski’s competition came from Mohamed Salah and Messi but the Pole was victorious, retaining the same award he won a year ago. It was a fine night for Chelsea as they collected three awards; Emma Hayes and Thomas Tuchel won in the best coach categories, while Edouard Mendy picked up the prize for goalkeeper of the year. The Senegal international had been nominated for the award alongside Italy’s Gianluigi Donnarumma and Germany’s Manuel Neuer. Chile’s Christiane Endler won the women’s award. Tuchel, who took over at Stamford Bridge in January 2021, won the best men’s coach after helping Chelsea to the Champions League. The German said: “It was a pretty normal day so far at the training centre, I’ve just come from training because we have a game (on Tuesday), but now you opened the envelope and said my name, it’s pretty surreal.

1/18/2022,"Eddie Jones is free to select unvaccinated players in a bumper 36-man Six Nations squad on Tuesday despite strict travel rules that look set to rule them out of two of England’s three away fixtures, including a potential decider against France on Super Saturday.  Jones was restricted to just 28 players last year, when England finished a dismal fifth place in the table, but a new deal has been struck with the Premiership clubs which allows for greater flexibility. It also means that Jones can name players who will be available for England’s opening match away to Scotland on 5 February but not for the trip to Italy the following week if they are not fully vaccinated. Italian rules – among the strictest in Europe – state that travellers must comply with domestic regulations and have a “super green pass” to enter sports stadiums, acquired with proof of vaccination. The French government has implemented a similar ruling and Six Nations organisers have insisted that all national laws will be respected. England met the 85% vaccination target for the autumn internationals but the centre Henry Slade is among the highest-profile to have previously expressed hesitancy and Jones could find himself forced to make changes for the trips to Rome as well as Paris, on the final weekend of the tournament. It is believed however, that rather than introduce a blanket selection policy, unvaccinated players can still be considered for England’s other three matches. The new deal with the clubs undoubtedly helps in that regard because, as well as enabling Jones to pick more players, there is far greater flexibility in moving them in and out of the squad. Jones is further boosted by the fact that he has a relatively injury-free pool of players to select from (Anthony Watson’s long-term knee problem notwithstanding) and on Sunday Owen Farrell is expected to make a timely comeback for Saracens from the knee injury suffered against Australia. Given England’s three autumn victories, Jones is unlikely to make wholesale personnel changes and it would be a surprise if either Mako or Billy Vunipola returned. The same can be said for George Ford despite his form for Leicester, all the more so given Jones is said to be considering selecting a rookie fly-half for the get-together on the south coast. Orlando Bailey, Fin Smith and Charlie Atkinson would all fit the bill. Elsewhere, it is understood Jones has been impressed by the form of Nick Isiekwe, who won the last of his three caps in South Africa in the summer of 2018. His Saracens teammate Elliot Daly comes back into contention, having missed the autumn through injury, as does Jack Nowell, and Jones is also understood to have taken a keen interest in Worcester’s South African-born flanker Kyle Hatherell. The 21-year-old Alfie Barbeary is leading the charge of uncapped youngsters after another fine showing for Wasps in their victory over Toulouse at the weekend. He has been included in Jones’s wider squad before and his form would merit further selection. It is unclear whether Manu Tuilagi will be part of Tuesday’s squad, however. The 30-year-old centre sustained a hamstring injury in the autumn win over South Africa and has not played since. He has been pencilled in by Sale Sharks for a comeback against his former club Leicester on 30 January but players selected for the camp in Brighton are not due to be available for domestic duty that weekend. Tuilagi, though, has expressed a desire to get a match for Sale under his belt.",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones can select unvaccinated players for England despite travel rules,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/eddie-jones-can-select-unvaccinated-players-for-england-despite-travel-rules
1/18/2022,"Britain is supplying Ukraine with new light anti-tank weapons “in light of the increasingly threatening behaviour from Russia”, the defence secretary has announced. As Russia stepped up its troop deployment by moving forces into Belarus, Ben Wallace told MPs on Monday evening that the UK was in the process of providing extra arms to Kyiv – a move he told parliament was intended to be defensive.  “We have taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapons systems,” Wallace said, and added that “a small number” of British troops would provide training to help Kyiv’s forces in using them. “Let me be clear: this support is for short-range and clearly defensive weapon capabilities; they are not strategic weapons and pose no threat to Russia; they are to use in self-defence,” Wallace said. Defence sources would not immediately spell out what weapons had been supplied and how many – although the Kremlin has in the past voiced irritation with Nato members that have supplied Ukraine with arms, most notably Turkey, which sold six TB2 drones to Kyiv last autumn. Experts said the arms supplied were likely to be handheld next-generation light anti-tank weapons, with a range of a few hundred metres, intended to help combat Russia’s tank-heavy army. They have similar capabilities, but are not as powerful as the Javelin anti-tank missiles supplied by the US to Ukraine from 2018, and can in theory knock out a tank by striking it from above. Wallace also said he would invite his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, for bilateral talks in London. “We are ready to discuss issues related to mutual security concerns and engage constructively, in good faith,” he added. Labour said it supported the announcement, on which it had been briefed in advance. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, described them as “anti-tank weapons” and said the UK must ensure they “won’t be used, unless Russia invades”. The latest move represents a step up from existing British military commitments. Until recently the UK has focused on selling ships and naval equipment to Ukraine, announcing a £1.7bn deal to supply two mine sweepers and jointly build eight new ships for its small Black Sea fleet. Russia has massed over 100,000 troops on its borders with Ukraine, demanding that the country never become a member of Nato and insisting on other security guarantees that would amount to the creation of a sphere of influence for Moscow in former Soviet states. Some troops have begun to move into Belarus, north of Ukraine, for planned military exercises – also thought by military analysts to be the most direct route to attack Kyiv. Moscow’s demands were rejected by the west in a series of diplomatic negotiations last week, prompting concerns that Russia may be ready to consider a military options to reassert greater control over Ukraine. Nato members have said the alliance would not intervene militarily to defend Kyiv, but has indicated that it would be prepared to hit Russia with sanctions – and continue to supply arms to forces inside the country. “I have visited Ukraine five times since 2016, and I know that the Ukrainians are a proud people who will stand and fight – for their country, for democracy and for freedom,” Wallace said. “Any invasion will not be viewed as a ‘liberation’ but as occupation, and I fear that it could lead to huge loss of life on all sides. “The current difficult relationship with the Kremlin is not the one we wish it to have with the United Kingdom, it does not have to be this way.” Wallace said when it came to the UK-Russia relationship “the current gap is wide but it is not unbridgeable”. “We wish to be friends with the Russian people as we have been for hundreds of years. And there is a world in which we can establish a mutually beneficial relationship with Russia. “I still remain hopeful that diplomacy will prevail. It is President Putin’s choice whether to choose diplomacy and dialogue, or conflict and the consequences.” Tobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the defence committee, asked what additional support Nato would provide if Putin gave the green light to an invasion. Wallace replied: “There is still a way to go, we still have Nato, we still have our alliances, we still have the international community and its effort to try and find a diplomatic solution, and we will carry on doing that until the very last moment. “I hope – because I think President Putin has still not made a final decision – but I hope that that is enough to ward the Kremlin off, a united front on sanctions, which is what we are developing, prepared and ready if something were to happen, a strong resilience in Ukraine should at the very least give people a pause for thought. The first systems were delivered today in country.”",News/Politics,"UK supplying Ukraine with anti-tank weapons, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/uk-supplying-ukraine-with-anti-tank-weapons-mps-told
1/18/2022,"The Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr has told a court she believes the multimillionaire Brexit backer Arron Banks may have been “used and exploited” by the Russian government, as she defended her reporting. Banks, who funded the Leave.EU campaign group, is suing Cadwalladr for defamation over two instances in which she said the businessman was lying about his relationship with the Russian state.  A judge previously ruled that the meaning of the remarks, made by the journalist at the Ted technology conference and in a related tweet, was that Banks lied about a secret relationship with the Russian government “in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding”. Cadawalladr has said that she did not intend to imply that Banks had lied about receiving money from Russia, only about the extent of his contacts with Russia. She is relying on the defence that her reporting was in the public interest. Giving evidence about her reporting at the high court in central London on Monday, Cadwalladr said: “Reflecting upon the evidence I thought it was possible he was used and exploited by the Russian government.” In her written evidence statement, she said she had obtained two intelligence files from an organisation contracted to undertake work countering Russian disinformation in Europe on behalf of a government agency, one file of which raised concerns about Banks’s Russian wife. Cadwalladr said the file claimed Katya Banks had entered Britain on a passport sequentially numbered to the passport of Katia Zatuliveter, a woman MI5 had claimed was a Russian spy and who had had an affair with the Portsmouth MP, Mike Hancock. Katya Banks was also alleged to have had a relationship with Hancock. The significance of the sequential numbers, according to Cadwalladr, was that the open-source intelligence organisation Bellingcat, while examining the 2018 novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, had identified two suspects in CCTV photos as Russian intelligence officers partly through evidence that the men’s passport numbers were only separated by three digits and had therefore been issued at nearly the same time. Cadwalladr said in her witness statement: “I found the suggestion that Katya Banks was linked in some way to Russian intelligence potentially credible. I also knew that the Kremlin had a track record in channelling money and influence operations via the wives of oligarchs. A specialist Russian investigator told me that they ‘always look at the wives’.” She said the other intelligence file detailed allegations of Arron Banks’s involvement in organised crime in South Africa, including money laundering and cigarette and diamond smuggling. Cadwalladr added that she was contacted by Banks’s former business partner in South Africa, Chris Kimber, who had owned diamond mines with the claimant and who said Banks had negotiations with Russian business people about investing in the mines, including from Russian state-owned firms. William McCormick QC, representing Banks, said Cadawalladr should have explicitly stated in all her reporting that there was no evidence of Banks being in receipt of Russian money but had failed to do so. Earlier, Banks, giving evidence, described Cadwalladr’s reporting as “hysterical”, claiming she was motivated by personal animus against him and dealing with conspiracy theories against him. The trial continues.",News/UK news,"Arron Banks may have been ‘used and exploited’ by Russia, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/17/arron-banks-used-and-exploited-by-russia-court-hears
