The head of Russia's spy service stammered over his words as President Vladimir Putin pressed him on whether he supported the decision to recognize two Kremlin-backed separatist regions in Ukraine as independent states. A video of the exchange showed the back and forth between Putin and Sergei Naryshkin, chief of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, at a security council meeting on Monday, during which Putin grilled each of the members. Naryshkin appears to stumble over his words as Putin cuts him off multiple times. —Shaun Walker (@shaunwalker7) February 21, 2022 Putin was pressing Naryshkin on whether he supported recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states, rather than part of Ukraine, according to The Guardian. The outlet said Putin twice snapped at Naryshkin to ""speak directly!"" Naryshkin responded that he supported the regions ""becoming a part of Russia,"" prompting Putin to tell him that was not currently being discussed and that recognizing them as independent states was the only thing presently being considered. Hours after the meeting, Putin delivered a long, passionate speech in which he announced Russia was recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states and ordered troops into the regions. The move drew swift condemnation from the West, with the White House imposing sanctions on the regions shortly after.

2/22/2022,"LISBON (Reuters) - A fire which swept through a cargo ship carrying thousands of luxury cars and adrift off the coast of Portugal's Azores islands has lost its intensity, probably because there is little left to burn, a port official said. The Felicity Ace, carrying around 4,000 vehicles including Porsches, Audis and Bentleys, some electric with lithium-ion batteries, caught fire in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday. The 22 crew members on board were evacuated the same day. ""The fire has subsided in recent hours,"" João Mendes Cabeças, captain of the nearest port in the Azorean island of Faial, told Lusa news agency, saying there was probably little combustible material left to burn. Cabeças told Reuters over the weekend lithium-ion batteries in the electric vehicles were ""keeping the fire alive"", adding that specialist equipment was required to extinguish it. It was not clear whether the batteries sparked the fire. He also said the fire was spreading closer to the ship's fuel tanks. ""Our concern has been with pollution since the ship has large amounts of fuel on board and car batteries but so far there are no hotbeds of pollution,"" Cabeças told Lusa. As the fire's intensity ebbs, firefighting teams and technicians might be able to board the vessel to prepare towing it to either Europe or the Bahamas, Cabeças said. Volkswagen, which owns the brands, did not confirm the total number of cars on board and said on Friday it was awaiting further information. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the next steps to identify the cause of the fire.

2/22/2022,"ROME (AP) — Mount Etna has roared back to spectacular action after a few months of relative quiet, sending up a 12-kilometer (7.5-mile) high volcanic ash cloud over eastern Sicily. The lava flow from Etna, one of Europe’s most active volcanoes, was centered around the crater on the mountain’s southeast slope, Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology said Monday. There were no immediate reports of injuries or property damage on the inhabited towns ringing the slopes of the volcano, which is popular with hikers, skiers and other tourists. By Monday afternoon, the lava flow from the crater had stopped, the institute said. But earlier in the day, while the volcanic cloud was pouring out of Etna, the institute issued a warning for aircraft in the area. The towering cloud, visible for kilometers, was the latest impressive show of Etna's power this month. Earlier in February, a particularly powerful eruption sent bolts of lightning dramatically across the sky over eastern Sicily. Etna has had scores of known eruptions in its history. In 1669, in what has been considered the volcano’s worst-known eruption, lava buried a swath of Catania, the largest city in the east on the island of Sicily, and devastated dozens of villages. More recently, in 1983, dynamite was used to divert lava threatening towns. In 1992, the army built an earthen wall to contain the lava, flowing from Etna for months, so it wouldn't barrel into one of the villages on the slopes.",World/Associated Press,"Mount Etna roars again, sends up towering volcanic ash cloud",https://news.yahoo.com/mount-etna-roars-again-sends-154720297.html
