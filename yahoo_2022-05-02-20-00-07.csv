5/2/2022,"Two new strains of COVID that appear to be more transmissible than even “stealth Omicron,” and that have the ability to evade antibodies from vaccination and prior infection, have arrived in the U.S.—and they could mean a new wave is coming. BA.4 and BA.5—like the original Omicron, BA.1—originated in South Africa. Cases are surging there despite the fact that almost all South Africans have been vaccinated or had COVID, Bloomberg reported last week. The country's National Institute for Communicable Diseases reported nearly 4,000 new infections on Sunday alone. Of those who were tested for COVID, 22% received positive results. The World Health Organization initially recommended levels of below 5% for communities wishing to reopen after COVID's first wave. People who have been both vaccinated against COVID and infected with Omicron may very well get sick if they contract the subvariants. But they probably won’t require hospitalization or die, a top COVID researcher from South Africa told Fortune. “If you were vaccinated and had Omicron, your protection is decent, at least against severe disease,” said Alex Sigal, a professor at the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa. He’s one of the authors on a new study that found BA.4 and BA.5 could result in a new wave of infection due to their ability to evade antibodies, both from vaccination and earlier infection. “If anybody is protected, it should be these people,” he added. That’s good news for many, but America’s vaccination rates are not where they could be. Around 66.2% of the total population is fully vaccinated, and only 45.8% have received a booster, according to the CDC. Children under 5 are still not eligible for the vaccine. Others won’t be so fortunate. Sigal says those who’ve been infected with COVID prior to Omicron likely don’t have much immunity to BA.4 and BA.5. Those who were infected with Omicron but not vaccinated won’t have much immunity either—”it could go either way” for them, he said. BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be more infectious than BA.2, also known as “stealth Omicron,” which was more infectious than the original Omicron, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing South African COVID expert Tulio de Oliveira, the head of the institutes at the universities of KwaZulu-Natal and Stellenbosch. On Friday, Fortune was the first to report that both variants had arrived in the U.S., citing multiple COVID-19 researchers with access to GISAID, an international research database that tracks changes in COVID and the flu virus. The earliest sample of BA.4 in the U.S. was collected on March 30. The earliest sample of BA.5 in the U.S. was collected March 29. A new BA.4/BA.5 wave is “a strong possibility,” given the subvariants' increased transmissibility and their ability to evade immunity, Sigal and his team wrote in their new study But Sigal doesn’t expect a huge wave, given that Omicron infected so many worldwide. He also doesn’t expect “a very severe wave in terms of disease severity,” he said, given the measure of protection—albeit reduced—that vaccination and/or prior Omicron infection will offer. “Infections? Yes,” he said. “Disease severity? Not so much.” Sigal and his team tested the new subvariants against blood samples from individuals who had been vaccinated with shots from Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson, and who had experienced a breakthrough BA.1 infection, as well as those who had been previously infected with BA.1 but had not been vaccinated. They found that those who had been previously infected but not vaccinated experienced a nearly eightfold drop in neutralizing antibodies when exposed to the new subvariants. Those who had been vaccinated and previously infected saw a more mild threefold decrease, according to the study. Sigal said he was surprised by the study’s results. He didn’t expect BA.4 and BA.5 to escape immunity so well, especially considering that the variants have only two changes when compared to the original Omicron. “But apparently those are big changes,” he said. So far symptoms of the new variants seem pretty similar to the typical Omicron symptoms, which include fever, loss of smell, and malaise. “I haven’t seen early symptoms of respiratory distress, the major COVID-specific symptom that makes this disease so dangerous,” he said. “It doesn’t feel nice, but there’s less chance of dying.” There’s “good evidence” that COVID is becoming milder with time, he said, due to the fact that it’s not infecting the lower respiratory tract, where permanent damage can happen and dangerous low blood oxygen saturations can be triggered. Newer COVID variants reside in the upper respiratory tract, where it’s unlikely to cause serious illness. Until recently, experts thought that a new, very different variant would be required to cause a wave, as was the case with Delta. But now subvariants “seem to be able to make a new wave,” Sigal said. But subvariants—including BA.4 and BA.5—worry him less than new variants. “They’re not so different from what was there before. They’re not going to do a huge amount of damage even though they might do a lot of infection,” he said. “When I see something completely different, that’s when it’s time to really get concerned.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Health/Fortune,Two new Omicron variants detected in the U.S. could spark another COVID wave.

5/2/2022,"Hope Solo, a former goalkeeper for the US women's national soccer team, is entering an alcohol rehab program, she announced Friday, weeks after she was found passed out behind the wheel of her car with her children in the backseat. In a statement posted to her Twitter, Solo, 40, said she had asked the National Soccer Hall of Fame to postpone her induction to next year and that she was voluntarily entering an in-patient alcohol treatment program to address what she described as ""challenges with alcohol."" ""At this time, my energies and focus are totally directed to my health, healing and taking care of my family,"" the retired soccer star said. ""I want to thank the Hall of Fame for their support and for understanding my decision."" Solo, who is known as one of the — if not the — best goalkeeper in US soccer history, was arrested on March 31 on suspicion of driving while impaired, resisting a public officer, and misdemeanor child abuse. She had allegedly been passed out for more than an hour in a Walmart parking lot, with the engine of her car running and while her 2-year-old twins were in the backseat, when she was noticed by a passerby. The Associated Press reported that a responding officer with the Winston-Salem Police Department could smell alcohol on her breath, but when he attempted to administer a field sobriety test, Solo refused. A blood sample was taken instead. Solo's arrest was the latest in a series of run-ins with law enforcement over the last 10 years. In 2014, she was arrested after she was accused of assaulting her sister and her nephew in an incident at her home in Seattle. She pleaded ""not guilty"" to domestic violence charges that were later dismissed. In another incident, the soccer star was handed a 30-day suspension after her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. Solo was in the car with Stevens when he was apprehended while driving a US Soccer team van. For years, Solo was the USWNT's starting keeper, winning a World Cup and two Olympic gold medals in more than 200 appearances with the storied team. In 2016, she became the first goalie in the world to earn 100 career shutouts in international play. But her time with the national team came to an end later that year after she called the Swedish team ""cowards"" for their defensive tactics that led them to triumph over the No. 1 ranked US team in a penalty shootout at the quarterfinals of the 2016 Rio Olympics. US Soccer suspended and then fired Solo following her comments. She ultimately retired from the sport that year. In a statement, the Hall of Fame, which was due to induct Solo at a ceremony next month, said it ""fully"" supported Solo's decision and looked forward ""to honoring her and her historic achievements at next year’s induction ceremony.""
