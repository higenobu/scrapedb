The onshore yuan fell to its weakest in a year on concerns about rising capital outflows and oil sank below $100 on worries over Chinese demand. A Covid flareup that shut down much of Shanghai appeared to worsen over the weekend after China ordered mandatory tests in a district of Beijing and locked down some areas of the capital.

In the stock market, a closely-watched support line for the Shanghai Composite Index is under threat. The benchmark is hovering near 3,000 points, a level it has held above for over a decade. Commodity Impact China’s strict adherence to Covid Zero is also sweeping through commodities markets, with the nation heading for the largest oil demand shock since the early days of the pandemic.
