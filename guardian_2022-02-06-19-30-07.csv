2/6/2022,"During a visit to 1 Police Plaza, the headquarters of the NYPD in downtown Manhattan, Joe Biden asked officer Sumit Sulan to stand as he praised his bravery. Last month, the rookie officer shot and killed a man who mortally wounded two of his colleagues while responding to a domestic dispute in Harlem.  The deaths of the two young officers, Jason Rivera, 22, and Wilbert Mora, 27, was one of several violent episodes that have shaken New York and tested its new mayor, former police captain Eric Adams. “I admire the hell out of all of you,” Biden, flanked by Adams and other elected officials, said to the rows of uniformed blue seated behind him. “The answer is not to defund the police,” he continued to applause. “It’s to give you the tools, the training, the funding to be partners, to be protectors.” Later, the presidential motorcade crossed the East River to Queens, where Biden met with a violence intervention group and community leaders at Public School 111, in a classroom decorated for Black History Month. “We can’t just talk about violence and not talk about students feeling safe in schools,” K Bain, the founder and executive director of Community Capacity Development, a community violence intervention program, told the president. “I agree,” Biden interjected quietly, as Bain advocated for a community-based approach to reducing violence. The meetings at 1 Police Plaza and PS 111 underscored the complex public safety – and political – challenge confronting Democratic leaders from New York’s city hall to the White House and many other places across the US. Amid rising crime, Democrats are under pressure to prove that they are aggressively confronting the issue, an increasingly salient concern among voters, without abandoning their promises of police reform and accountability in response to the repeated police killings of Black Americans and a history of racism in law enforcement. In New York, Biden sent dual messages. He forcefully asserted his support for law enforcement, loudly distancing himself from activist calls to “defund the police,” which emerged during the summer of racial justice protests after the killing of George Floyd and that Republicans are mercilessly using to try to brand the president and his party as unconcerned with public safety. But Biden also sought to convey that he was listening to – and even learning from – the communities of color most impacted by the pandemic-era violence. “We all want safety, right?” said Quentin James, the president of Collective PAC, an organization dedicated to electing African American candidates. “Safety from criminals but also safety from police overreach. It’s not either/or. It has to be both/and.” Gun violence and homicides rose sharply in 2020 and 2021, with Black and Latino communities hit the hardest. Though the toll remains far lower than it was in the early 1990s, the jump from 2019 to 2020 represented the largest single-year spike in homicides in modern history, according to the CDC. “This is not a make-believe kind of thing,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a prominent New York-based Democratic consultant who was a police officer before working in politics. Public polling shows voters are now deeply concerned about rising crime and unhappy with Biden’s handling of the issue. A Fox Business poll from December found that 77% of voters, including 67% of Democrats, were concerned about higher crime rates across the country. The only issue more concerning to voters, according to the poll, was inflation. Yet, in a sign of the complexity of the issue, the same poll found that despite voters’ growing concern over the issue, less than half said they feared criminal activity “in their neighborhood”. “It’s the sense that things are out of control,” Sheinkopf said. “And Democrats tend to lose elections when things appear to be out of control.” Republicans believe the issue will be a powerful motivator for their base in November, especially against a Democratic party divided over its response to the problem. And there are signs the Republican effort to paint American cities as lawless under Democratic control, amplified by a conservative media echo chamber, are resonating. According to Gallup’s annual “mood of the nation” survey, just 24% of Americans were satisfied with efforts to “reduce or control crime”, the lowest it’s been. Frank Luntz, a prominent Republican pollster, said the issue was a top priority for voters in his focus groups, many of whom have grown disillusioned with political leadership on the issue. “It’s not just the spike in criminality that impacts people,” he said in an email. “It’s the perception that anyone, anywhere could themselves become a victim. It’s also the belief among many that the police are being handcuffed by the politicians into doing nothing.” The White House has pushed back on right wing accusations that it’s been unresponsive to the issue, pointing to Biden’s crime-fighting agenda he released in last summer. “I think we all agree or should agree that violent crime is a serious problem,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, noting the uptick began in 2020, under the previous administration. “We’re about the facts here, and addressing crime is something that is a root of the President’s agenda.” From Richard Nixon’s “law and order” to Donald Trump’s “American carnage,” Republicans have a long history of using the threat of crime to stoke fear among white voters, said Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine who has written extensively about the partisan divisions over race and identity. “The Republican Party and their base are increasingly animated by white grievance issues,” he said. “You can see this in their playbook on critical race theory, the strong push against Biden’s immigration policies and also on crime.” The politics of violent crime are complex, said James. But he said the debate is too often ignores the voices and the needs of the people in the communities that are the most impacted. “Crime is always of concern with Black voters,” he said. “But we’re hearing about it now because it’s happening in places that people thought were safer.” Experts who study violence point to several possible drivers, among them the economic hardship and social instability caused by the pandemic, which fell hardest on impoverished communities and led to fewer criminal trials, school closures and after-school programs, and reduced access to mental health services and drug treatment. Another possible contributing factor is the surge of firearm purchases and the rise of “ghost guns” – firearms assembled from parts bought online that lack serial numbers needed to trace them. DeVone Boggan, the founder of Advance Peace, a community violence intervention program, said the pandemic “exposed just how disconnected those communities” are from the services they need to address systemic health and economic disparities. But it’s also proved how successful meaningful investment in violence prevention programs can be. In Richmond, where Advance Peace was first developed, gun homicide rates dropped by nearly 70% over the past decade. In 2020, Richmond saw only a modest increase in homicides with 22 people killed that year compared to 17 the year before. “That tells us that when we make long-term commitments to non-law enforcement-based strategies, and we make requisite funding commitments long-term … that work can support reductions in gunfire even when you see things like a pandemic,” said Boggan, who made this point directly to Biden during a meeting at the White House on gun crime prevention in June. During his visit to New York, Biden emphasized his administration’s efforts to reduce violent crime by cracking down on illegal gun sales and encouraging state and local governments to use the pandemic relief aid to “put more cops on the beat.” Biden has also called on Congress to approve his budget proposal, which includes $300m in federal grants for police departments and $200m for community violence prevention programs, and to pass gun safety legislation, like universal background checks. Yet the approach also highlights the limits of what Biden can do without action in Congress and buy-in from local governments. A bipartisan attempt to overhaul policing tactics and accountability collapsed last year. A proposal to invest $5bn in community violence intervention initiatives is tied up in the stalled negotiations over the president’s Build Back Better agenda – derailed by Republican intransigence and conservative Democrats. The focus on crime also brings Biden to the forefront of an issue that has proved difficult for him over the course of his long tenure in elected office. As a senator, Biden helped write several major pieces of anti-crime legislation, including a 1994 omnibus bill that academics and many elected officials in both parties now say paved the way for an era of mass incarceration of Black Americans. During the 2020 presidential primary, Biden was pushed to disavow some elements of the bill he helped write. And as president, he has taken steps to further undo the legacy of the law, such as endorsing a bill that would end the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Now he finds himself caught between an aggressive Republican campaign to paint him as soft on crime and a progressive flank demanding he live up to his promises of criminal justice reform. Many Democrats see Adams as a model. Adams, the city’s second Black mayor and a moderate who joined the NYPD after being beaten by officers when he was 15, placed public safety as the center of his campaign, portraying himself as a bridge between liberal activists and law enforcement. Sheinkopf said the mayor’s credibility with law enforcement and his support among voters of color helps deflect Republican accusations that the party is anti-police as well as progressive criticism of a tougher approach. “All he’s got to do is cling to Adams and say, ‘I’m going to follow what Eric Adams does because he’s an expert,” Sheinkopf said. The interplay was on display in New York, where Adams, referring to himself as the “Biden of Brooklyn”, praised the president as he called for a “9/11-type response” to the “domestic terror that is pervasive in this city and country”. “Mayor Adams, you and I agree,” Biden said at the NYPD headquarters. The alliance worries progressives who hear echoes of the punitive “law and order” approach Democrats embraced in the 1990s. Aspects of Adam’s “blueprint” to reduce gun violence – welcomed by Democrats who believe the problem has become a political liability for the party – sparked backlash from progressives, such as a proposal to resurrect a version of the plainclothes anti-crime units that were disbanded in 2020. Police reform advocate Robert Gangi called the plan “old wine in a new bottle” that relied “mainly on punitive law enforcement tactics”. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, told the New York Times that she was concerned Democrats were reverting to a “jails-and-police-centered policy” that doesn’t address the root causes of crime. Boggan, too, worries about this. “If we go down this road, this road that we’ve already been down,” he warned, “we will dramatically and in devastating fashion cost the communities most impacted by gun violence the opportunity for real public safety.”",News/US news,"Stalled agendas, tumbling ratings: Biden takes a hit as Republicans’ lawlessness cries resonate",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/06/midterms-joe-biden-violent-crime
2/6/2022,"China should not have been given the honour of hosting this year’s Winter Olympics. When Beijing hosted the summer Games in 2008, the prevailing hope was that engagement with China would lead to greater openness. Such views now look naive. Instead, the opposite has happened: while China’s economy has boomed, the last decade has seen a concerted crackdown on human rights, a centralisation of political power and creeping and extensive surveillance, as athletes and officials are now discovering. This growing authoritarianism has reached new and sinister heights under President Xi Jinping, including the dismantling of Hong Kong’s democracy. Most horrific is the situation in Xinjiang, where there is extensive evidence of mass “re-education” camps, forced labour, forced sterilisation and cultural repression on an industrial scale against the Uyghur people. The appalling treatment of the Uyghurs has led our parliament and others around the world to recognise that China’s actions amount to genocide.  This is why Labour has pressured the government into a political boycott: with no officials, politicians or representatives attending the Games. We did not say athletes should stay at home, because they train for their whole careers for the chance to take part in the Olympics. Cancelling the Winter Games would not be fair on competitors or on the Chinese people, who are not responsible for their government’s atrocities. And the Olympics offers a platform not only to the host nation, but to all athletes. From the two black American athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, raising their black-gloved fists in solidarity with oppressed black and minority ethnic people across the world in 1968, to 2016’s first refugee Olympic team. Team GB should be free to focus on doing their job: competing to the highest possible standard and winning medals. Their very presence at the Winter Olympics provides a platform for the values that Labour wants to inform Britain’s role in the world: security, prosperity and respect. But media coverage of the Games should recognise the context in which they are taking place, including highlighting the horrific human rights situation in China. Our politicians and diplomats are rightly staying at home, but this does not mean they should stay silent. They should raise these issues publicly and in international forums. The public should feel pride in Britain’s athletes, but also in our nation’s values, by standing up for fundamental rights, and showing solidarity with the oppressed in China. The Conservatives are divided on China and have no clear strategy. After years of boosterish talk of a “golden era” of British-Chinese relations, during which the UK became the largest recipient of Chinese investment in Europe while turning a blind eye to human rights and security concerns, the government has performed a series of U-turns. While the foreign secretary tries to talk tough, the chancellor is trying to cash cheques and chase investment regardless of sensitivities. They even opposed an effort to ensure Britain doesn’t sign trade deals with countries believed to be committing genocide. Where the government is failing to act, Labour has a plan. It starts with a complete audit of the UK-China relationship, as well as bringing new measures to help UK businesses to ensure their supply chains do not include workers subject to human rights violations and to ban the products of forced labour. We would extend targeted sanctions against Chinese officials directly responsible for persecution and redouble diplomatic efforts to allow the UN unfettered access to Xinjiang. The government needs to take a strong, clear-eyed and consistent approach to China, seeking to cooperate where we can on climate change and global health while standing firm on human rights, freedom and security. We should cheer for our stars but we must not forget that the Winter Olympics is an important moment for Britain to stand up for our values. We must not turn a blind eye to genocide.

2/6/2022,"When the Troubles kicked off in Belfast in August 1969, Kenneth Branagh was eight years old. He recalls cowering under a table with his mother and his older brother as paving stones were torn from the street and hurled through the windows of their Catholic neighbours. Ciarán Hinds was away on holiday in the countryside, and only found out what was going on when his father, a doctor, phoned to say he wouldn’t be joining the family for his usual week, because he felt honour-bound to stay and tend to his patients. Branagh was from working-class Protestant stock, while Hinds was a 16-year-old former altar boy from a Catholic family, whose school was close to the Branagh house. Though they never knew each other, they would have gone to the same cinema, hung out in the same park, and suffered the same Sunday doldrums. “Belfast Sunday evening, you know, was a grim time,” says Branagh. Even the kids’ playground in the park was shut, Hinds adds: “And not only was the playground locked, but each individual swing was too, and the roundabout was padlocked.” “It was savage, wasn’t it?” chips in Branagh. “Brutal, brutal!” sighs Hinds, shaking his head in mock disbelief.  Spruced up for a photocall at an upmarket hotel in London, in the final publicity push for Branagh’s semi-autobiographical film Belfast, they have the easy banter of two drinking buddies enjoying the craic over a Guinness in an Irish pub. But, though they went on to the same London drama school – Rada – it has taken more than half a century for them to get together to process an experience that ushered in decades of bloodshed, and deeply affected each of them in different ways. “When the new school term started, there was this sense of a major elemental change,” says Hinds, whose family stayed in Belfast through the Troubles. The Branaghs, meanwhile, emigrated to the English town of Reading, driven out – the film suggests – by an increasingly vicious with-us-or-against-us culture on the streets around their home. Belfast is dedicated to “those who stayed, those who left and all those who were lost”. The Troubles are not the only bit of history that has shaped this most personal film. Branagh started work on Belfast in March 2020, emerging from his shed after his first day’s writing to find Boris Johnson on television announcing the lockdown. “I’ve always known that the separation from Ireland, and the separation from a settled sense of knowing who you were, was a big thing in my life,” he says. “I knew that I wanted to write about it, but didn’t know what the story would be or who it would be for. And I suppose it was really the lockdown that unleashed a way to tell it, because, particularly at the beginning of it, so many people from all parts of the world, who I hadn’t seen for a while, got in contact, really wanting to know how you were and what you were doing, and I was doing the same thing. It sent me back to that sense of this story being about separation, and whether, in the telling of it, you could reconnect to something that was permanent, and not merely an exercise in sentimentality or nostalgia.” Six months later Hinds was in Lyon, where his partner, Hélène Patarot, was rehearsing a play, when his agent got in touch to say Branagh wanted to fix up a Zoom call. “Ken said, ‘Would you mind if I sent you the script?’ I managed not to shout ‘Would I mind?’ And a few pages in, something just connected, deep back into the core of the home that you’ve left; at the root of it was the authenticity, and the fun and the spark and the soul.” As “Pop” – the grandfather of nine-year-old Buddy – Hinds is a back-yard philosopher who dispenses advice – and maths homework – from a throne on the outside toilet, while the formidable Granny (Judi Dench) sits at the window, listening in, with a put-down always to hand. There is a 19-year age gap between Hinds and Dench. “I said: ‘I’ll age up and you age down and we’ll meet in the middle,” he says. The part of Buddy is played by Jude Hill, who was just nine when the film was shot. The perspective and palette of the film is shaped around his ardent awkwardness, its monochrome broken by flashes of brilliant colour as he sits with Granny in the cinema, eyes wide in delight as Raquel Welch and Dick Van Dyke romp across the screen in One Million Years BC and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He competes with a maths geek for the attention of a clever Catholic girl in his class, is lured into a gang and coerced into joining a shoplifting raid on the local corner shop, escaping with a single bar of turkish delight, which nobody likes. How true to life are these dramatic anecdotes? Well, says Branagh, his father was a joiner like Buddy’s, who was often away working in England, and he did compete for the attentions of a Catholic classmate with another boy who was much better than him at maths. In the run-up to filming, he took the company on a tour of Belfast, which included a visit to the house in which the girl used to live. He has no idea if she would have any memory of him: “She probably only remembers the maths geek.” There also really was a cornershop called Mr Singh’s, where he once got involved in a shoplifting escapade. “The turkish delight episode is mortifyingly true. It was all I could bloody well grab. Mr Singh’s was at the bottom of the street, so it was madness. Just a few hours later a real copper turns up at our house thinking ‘I’ll give five minutes to scaring the living bejaysus out of this kid’ – with the full approval of my mother. I had to explain to Jude about the old way of policing – that if you saw a cop car outside the house it could only mean one thing.” For those who witnessed Branagh’s spectacular rise in the 1980s – playing Henry V for the RSC while still in his early 20s and then setting up his own Renaissance company, enabling him to reprise his performance on film five years later – his account of his early years comes as a surprise. By the time Branagh emerged from drama school, Hinds was a regular at Glasgow Citizens theatre – “a working-class people’s theatre doing an incredible European repertoire, which seemed to have every exciting young actor in the country: there’s this fellow called Ciarán Hinds, a bloke called Gary Oldman, and another one called Mark Rylance,” says Branagh. “And I couldn’t get an audition for love nor money. Then John Boorman’s Excalibur arrived with another tide of Irish actors, and Ciarán was there again. He’s always been right in the middle of those waves.” Hinds, meanwhile, had his own outsider narrative going on. “It’s very funny because in our generation there were hardly any of us,” he says, though he had been friends with Liam Neeson since they started acting together in amateur productions in their teens. Though his major roles have mainly been in the theatre – he met his partner, the French-Vietnamese actor Hélène Patarot, while working on Peter Brook’s Mahabharata in 1987 – he has worked with Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, and was ranked 31st in an Irish Times list of all-time great Irish film actors in 2020 (one ahead of his Belfast co-star Jamie Dornan). To see the two men together is to witness the yin and yang of a successful life in showbusiness: the reliably good and quietly in-demand character actor, who has combined a blue-chip career with nice little earners in blockbusters such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones (“I never think: ‘I want to play that role.’ My mind doesn’t work that way,” Hinds has said), and the mover and shaker, who has made a speciality of directing himself in starring roles. When the doors did open for Branagh his origins were nowhere to be seen. He was the new Laurence Olivier, heir to a tradition of great actor managers, whose power matches, first with Emma Thompson and then with Helena Bonham Carter, meant he was seldom out of the gossip columns. The memories tumble out of him. “Can you now imagine, having seen this film, how discombobulating it was for me?” he demands. “Not to deal with the work – the work was amazing, and to have a chance to make a film of Henry V and have our own theatre company and everything. I woke up this morning with this incredible sense memory of 1 February 1988, Borough Market rehearsal room, Much Ado About Nothing, with Judi Dench directing and me playing Benedick. I just remember I was as happy as a sandboy. Almost from the time I left Belfast, that was the first time I felt: ‘God this is it. I’m in a family, and with somebody who knows what they’re doing. We trust each other. We’re doing an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay.’ “Then cut to a year later and suddenly you’ve made a film of Henry V and there’s a bit of a pre-digital world media storm. So you’re in way too many newspapers. You’re annoying the bejaysus out of plenty of people. And it was completely at odds with the background I came from, so I dealt with it as best I could. It wasn’t so much impostor syndrome, just that I never needed or asked for the rest of it. I knew you had to bang the drum and you couldn’t be churlish with people, but you paid a price.” He stresses that he’s not playing the victim card. “I’m sure I said and did some stupid things, but I was always a devotee and an enthusiast, so the real me was always watching your man here [he nods at Hinds], or people like him that I admired, and thinking: ‘God, isn’t it amazing what they’re doing.’ For me, the thing about being famous, or a star or a personality, was that I didn’t really know quite how to handle it. And I’m sure I mishandled it. And now of course, I couldn’t give a monkey’s about it because life’s too short to worry about that kind of thing. And I’m back to enjoying the work.” Belfast has already won him a Golden Globe for best original screenplay and last week was nominated for six Baftas, including best film. It looks set for a good showing at the Oscars, but a reminder of that other sort of notoriety came the day before our interview, when a little social media storm blew up over a newspaper column suggesting that Jamie Dornan, who plays Buddy’s “Pa”, was too good-looking to pass for a working-class joiner from 1960s Belfast. “Could you get in touch with [the writer] and say that we need a word with him? Because that’s possibly insulting to the men of Belfast,” riffs Hinds, in his best barroom heavy drawl. “Just possibly insulting to my father,” laughs Branagh. “Yeah,” says Hinds, “that would certainly be insulting. Gorgeous man.” Joking aside, they agree that the furore cast light on the architecture of the film. Buddy’s Pa is a glamorous figure to his son, who elides the heroes he sees on family cinema outings with the semi-stranger who rides into town once a fortnight bearing gifts. “The film is rife with the vocabulary of what we would have seen in cinemas quite close to each other, but through a nine-year-old’s eyes,” says Branagh. “The stories that helped him frame the way the world was came out of westerns and glamourised figures on the screen. And he’s at that age when you hope and want your parents to match up to John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart – or Gary Cooper, who was all that plus sensitive.” Part of the point of sticking so closely to the young boy’s perspective, adds Branagh, was that the film didn’t have to paint a political picture, “because that’s not what the boy saw: what he saw was small-scale intimidation, the beginnings of a kind of gangsterism, and at that stage he wasn’t in a position to see higher political causes. So it inevitably has a narrowness of perspective, which means that you can get away without doing what many mightier minds than mine have done, which is to fall prey to believing that it is right and proper to try and explain everything.” Hinds still has sisters in Belfast, though he lives between Paris and London and has visited less frequently since his mother died a few years ago. It’s a very different city today, he says. “You really don’t want things to break out again. I would despair if they did. But as we know, it only takes a single match to strike a tinderbox. I’m hoping that in a few years’ time, the British public will see sense and vote to go back into Europe. It’s not about surrendering. It’s got to do with understanding that things might take longer than you think, and having patience and thinking further ahead to what it means to generations to come.” As simple as it sounds, adds Branagh, the message of the film is summed up by Buddy’s Pa, after the little boy solemnly asks if there could ever be a future for him and his Catholic classmate. “Pa says: ‘She could be a vegetarian antichrist for all I care. But if you respect each other, and you’re kind, then they’re welcome in our house any day of the week.’ So the film is a plea, really, for what I hope the future holds, which is open communication, understanding, respect, tolerance – all the things that are easy to say, and hard to do. But the prize at the end of that is peace and prosperity. I think that’s worth going for.” Belfast is in cinemas now",Arts/Culture,Branagh and Hinds: two Belfast boys on childhood and the Troubles,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/06/kenneth-branagh-and-ciaran-hinds-belfast-boys-on-growing-up-across-the-divide
2/6/2022,"The news that Newcastle Cathedral is going to host monthly comedy nights, complete with “full bar” and merchandise outlet, has annoyed a former chaplain to the Queen. Dr Gavin Ashenden described it as “a misuse” and feared the “awesome” cathedral would be reduced to “an O2 Arena or a nightclub”. “If the diocese of Newcastle wants to have comedians, it should hire a comedy club,” he said, “but to do it in a cathedral is offensive to everyone who thinks a cathedral is a holy space.” I like comedy but it’s hard to immediately dismiss this view. You imagine a comedy gig-style lighting state, all reds and greens and lager brand gobos flickering up the walls, and it all feeling somehow diabolical in the context of shadowy gothic architecture. And then in the middle, the confident standup, spotlit, microphone in hand, swearing and talking about being dumped and saying that the statues of the saints look like paedos. The raucous laughter echoing up the nave, spilt beer trickling into the lettering of the memorial flagstones, while the comedian perches a buttock on the altar and goes into his bit about internet porn.  I’ve never liked those bars or clubs that exist in deconsecrated Victorian churches or chapels. It feels a bit sad, the spiritual hopes of the people who commissioned and built those dignified places dashed nightly, their confidence and piety made foolish by the passing of time, as punters drink or dance or rush to the new lean-to toilet block. They’re fine buildings whose congregations have long scattered, and so logically they should be used, but a part of me feels that demolition would be kinder to the memory of the long-dead worshippers who once filled them. So is Ashenden right when he says that, by allowing David O’Doherty’s forthcoming gig, the Church of England has shown “spiritual illiteracy”? It’s a catchy phrase, no less than you’d expect from a media-savvy former cleric, though I’m not sure what it actually means. At first glance, it really feels like it means something insightful but then you look at it for a bit longer and no more meaning is forthcoming. I reckon it just means he thinks the church has done something bad and so he’s saying it in a vaguely religious and ecclesiastical way to suit the mood. It’s the same instinct that might cause someone to compliment a particularly delicious plate of haggis by putting on a comedy Scottish accent. I feel I’m uniquely placed to opine on this issue because I actually performed at a comedy gig in a cathedral a week ago. Perhaps “performed” is putting it a bit strongly. I chatted. It was part of the Bristol Slapstick festival and I was interviewed about my favourite bits of slapstick from film and TV, in front of a big screen to show the clips, in Bristol Cathedral. My wife, who was in the audience, says she isn’t sure if there was a bar. But she said she really enjoyed the evening so I think there must have been. I thought it was a lovely event: Bristol’s annual festival celebrating silent and physical comedy, having weathered the existential threat of lockdown, returning triumphantly to its audience of pratfall enthusiasts. And while its usual venue, the Bristol Beacon, is being refurbished, it was welcomed into the most ancient of the city’s indoor spaces, its medieval cathedral. It was a happy atmosphere, with vergers wearing the regalia of the cathedral mingling with festival volunteers in their slapstick-branded sweatshirts, everyone enthusiastic about the hundreds of people who were arriving, and anxious for the show to be a success. We ended the evening with a tribute to the wonderful Barry Cryer, who had died a couple of days earlier. So was it “offensive to everyone who thinks a cathedral is a holy space”? I’m not very religious, but neither am I an atheist. I’m a “don’t know”. I hope there’s a nice big God, and I hope I find myself believing in one when I expire, but I don’t reckon thinking about it a lot is going to give me the answer. I like churches, though – I find them both calming and moving, a combination rarely achieved by TV drama. During the event, I was extremely pleased to be in a cathedral. Would Ashenden say that was irrelevant because I’m not a practising Anglican? Presumably not because neither is he any more. Though formerly a priest of the Church of England, he has subsequently changed service provider and is now a Roman Catholic. He says he left the C of E because of its “capitulation to the increasingly intense and non-negotiable demands of a secular culture”. I understand his frustration. Religion, many people think, is supposed to offer clarity: rules and salvation. Eternal and unchanging truths. The woolly and hand-wringing Church of England, the state religion of an increasingly irreligious state, coping with declining congregations and disintegrating architecture, might seem like a poor excuse for a belief system compared with its muscular and unwavering rivals. Far from converting people to its doctrines, it seems more concerned with accommodating the faithless. Maybe that’s why I like it. To me, the troubled, thoughtful and well-meaning fogginess of the C of E feels much more truthful, a much more comprehensible and sane reflection of how the human condition feels, than all those more dynamic philosophies. Other religions may have retained the fiery naivety of youth, but the Anglican church has the mild and tolerant befuddlement of experience, which is the closest thing to wisdom that I’ll ever believe in. And it has all these amazing buildings. Why not take as a starting point that people should be going inside them, for whatever reason? They should be part of our lives. They are beautiful and imbued with centuries of faith, but also of politics and compromise and hypocrisy. Bristol Cathedral was an abbey before Henry VIII took a shine to a younger woman. It’s a cathedral because of a midlife crisis. That doesn’t feel like an entirely inappropriate venue for comedy.",Opinion/Opinion,Having a laugh in church?

Mind you, just as she didn’t consent to the release of the tape (a hedonistic sex marathon believed to generate $77m), nor did she give her blessing to this series, which is something to consider as the eight episodes unfold. The tone verges on hyperreal – at one point Lee’s penis talks, bobbing away like a CGI-uncooked sausage – but the people are real.  Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) directs the first three episodes and also executive produces. What saves Pam & Tommy from disappearing beneath a churning sea of retrospective-“ick” is a crisp script from Robert Siegel (The Wrestler) – Lee shouting: “I’m going to be a dad. On purpose” – and bravura performances. Lily James is transformed into Pam with hairpieces, fake teeth and prosthetics, including breasts so gargantuan, female viewers may be thinking less of sex than of biting bra straps and backache. Initially there’s the fear that James is going to play Anderson as a human pout, a pinkie-chewing 90s Marilyn Monroe in denim cut-off shorts, but as the nightmare develops, so does her vulnerability and anger. As Lee (tattooed, jockstrapped, strutting around his Malibu mansion waving a gun), Sebastian Stan (Captain America: The First Avenger) goes full cartoon LA rock star, though in fairness, so do most LA rock stars. Seth Rogen (who helped develop the project) is fine as the appallingly treated workman who steals the tape, but we see far too much of him: his justifications, his regret, his being ripped off too, his interest in theology… enough already! Indeed, after lively opening episodes, the series starts to struggle as it gets into legal actions resulting from the leaking of the tape. This show seems to want to be viewed in the same light as Paul Thomas Anderson’s 1997 porn-set masterpiece Boogie Nights, but the piquant blend of sleaze and heart isn’t quite there. James is dynamite though: Anderson is portrayed not as a Barbie doll having a tantrum, but as a real hurting woman. For the shock of the illicit, the first of BBC Two’s two-part documentary Mary Beard’s Forbidden Art delivered arty obscenities and cultural nasties by the shovelful: penises galore, war atrocities, incest, bestiality. It wasn’t long before I was so burnt out and desensitised, a full-blown multi-species orgy could have erupted at the other end of the sofa and I’d have just sighed and chucked over some wet wipes. This was an engrossing documentary in which the Cambridge University professor of classics examined not only banned works, but also art that people choose to look away from. Tracey Emin spoke candidly about her oeuvre, detailing her assaults, abortions and cancer: “If I go through hell, I make paintings about hell.” Turner prize winner Martin Creed showed videos depicting people first vomiting, then defecating on to the floor (shocking – no one wiped). Daphne Todd won the BP portrait award in 2010 for her painting of her 100-year-old mother shortly after her death. Todd stopped painting her after three days, saying: “I didn’t want it to get to a point where there was a smell, I suppose.” Even Beard blanched at that one. A 10-part Starzplay adaptation of Emily St John Mandel’s 2014 bestseller, Station Eleven, adapted by Patrick Somerville, arrives bearing a spookily familiar theme. A virus destroys the world’s population, and years later, a troupe of thespians travel around, foraging, surviving, performing the works of Shakespeare, keeping the spirit of creativity alive. I wasn’t optimistic (foraging hippy troupes? I’ve done my time at Glastonbury), but a few episodes in, I’m finding Station Eleven richly themed and intriguing. This is about wars of the outer and inner world (love and hope versus evil and menace). In the virus scenes, it’s inky in its darkness: dead people slump over workstations; a plane crashes in a long, slow moment; snow-blanketed cars are marooned in a motionless jam. Danielle Deadwyler is haunting as the heartbroken, demotivated author of a graphic novel called Station Eleven. Mackenzie Davis is raw and credible as Kirsten, who was a child actor performing on stage in King Lear when the plague struck and the lead (Gael García Bernal) died. Kirsten goes on to become one of the Shakespearean performers, but is she too zealous about protecting the troupe at all costs? At times, Station Eleven becomes choked up on themes, time zones and characters, and liberties have been taken with reality: in this post-civilisation, everybody has straight white teeth – clearly all the dentists survived. Still, especially considering our own recent history, this is meaty, absorbing fare, with a true sense of global and personal catastrophe. Sometimes a documentary sharply nudges you awake and makes you look at things differently. Seyi Rhodes’s hardworking Channel 4 documentary Race and Medical Experiments: What’s the Truth? did just that. An examination of heightened vaccine hesitancy among ethnic minorities, it took a forensic look at why some people of colour harbour an ingrained distrust of science and medicine. Rhodes travelled to the US to relate some grim history. In Tuskegee, Alabama, black people with syphilis were treated as experiments and allowed to die, even though a cure was available. Among other outrages, he also looked into the 20th-century testing of mustard gas on hundreds of British and Indian soldiers. Rhodes, who is vaccinated himself, steered this shocking documentary with calm authority, explaining how people of colour were helping one another overcome their deep-set hesitancy. This was a sobering, valuable hour shining a bright torch into a dark area.

2/6/2022,"The news that one more prominent man in the world of media has been forced to resign over a sex scandal barely warrants the raise of an eyebrow these days, but it is noteworthy if he resigns because there was sex with no scandal. This was the case for Jeff Zucker, now ex-president of CNN, who stepped down last week after it was revealed that he was romantically involved with a colleague, Allison Gollust. While Zucker’s resignation has prompted speculation about political machinations behind the scenes, it’s hard to see what he actually did wrong. The relationship was consensual; both Zucker and Gollust are divorced and of a similar age (he’s 56, she’s 49). By Zucker’s own admission, his fault was the failure to disclose the relationship when it began, in line with company policy. Much as it pains me to agree with Fox News host Bill Maher, he had a point when he remarked: “This used to be called discretion.”  So is the office romance now a resigning offence? According to one 2017 study, 11% of people met their long-term partner at work, compared with 19% in 1995. There are generations coming of age now that will find it impossible to imagine a world before the advent of dating apps, but for those of us of Gen X and older, work was one of the places you might reliably hope to meet people with similar interests, abilities or outlooks. It’s a staple of sitcoms: the tentative flirtation between Tim and Dawn in The Office struck a chord with millions of viewers because there can be few adults who have not sought to leaven the tedium of another work day with an exchange of glances, in-jokes or “accidental” encounters at the coffee machine with an attractive colleague. Perhaps it’s still a generational thing; season one of And Just Like That…, the reboot of Sex and the City, ended with 55-year-old Carrie snogging her boss in the lift at work. Even if it doesn’t lead anywhere, the office flirtation can offer a welcome bright spot in a long day; one more harmless pleasure the pandemic has stolen from us. Or is it harmless? Perhaps more than any other intimate relationship, the office romance is open to abuse because of the implications for careers and livelihoods. There were those, mostly men, who lamented that the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements sounded the death knell for office flirtations, as companies increasingly tightened their policies around workplace relationships, a move welcomed by many women weary of their male bosses’ and colleagues’ inability to distinguish between compliments and harassment. Facebook and Google now have a rule that employees can ask a co-worker out only once; if they’re turned down, any subsequent attempt could be a disciplinary matter. Maybe the office romance has become so fraught that it should be consigned to history. After all, home-working, Zoom and the recent dearth of work parties everywhere except Downing Street have more or less killed it off entirely. For many Britons, the idea of “love contracts”, as implemented by some US companies, would be excruciating; most of us would rather be celibate forever than sit in front of an HR manager with a colleague we’ve started shagging to sign legal disclaimers about professional behaviour and declarations that neither party was coerced. I confess that I’m on the side of workplace romances: I owe my existence to one. My parents met teaching at the same school and continued to work happily together as colleagues until they both retired. Of course, policies that protect younger and more vulnerable employees from exploitation are a necessary step towards equality and respect, but it’s also important that companies trust workers to manage their professional and personal lives as consenting adults. I’m wary of any policy that would force people to choose between their relationship and their job; in the case of Zucker and Gollust, he took the rap, but it’s easy to see how women could end up disproportionately affected by such rules. And if the history of art, literature and human behaviour has taught us anything, it’s that attempting to forbid romantic liaisons only makes them more attractive.

2/6/2022,"As Thitsar* walked through her neighbourhood one December morning, she was struck by its emptiness. The bamboo shacks that line the streets of Hlaing Tharyar, an industrial township on the outskirts of Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, lay in tatters, overgrown with weeds. The vendors who once weaved through traffic had vanished, as had many of the informal settlements where they lived and the roadside tea shops where they gathered. Streets that had once resounded with chants for democracy were now eerily silent.  The scene was nearly unrecognisable from just 10 months earlier, when Hlaing Tharyar was a hotbed of resistance following the 1 February military coup which overthrew the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. Over the past decade, Myanmar’s manufacturing and garment industry saw huge growth, much of it centred in Hlaing Tharyar. Hundreds of thousands of women and men from farming backgrounds flocked to the township to work in its factories, many of which supplied clothes to international brands. When the coup happened, these factory workers came out in full force to resist. Garment workers led Yangon’s first protests on 6 February, and continued demonstrating even as many were fired from their jobs. By late February, soldiers were regularly shooting protesters. On 14 March, hundreds of soldiers and police surrounded protesters and fired at them with assault rifles, killing at least 66 people, which Human Rights Watch described as a massacre. The crackdowns, along with a spiralling economic downturn, caused a mass exodus of Hlaing Tharyar’s factory workers back to their rural villages. Fighting in the countryside is now raging between armed civilian anti-coup groups and the military, which is responding with arson, airstrikes, shelling and other indiscriminate attacks. One year on, those who remain in Hlaing Tharyar are struggling just to survive. The coup and accompanying violence and instability have left the garment sector in tatters. Poverty and food insecurity have climbed. The UN Development Programme has offered grim forecasts, including that urban poverty would triple by this year compared with 2019 levels and that overall poverty rates would return to levels not seen since 2005. Thitsar remembers Hlaing Tharyar’s week of terror last March, when she hid with her aunt. “We barricaded ourselves inside until everything was over,” she says. Now she is out of a job. After months of falling orders, her factory closed in September. Meanwhile, food prices have risen by about 30%, she says. She is now clinging to the hope that her factory will reopen. Even those still in work face a range of hardships. On 3 September, two prominent unions accused employers of “taking advantage of the coup” to sack workers, target union leaders and drive down wages. Than Htun*, another garment worker in Hlaing Tharyar, actively protested in February, but returned to work after several co-workers were fired for going on strike. He says workers were routinely coerced into taking extra shifts, overtime pay has been cut and workers have been made to sleep in an unfinished building next to the factory in case of sudden labour inspections. Military officers and local officials have since forcibly evicted more than 8,000 families and destroyed their homes, according to research by University College London. People in Hlaing Tharyar are also living under a cloud of fear caused by a rise in explosions and killings, carried out by both military-sponsored vigilante militias and anti-coup urban guerrilla groups which have increased across the country since June. In December alone, the township suffered at least 16 explosions in five incidents targeting police stations and military bases, according to a tally of local media reports and announcements from guerrilla groups carried out by the Guardian. Military informants are also ubiquitous, as are random checkpoints where soldiers and police inspect people’s belongings and the contents of their phones. For Thitsar, these changes have made her fearful of even going outside for everyday errands. “There are arbitrary shootings and explosions. If there’s a conflict, anyone can get caught in the middle,” she says. For Than Htun, the neighbourhood is unrecognisable. Market stalls now shut by 8pm, while all-day electricity cuts have become common as public boycotts of electricity bills squeeze the junta’s revenues. Sometimes, the streets are completely dark when he finishes his shift at 7pm. As the military increases surveillance around the country, he feels as if he is always being watched. “Even when I’m in my own room, I feel the need to wear earphones when listening to the news. It’s like I’m in a strange land.” * Names have been changed to protect their identity Nway is a freelance reporter based in Yangon.

2/6/2022,"Levelling up secretary Michael Gove last week unveiled the government’s long-delayed plans to address regional and social inequalities, but cash-strapped councils across England are having to plan heavy cuts to frontline services after more than a decade of ongoing austerity. Recent funding increases have not undone £15bn of cuts in central government grants to local authorities between 2010 and 2020, and councils wrestling with the impact of Covid are set to pass a succession of savings measures plus widespread council tax increases. Several local authorities are facing votes on service cuts in the coming weeks. Nottingham is planning cuts to youth services, with all play schemes axed and a move toward targeted rather than universal provision. Its Early Help service would see a reduction in staffing and early intervention for families. Funding for its Base 51 youth centre, which provides services including counselling and crisis support, would be axed. Six of the city’s nine children’s centres would close from 2023.  Sandwell in the West Midlands is reviewing the respite support it provides, to allow unpaid carers such as family members a much-needed break while the person they care for is looked after by someone else. Sandwell plans to halve this from 56 days a year to 28, which the council admits “will reduce the level of service offered”. It is also planning to increase the amount adult care users pay for non-residential care. Kent is planning to cut more than £2m from subsidised bus services, with some contracts potentially terminating. The cost of a school bus discount pass will rise by £80 a year, and by £30 for children receiving free school meals. The council is also planning to cut travel concessions for those accompanying disabled people. Liverpool is planning to cut funding for community organisations that run three libraries: they took these over from the council in 2015 to save them from closure. Hartlepool is planning to end free home-to-school transport for 16- to 19-year-olds with special education needs and disabilities (Send). Support may be axed for current students or perhaps just for new starters. Croydon is planning to save more than £1m a year through reviews of care packages for disabled and elderly people and those with mental health needs. Other councils are explicitly looking to save money by reviewing high-cost care packages. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the government was increasing councils’ “core spending power” by 4% and “providing the largest cash-terms increase in grant funding in 10 years”.",News/Society,What levelling up?

2/6/2022,"For the first time in a long time, I’ve been reading my own columns from the start. The impetus came when a friend reached out to say he’d started doing so, on account of his imminent fatherhood. Going over the early articles might, he said, give him a sense of things to come. I was cheered by this, because I am extremely vain, but also slightly embarrassed since he’d worked out to do this before I had, now that I face the prospect of another baby and a startling lack of memory about how it should be cared for. I simply can’t remember much about the early days of fatherhood, because I wrote about the experiences of rearing an actual baby while I was rearing an actual baby. It’s a time in one’s life where memory undergoes a dark age. Stress, sleep deprivation and the constant buffeting of immediate, short-term goals means there are entire months that might only be retrieved from my brain via hypnosis.  This time four years ago, on the other hand, I’d been reading books, buying a small arsenal of clothes, accessories and equipment, cleaning and re-cleaning our house until it squeaked and gleamed like one of those crime labs you see in films. This time out, I haven’t bought a single new piece of clothing, would sooner resit my maths GCSE than read another book about parenting, and the combination of two years spent with both of us working from home, and the grubby ambulations of our three-and-a-half year old son, have precluded our house from being any more hygienic than one of those crime scenes you see in films. We do, of course, have some reason to be less worried. We’ve done it once before and, grubbiness and tantrums aside, he’s mostly turned out all right. He was also the last baby to be born on either side of the family for a couple of years, and this inherited an unprecedented jackpot in hand-me-downs so our ceiling now bulges with baby toys, gadgets and clothes. But the day and daily of child-rearing feels distant and hard to conjure. So, here I sit, wading back through old columns to see if they can stand me in better stead, only to be found wanting. Not by the words themselves, of course – even I am rendered powerless by my trademark mix of gentle humour and wry observation. No, by the fact that I failed to create a step-by-step guide to baby care, and chronicled instead my boring old thoughts and feelings about the ordeal. Overall, I’m stunned by the hubris. Of watching a guy, week by week, learning how little he knows, but always without realising that the frontiers of his ignorance will be stretched back further still by the following week. To some extent, perhaps, it’s cheering; to watch this blundering moron fail, but fail upwards, step by step. If he could do it, I reckon, so can I.

2/6/2022,"Ai Weiwei, 64, must qualify by now as a grand old man of contemporary art except that as a sculptor, photographer and documentary film-maker, he is characterised by unflagging energy and youthful playfulness. As a child, he lived in a dugout in China’s “Little Siberia” where his poet father, Ai Qing, had been banished, condemned as a “rightist”. In 2011, he was “disappeared” for 81 days in a Chinese jail and then spent four years under house arrest. In 2015, he left China and has since lived in Berlin, Cambridge and Portugal. His latest show at Kettle’s Yard, The Liberty of Doubt, exhibits Chinese antiquities – bought in 2020 at a Cambridge auction sale – alongside his own work. You seem always to have been interested in what constitutes a fake and even once described yourself as simultaneously “sincere and insincere”?I talk about fakes all the time. My architecture company in China is called Fake. People joke and say: the only real company, producing real stuff, in China is “Fake”. I thought maybe I’d do a show about authenticity. I’ve been a collector of Chinese antiquities for 30 years, I used to look for them in thousands of shops in China. I enjoyed it because every piece is a mystery. The Cambridge auction happened when I was driving to Portugal. I told my partner to use her garage to store the works – they arrived badly wrapped in newspaper. I realised that many were not authentic but they were not badly made. They were super-good – perfect – except that they did not have the patina of 500 years ago. Then I showed them to friends, one of whom, a retired top US dealer, said: “Weiwei, it is all fake.” Another friend who sells antiques in China said: “Not only is this fake, I even know who made it.” And I thought: this is interesting.  There is a 2020 work in the show of a toilet roll made out of marble (2020). Do you like using valuable materials ironically?Playfulness is so important – I think I am like a cat. Cats are always wondering. If you throw a paper ball to a cat, it can play for a whole day…. Life is a serious matter, but also ironic. When marble was used in the past, it had a monumental or memorialising status. Toilet paper disappeared from the shelves during the pandemic. This is a society in which we can send a shuttle into outer space yet cannot solve a humble problem – the moment deserved to be remembered. In your autobiography, you write of your “wilful tendency to let the dice fall where they may” – does that streak of gambling and opportunism contribute to your art?The first intention of life itself is to grab something. It is like a drunk person having to grab something to hold on to… grabbing reflects my mind: as an artist, if I don’t grab something, I might as well be dead. It is my inner need to do that. To what extent have the years spent living in the dugout influenced your life? What did they teach you about survival? And what did being dirt-poor teach you about riches?My father was a poet, and the word “money” never came out of his mouth. He was such a pure man. What mattered was imagination and the spiritual and the daily practice of language. This time was a training in understanding that nothing belongs to you except your mind and your health. The rest is illusion. If I look back, it was an extremely difficult time. If you look at my iPhone, I have this image of the dugout… it was in a vast, vast desert – the Gobi desert – with no sign of life. But we survived. We survived the lack of material things. We also had to protect our dignity from total insult and discrimination – but I didn’t really pay much very attention until much later. That time taught me how low humanity can go. And at what point in your life did you start to feel a spirit of resistance in yourself?When I started to research the students who died in the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, right before the Olympics opened [the Chinese government censored and controlled all information about the earthquake]. Piece by piece, we found them – the names, schools and universities of 5,219 students. I felt desperate at that time. I felt I could collapse at any moment and I knew the authorities could make me disappear easily. What would your father have made of your success had he lived to see it?He died in 1996. I went back [to China] from New York in 1993. I was trying to stay calmly in China – doing nothing, sometimes playing poker with my brother, just to be there as his son. I knew the time was getting closer and one night we came to the hospital and he had passed away. We didn’t have very close relations, we were together all the time but didn’t have that much communication. He had been tragic in his life. His mind was always somewhere else. He never wanted me to become an artist. He was tolerant that I did art, but knew what art was like in China, that it could bring all kinds of trouble. He had been punished by doing poetry – so he did not encourage nor try to stop me. He would never have imagined that I would become a well-known artist. Do you think your son, Ai Lao, has the artistic or poetic gene?He is 13, and I think my son has better potential than me – I was very late in recognising I could do some art but he, I can see, is very creative and with a strong mind and good skill. But I am not sure he would want to become an artist. And I don’t give him any advice. One of your films that will be part of the exhibition is Human Flow (2017), about the refugee crisis. I imagine you must have keen fellow feeling for the refugees…To be a refugee, you have to give up everything: your language, first; your people, your culture, even your religion. It is never a clear choice. I can understand their courage to give up everything in exchange for their children’s future. And many courageous people lose their lives on the way to their destination. That’s a price they are paying… They need safety and to be helped and treated with compassion and to be told “here you can stay”, but we don’t even give that possibility, and that makes me really frustrated. They ask so little and are giving up so much. Could you ever envisage living in China again?I’d love to go back. My mum is almost 90 and thinks about me and my safety but tells me: do not come back. I take her words seriously. No mum tells her son: “do not come back”, but she is sincere because of what she experienced when I was disappeared. In the whole nation, no one could give her one sentence about where I was and that made her older by many years so that, when I came out, I could see all the worry and absence of sleep marked on her face. This morning, knowing I was interviewing you, a headline leapt out at me: where is Chinese tennis champion Peng Shuai?She is in the very safe hands of the Communist party. They will make sure she behaves exactly according to the party. She may already be thinking she made a mistake in exposing this very deep, dark relationship. She has put her family, friends, career at stake. There is no spirit for her any more. She has become another person, and whatever she tells you is not true. I know your work involves many people – how many do you employ regularly in your team and is it really true, as you often modestly argue, that you are mostly the ideas man nowadays?We have about 30 people – mostly, they find me. Many have been with me 10, 20 or even 30 years. Once we were together, we became like a family. We live together and have fun. I have survived a difficult life and I am a very handy person – my hands are always working. If your hands are not working, your brain is not going to function. I am very capable: carpentry, stone, iron. I have also become skilful on social media. Everything is about the continuity of learning, and learning comes from curiosity. Does your energy ever flag?I have much less energy, which is natural when you are getting older. My older dog always takes a nap while my younger dog runs round with more curiosity. But when you do something you believe in, it attracts you and you are part of it. You borrow your energy from others.
