1/19/2022,"The owner of Bristol Energy has gone bust weeks after the struggling council-owned supplier assured its customers that the business was stable despite record-high gas market prices. The energy regulator, Ofgem, will appoint a new supplier to take on the 176,000 households affected by the collapse of its parent company, Together Energy, which is part-owned by Warrington borough council.  The energy company was forced to deny press reports earlier this year that it was on the brink of calling in administrators and told customers that the company was “stable” and operating on a “business as usual” basis. Bristol Energy said it was “saddened” to announce its exit from the UK’s energy market but it was “untenable for us to continue”. It also denied press reports that suggested it had not bought enough gas and electricity to meet its customers’ needs. Together’s collapse makes it the 27th energy supplier to go bust since gas market prices began a steep ascent to record highs in August last year, leaving more than 2m households in need of a new supplier. The fate of a further 1.7m Bulb Energy accounts is yet to be decided by a special administrator, which was appointed to handle the large-scale collapse. Gillian Cooper, the head of energy for Citizens Advice, said: “As well as causing considerable disruption and confusion for customers, today’s announcement will add to the £2.6bn bill consumers are already facing due to these failures.” “The government must spread the cost of supplier failures so people aren’t left to foot a sky-high bill for chaos in the energy market, just as prices rise. It should also provide a one-off payment to people through the benefits system this April for those who need the most support,” Cooper added. The latest collapse will pile pressure on government officials to agree a package of measures to tackle the impact of rising energy costs on households, small businesses, manufacturers and the wider economy. Ofgem said it was “working closely with government and industry to make sure customers continue to be protected this winter”.",News/Business,Bristol Energy owner is latest UK supplier to go bust,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/bristol-energy-owner-is-latest-uk-supplier-to-go-bust
1/19/2022,"The wonderful world of football hadn’t held a big pointless awards ceremony for 49 days. That’s seven long weeks since the stilted vacuity of the Ballon d’Or, and the best part of two months without any of us having to go along with the patently absurd premise that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are the same players they were in 2011. The sweet gaslight-free relief couldn’t last, though, and last night Fifa staged their The Best awards, the most prestigious of all the football awards that also sound like a premium ready meal. Can you taste the difference?  No, not really. Alexia Putellas won the women’s prize, while Robert Lewandowski scooped the men’s version, just as they both did at the tail end of November in that other one. The latter proved to be something of an awkward outcome, as Ronaldo was also in attendance at the Zurich ceremony, but didn’t even make the shortlist.

Number one in a field of one. The Finest. Ronaldo described his bulbous silver consolation prize as “bling bling”, an aesthetic judgment that can be viewed either through the prism of his rather fetching bebop turtleneck sweater, or the double-breasted jacket that Jacob Rees-Mogg might think twice about wearing at the dispatch box, but not both. He also took the opportunity to announce his hope to play for “four or five years”, though the 36-year-old stroller at least had the good grace not to append “at the top level” to the statement, which would have further raised questions/encouraged cheap jokes about his immediate Old Trafford future, while pushing the concept of chutzpah to its very limit.

1/19/2022,"Biden came to office aiming to focus his foreign policy on the needs of the US middle class. Ending the pandemic, rejuvenating the nation, addressing climate change and competing with China were top priorities. Russia was not. After an initial series of measures designed to punish President Putin for his chemical-weapons attack on Aleksei Navalny, cyber espionage, and meddling in US domestic politics, policymakers opted to pursue stability and predictability in the US-Russia relationship. The crisis over Ukraine now threatens to derail this aim and distract from Biden’s broader agenda. It would be tragic if, after having been through the painful process of withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden Administration is now pulled deeper into the crisis over Ukraine.  But the risks are growing by the day. Biden has so far taken a balanced approach that combines active diplomacy with a threat of sanctions and support to Ukraine if Russia invades. A formidable cast of hawkish critics – from DC think tanks and Washington Post columnists to former members of the National Security Council and national intelligence directors – however, find this approach too soft and are charging the President with appeasement. They want the United States to get more involved, including militarily, in hope of deterring a Russian invasion. The very limited results of last week’s talks, combined with the cyber attack on the Ukrainian government websites and news of possible Russian preparations for a false flag operation in Ukraine all intensify the pressure. Frustration and anger in the face of Putin’s frank disregard for human life is natural and healthy. A war in Ukraine would also erode international law and norms that favor the peaceful resolution of conflicts, with negative repercussions for the United States. But it’s wrong to make the Ukraine crisis into a totemic issue for the whole international order. With tensions already so high, accelerating the deployment of anti-aircraft, anti-armor, or other weapons to Ukraine has more of a chance of hastening Putin’s march toward war then slowing him down. For such deployments to be effective, they would probably need to be accompanied by US military advisors, greatly increasing the risk of direct US-Russia conflict. Ukraine deserves western support, but we shouldn’t forget that isn’t a Nato member. Instead of trying to deter Putin with military measures, the United States should make every effort to keep last week’s diplomacy going. The current negotiating agenda focuses on a follow-on to the moribund Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces and resurrection of elements of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. While desirable, these alone are almost certainly not enough to keep Russia in the talks. In truth, it’s hard to say what will, but every diplomatic option needs to be on the table to forestall a Russian invasion. Russia’s insistence that Nato formally close its door to all future enlargement is unrealistic, but so are any hopes that Ukraine might someday join the alliance. Staunch resistance of several allies and Ukraine’s internal obstacles to meeting the requirements make this undeniable. Biden should be ready to signal to Putin that he is willing to explore creative solutions that would acknowledge these realities. It would be an extraordinary irony if Ukraine were to lose its independence as a state over the unfillable principle that it has the right to join an alliance that does not really want it. Any inkling of diplomatic accommodation of Russian demands of course risks bringing a firestorm of domestic and foreign criticism down on the President. High-level diplomacy with the Russian autocrat is especially hard given the way the Democrats attacked Putin for his embrace of Putin, a man Biden once called “a killer”. Then there is the risk that Putin rebuffs the offer publicly and invades anyway, leaving the Administration hanging in the wind and seemingly lending weight to the charges of appeasement. But if diplomacy fails, Russia will soon invade and everyone will lose except perhaps Presidents Putin and Xi. Faced with an invasion, Biden would have no alternative but to act on his threats, sanctioning Russia, and providing assistance to Ukraine. Over time, Nato nations would be forced to spend more on defense, including for land-based military capabilities with little relevance to strategic competition with China. China and Russia would draw closer together, accelerating a troubling trend toward the hardening of geopolitical fault lines, circumstances that recall the runup to World War I, and which Biden has expressly said he wants to avoid. None of this would be helpful to Biden’s aim of serving the needs of the American middle class.

1/19/2022,"Stephen Colbert observed the federal holiday for Martin Luther King on Monday evening, “a day in which we all celebrate Dr King’s legacy by taking his words out of context to make it look like he agrees with whatever we’re saying”.  The US Senate marked King’s birthday, the Late Show host continued, by “doing what they do best: nothing”. Hopes for a voting rights protection bill were dashed on Monday by the Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, who opposed lifting the filibuster that would allow Democrats to pass the measure without Republican support. “What is the legislative filibuster other than a tool that requires new federal policy to be broadly supported by senators representing a broader cross-section of Americans?” she said on the Senate floor. “No. No. Not representing a broader cross-section of Americans? The 50 senators who are currently filibustering the voting rights bill represent 41 million fewer Americans than the senators who support it,” Colbert protested. “Stop acting like the filibuster is anything other than an anti-democratic tool – which is also a pretty good description of Kyrsten Sinema.” To illustrate the point more eloquently, Colbert summoned an actually full quote by King from 5 July 1963: “I think the tragedy is we have a Congress with a Senate that has a minority of misguided senators who would use the filibuster to keep the majority of people from even voting. They won’t let the majority of senators vote, and certainly they wouldn’t want the majority of people to vote because they know they do not represent the majority of American people. In fact, they represent in their own states a very small minority.” “The sad thing is Dr King could make the exact same statement today, and it would be just as relevant,” Colbert noted, “as long as he mentioned Wordle.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers also mocked Republican figures for bending King’s words to their own ends, such as Florida senator Marco Rubio, who tweeted a conveniently partial quote: “When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.” “Did you read any further than that?” Meyers fumed, “or did you just pull up the text of the speech and do a control-F for ‘things that make it sound like he agrees with me’? Because dude, you gotta read just two more lines” to see that the rest of the quote condemns American racism and notes the country “has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned”. “Man, it’s times like these where you just wish Rubio would go back to his old job as the picture that comes with the frame,” Meyers joked. “I know they’re liars and con artists, but Dr King was essentially saying ‘you made a promise, and you didn’t keep it,’ and Rubio just quoted the ‘you made a promise’ part. “That would be like quoting Since U Been Gone, but not the chorus,” he added, mocking Rubio: “As Kelly Clarkson said, ‘and all you’d ever hear me say, is how I picture me with you. That’s all you’d ever hear me say’ – moving words about a love that lasted forever.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel checked in on the former president, who held a conspiracy-fueled rally over the weekend in Florence, Arizona. “Fatty LaBelle himself took the stage to scream about being cheated out of the election and to lash out at all the networks who refuse to go along with that,” Kimmel summarized. More specifically, Trump called coverage of his big lie of election fraud “a lot of bullshit, that’s what it is”. “Yeah, that’s what it is,” Kimmel laughed. “Somehow he went from bigly to big lie.” Trump also offered a Covid conspiracy theory Kimmel called “outlandish even by Trump standards”: that Democrats are “denigrating white people” in Covid treatments to “determine who lives and who dies … it’s unbelievable to think this.” “Yeah, it is. It’s super unbelievable to think this,” Kimmel retorted. Trump also claimed that when it comes to Covid treatments, white people are “being sent to the back of the line.” “Where does he even get this stuff?” Kimmel marveled. “This is a man who hasn’t waited in a line since like hot lunch in the fourth grade. White people are being sent to the back of the line? I guess Martin Luther King’s dream has been realized at last.”",Arts/Culture,Colbert to Congress: ‘Stop acting like the filibuster is anything other than an anti-democratic tool’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/18/stephen-colbert-filibuster-late-night-tv
1/19/2022,"More than two-thirds of the common side-effects people experience after a Covid jab can be attributed to a negative version of the placebo effect rather than the vaccine itself, researchers claim. Scientists in the US examined data from 12 clinical trials of Covid vaccines and found that the “nocebo effect” accounted for about 76% of all common adverse reactions after the first dose and nearly 52% after the second dose.  The findings suggest that a substantial proportion of milder side-effects, such as headaches, short-term fatigue, and arm pain are not produced by the constituents of the vaccine, but by other factors thought to generate the nocebo response, including anxiety, expectation and misattributing various ailments to having had the jab. In view of their results, the researchers argue that better public information about nocebo responses may improve Covid vaccine uptake by reducing the concerns that make some people hesitant. “Telling patients that the intervention they are taking has side-effects that are similar to placebo treatments for the condition in randomised controlled trials actually reduces anxiety and makes patients take a moment to consider the side-effect,” said Ted Kaptchuk, professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard medical school, and a senior author on the study. “But we need more research.” Kaptchuck and Dr Julia Haas at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston analysed adverse events reported during a dozen clinical trials of Covid vaccines. In each trial, those in the placebo arm were given injections of inactive salt solution instead of vaccine. The study did not look at severe, rare side-effects such as blood clots or heart inflammation. Writing in the journal Jama Network Open, the researchers describe how after the first injection more than 35% of those in the placebo groups experienced so-called “systemic” side-effects, such as headache and fatigue, with 16% reporting site-specific ailments including arm pain or redness or swelling at the injection site. As expected, those who received a first shot of vaccine were more likely to experience side-effects. About 46% reported systemic symptoms and two-thirds experienced arm pain or other localised symptoms at the injection site. When the researchers looked at side-effects after the second jab, they found the rate of headaches or other systemic symptoms was nearly twice as high in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group, at 61% and 32% respectively. The difference was even greater for local ailments, reaching 73% among those who had the vaccine and 12% in the placebo group. Overall, the researchers calculate that about two-thirds of common side-effects reported in Covid vaccine trials are driven by the nocebo effect, in particular headaches and fatigue, which many Covid vaccine leaflets list as the most common adverse reactions after a shot. While evidence suggests that information about side-effects can cause people to misattribute common ailments to the vaccine, or make people hyper-alert to how they are feeling, Kaptchuk argues for more information about side-effects, not less. “Most researchers argue that patients should be told less about side-effects to reduce their anxiety,” he said. “I think this is wrong. Honesty is the way to go.”",News/Science,"‘Nocebo effect’: two-thirds of Covid jab reactions not caused by vaccine, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/18/nocebo-effect-two-thirds-of-covid-jab-reactions-not-caused-by-vaccine-study-suggests
1/19/2022,"Abargain-bin version of Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, this Kickstarter-funded feature debut by Scott Conditt and Jeremy Tremp has a similar video game veneration and chirpy tone. But their sci-fi/fantasy action-comedy engages more frontally with gaming culture, specifically the intersection between ye olde pixellated times and the all-streaming, all-dancing, eternally online new generation. Max Jenkins (Tom Plumley) is a cocky online gaming hotshot who, when not rampaging around in barbarian avatar guise, works as a clerk at local emporium Fallout Games, along with fellow virtual squadmates Liz (Hassie Harrison) and Reggie (Joey Morgan). Left alone on the evening shift, he is flabbergasted when a mysterious stranger leaves a package on the counter containing a cartridge of Nether Dungeon, a legendary 80s title lost to history due to a beef between its two creators. He uploads the game for the internet faithful – unaware that its source code contains an incantation from an ancient sect with designs on enthralling (in both senses) mankind.  Max Reload and the Nether Blasters clings to the lightweight adventure-romp template to perfectly amiable effect. Max and pals flee possessed, red-eyed evil ex-boyfriends and run around town trying to locate the bad-boy designer (Greg Grunberg) and estranged business partner (Joseph D Reitman) who hold the key to defeating these malign gamemasters. Plumley leads from the front with fresh-faced YouTuber zeal and the film’s energy bar never flags, even if the geek-world humour is sometimes clunky and forced. Conditt and Tremp root their plot in the contrast between the lone-wolf bedroom-coder ethos and the hyper-garrulous internet co-op play era. But the former now has touchstone status for the latter, as the directors’ fetish for 16-bit aesthetics make apparent: we get pixellated inserts of Max BMXing around town and fantasy-cover-art-apeing colour bursts. While its nostalgic bent means it doesn’t dare modify the 1980s film template either, it also means it has a true aficionado’s attention to detail regarding gamer lore – cheerled by a bellowing cameo from the high priest of geek, Kevin Smith, as Fallout Games’ VR-obsessed owner.

1/19/2022,"One’s enjoyment of How I Met Your Father, Hulu’s 10-episode standalone sequel of the popular sitcom How I Met Your Mother, will mostly depend on nostalgia for the original. I don’t have much of it for How I Met Your Mother (often styled HIMYM), a successor to Friends about a group of white twentysomethings, then thirtysomethings, living and dating in Manhattan which ran on CBS from 2005 until 2014. Everyone has their taste in TV comfort food (I just inhaled Emily in Paris) but HIMYM and its hopeless romanticism was too corny for me, too sweet. Its central conceit of a middle-aged Ted Mosby (the late Bob Saget) telling his children the story of meeting their mother in the most convoluted way possible may have started out fresh but felt overdone, even for a multi-camera network sitcom with a laugh track, by the early 2010s.  This sequel, starring Hilary Duff as the central hopeless romantic, freshens up the cast’s diversity and the timeline – Duff’s Sophie is bumbling through 2022 – but barely warms over anything else, laugh track included. The pitched, jovial performances and homey sets recall the original (there are other, more overt connections, which Hulu has requested not to spoil), and so, unfortunately, do the anodyne punchlines, maybe two of which land an episode. The four 25-minute episodes made available for review sprinkle in the likes of Tinder, Uber and the ghosts of viral videos past, but it’s a mechanical, stale simulacrum of friend hangs and dating in 2022, a relic of a bygone era that enters the sitcom uncanny valley. There’s not much reason to continue through unless the beats recalled some past time of curling up with the TV. The pilot of HIMYF, written by creators Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger and directed by Pamela Fryman (who directed all but 12 episodes of the original), opens, like HIMYM, in the future. In 2050, the older Sophie, played with vigor by Kim Cattrall, regales her son (a disembodied voice on the phone) with the story of how she met his father in 2020s New York (with help from uncooperative digital assistant and wine). Back in 2022, Sophie is a 29-year-old photographer living in Queens with her fashionable, libidinous roommate Valentina (Francia Raisa) and Valentina’s brand-new hunk boyfriend Charlie (Tom Ainsley), a posh and cartoonishly naive Englishman she convinced to hop the pond on a whim. (Sophie turns 30 in the fourth episode with a party she hastily classes up to impress a suitor played by Josh Peck, a familiar face to the Buzzfeed Where Are They Now?-era millennials this show appears to target.) Sophie is singularly focused on finding her future husband and singularly unlucky at doing so, having struck out on 87 straight Tinder dates. While Ubering to a first date with promising suitor Ian (Daniel Augustin), Sophie – exasperated and starry-eyed, convinced she’s found the right guy after two weeks of Tinder messaging – hits it off with handsome driver Jesse (Chris Lowell), the Robin to Sophie’s Ted. And as with the original, HIMYF contains both a marriage proposal – Jesse’s best friend Sid (Life of Pi’s Suraj Sharma), a bar owner, to his long-distance girlfriend Hannah (Ashley Reyes) – and a grand romantic gesture. The episode ends with the mishmash friend group walking the Brooklyn Bridge, something Sophie swore she’d only do once she met “the one” but has revised based on whimsy. For those unfamiliar to the rhythms of HIMYM – and, again, I don’t know why you’d become invested in this otherwise – thus begins a soft-boiled knot of entanglements. Jesse and Sophie become will-they-won’t-they friends; Valentina and Charlie fight and make up (the two enjoy sex in enclosed spaces, a running gag); Valentina and Sid flirt; Charlie befriends Jesse’s adopted sister Ellen (Tien Tran), a recent arrival from Iowa, divorced, and the only queer member of the core group (at least so far). All work to upgrade Jesse’s dating life in the aftermath of a rejected marriage proposal that goes viral. I’m inclined to root for Hilary Duff as an OG Lizzie McGuire fan, but as endearing as she can be, there’s only so much an actor can do with a character whose personality basically boils down to finding the one; the show mostly served to remind me how disappointing it is that Disney kneecapped to the point of cancellation a planned reboot of Lizzie as a thirty-cusp woman dating in New York. Still, what charm this sequel does have it largely owes to Duff – doe eyes, open face, innocent – grounding the shallow Sophie as much as she can, and Lowell, as the warm-eyed, protective Jesse; their sparks provide the show’s little heat. That might be enough to warm viewers to a couple of episodes, but unlikely to convince those neutral to HIMYM’s flavor to buy in. When the appreciation depends on memories and old routines, past phases, why bother? There’s a lot of light and snacky fare out there, but HIMYF feels more akin to a reheated, juiced-up leftover.

1/19/2022,"The government has unveiled plans to crack down on misleading cryptocurrency ads by making them subject to the same regulations as marketing for other financial products such as shares and insurance. The Treasury has responded to rising concern over a surge in ads promoting cryptoassets, which are unregulated in the UK, and the potential for naive investors to lose money given the highly volatile price swings of digital currencies such as bitcoin.  The move to change the law will see ads for cryptoassets become subject to rules governed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to bring them “in line with the same high standard that other financial promotions such as stocks, shares and insurance products are held to”. The Treasury said the aim was to strike a balance between allowing the booming cryptoasset market to flourish while protecting consumers by making sure ads encouraging investment were “fair, clear and not misleading”. “Cryptopoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest,” said Rishi Sunak, the UK chancellor. “But it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims. We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.” There has been a boom in cryptocurrency advertising encouraging consumers not to miss out on the craze, with about 2.3 million people in the UK now thought to own a cryptoasset. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a number of campaigns for being irresponsible, and last month criticised leading players in the sector while declaring the issue of misleading crypto marketing a “red alert” priority. Adding the regulatory oversight of the FCA will mean that companies that break rules can be fined and their ads must pass muster before they launch. This is not the case with the ASA, which only steps in once it receives complaints after a campaign is in the public domain. Last year the FCA warned that more people were chasing high returns and said it was concerned that any new investors were increasingly putting their money into high risk investments which may not be right for them. “The government’s decision to bring these types of advertisements into the scope of regulation will mitigate the risks of consumer harm, ensuring people have the appropriate information to make informed investment decisions,” said the Treasury. Last week the Guardian reported that cryptocurrency ads hit record levels on the London public transport network last year, renewing calls for a ban to protect consumers from being drawn into making risky investments.",News/Technology,Treasury plans crackdown on ‘misleading’ cryptocurrency ads,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/18/treasury-plans-crackdown-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-ads
1/19/2022,"On the first day of 2022 – the hottest New Year’s Day on record – Priti Patel announced that cracking down on eco protesters would be one of her priorities for the year. It wasn’t simply rhetoric. The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill for England and Wales being debated in parliament provides the police with a dramatic extension to their powers to stop or constrain protest. It even contains a provision allowing police to fine protesters for inadvertent breaches of restrictions they “ought” to have known about.  It’s remarkable that the government would frame people campaigning about the climate crisis, rather than the climate crisis itself, as the priority problem. But Patel is following a line of thought going back to the dawn of industrialisation, which sees protest crowds as a source of fear. Assembling into crowds gives people power, and allows them to challenge forms of social control. For those accustomed to holding the whip hand, there is nothing more terrifying than that. These fears and fantasies about the crowd were systematised into theories that hold crowd members to be inherently violent, and thus view any crowd event as having the potential to descend into mayhem. This then legitimated repression. One can’t reason with the mob, only dominate them. The irony is that the repressive power of the police, supposedly the means of stopping violence, is actually the source of most violence in crowd events – either directly (the police inflict far more violence than is inflicted upon them) or indirectly (the repression of protesters’ rights inflames previously peaceable crowds). In recent years these dynamics of repression and escalation have been increasingly recognised not just by critics but by the police themselves. In the UK, the turning point was the death of Ian Tomlinson during the 2009 G20 summit protests. This led to a major report, Adapting to Protest, which suggested new forms of public order policing, based on new policing practices. One is facilitation, which entails changing the focus from stopping the crowd, to helping them achieve lawful goals. Another is dialogue policing, where police liaison officers act as mediators between police and the crowd. Recently there has also been emphasis on rights-based policing, which is organised around upholding the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as enshrined in article 11 of the European convention on human rights and article 21 of the international covenant on civil and political rights. The recent Cop26 in Glasgow was heralded by Police Scotland as an event where the principles of rights-based policing would be put into practice. Our team of psychologists, sociologists and legal scholars spent two weeks on the streets of the city examining how that worked out. Certainly there was a lot of protest – a 100,000-strong march was the centrepiece, but marches, vigils, sit-downs and lock-ons occurred every day. And yet there was virtually no violence, and fewer than 100 arrests in total. Much of this has been put down to “firm but amiable policing”. But protesters had no intention to be violent in the first place, even Priti Patel’s bugbears in Extinction Rebellion (XR). This was exemplified for me personally when XR mounted an action outside a Santander bank branch. Two people locked themselves together and blocked the street. Protesters assembled, chanted, danced and painted graffiti on the walls of the bank. Two hours later it was all over, everyone had left and council cleaners had even removed the graffiti. “Was it hard work?” I asked the cleaners. “No,” they replied. “Easy, it was chalk-based paint [designed to wipe off with a cloth].” XR protesters may be awkward and they may be disruptive. But they are certainly not violent or destructive. The only times we saw mounting tension and anger were where protesters did experience the policing as excessive and intrusive – as when police gathered in large numbers, and used surveillance officers to film protesters – or repressive, notably during two kettling incidents. This came down to differences in the sense of threat or danger. While the police committed in principle to enabling peaceful protest, disruptive crowd actions were always seen to compromise official control and hence create danger, and therefore had to be policed robustly. For protesters, however, danger was not on the horizon and hence the policing was seen as excessive. For example, the kettling incident on 3 November occurred when a protester outside the offices of the SSE energy company was said by police to have sprayed two officers with paint. The police characterised this as an assault on their officers and as evidence of the threat posed by the crowd. Protesters saw it as nothing of the sort, and certainly not a reason to treat their protests as threatening. Overall, Cop26 represented an uneasy grafting of rights-based policing concerns on to prior concerns about control. While the low level of arrests seems encouraging, if it comes out of an overall massive use of force that makes protesters feel unable to exercise their rights to peaceful protest it’s hardly something to celebrate. The way forward is to understand that a rights-based approach cannot simply be mixed into an existing public order framework but must lead to a rethinking of traditional policing priorities. Which is why the police and crime bill is a step backwards. It delegitimates protest in the eyes of the police, and delegitimates police in the eyes of protesters. It ditches individual rights, and raises restoring control as the overriding consideration. The bill unambiguously reinstates the police as arbiters rather than facilitators of dissent. It will further erode police legitimacy and give succour to a chant we heard repeatedly on the streets of Glasgow: “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?” Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science. He is a professor of Psychology at the University of St Andrews.

1/19/2022,"The US supreme court will on Tuesday consider whether the city of Boston violated the free speech of a Christian group who sought to fly a flag in front of city hall. Three flagpoles stand outside Boston city hall. The US flag and the Massachusetts state flag are permanent fixtures. The third pole is usually reserved for the Boston flag but the city has allowed groups to temporarily use it while holding events in front of the building.  Flags that have been flown include the LGBTQ+ pride flag and those of different nations. In 2017, Harold Shurtleff, the founder of Camp Constitution, a volunteer group that aims “to enhance the understanding of the country’s Judeo-Christian heritage”, applied to have a white flag with a red cross on a blue square flown during an event featuring “short speeches by some local clergy focusing on Boston’s history”, court documents say. The city denied the application and shortly afterwards published rules saying it would deny flags that support “discrimination, prejudice or religious movements”. Shurtleff sued, saying the city violated his free speech by denying him and Camp Constitution access to the flagpole, which he argues is a public forum. The city argued that the flagpole is government speech and that to fly religious flags from it would constitute an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. In court documents, lawyers for Shurtleff argue that the city long exercised little control over who could use the flagpole, sometimes approving applications without looking at the flags that would be raised. Before Shurtleff’s application, over a decade, the city approved 284 flag-raising events without denying any. Two lower courts have decided in favor of the city, but the decisions could be overturned by a supreme court controlled 6-3 by conservative justices. Furthermore, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Biden justice department have filed briefs siding with Camp Constitution, saying the flagpole has been used essentially as a public forum. “[The city] has flown political flags, national flags and the flags of private civic organizations,” wrote David Cole, national legal director of the ACLU, in an op-ed for the Washington Post. “Free speech principles prohibit the government from discriminating against speakers because of their messages, including religious messages.” Once the supreme court announced it would be taking up the case, Boston said it would no longer accept applications to fly flags in front of city hall.",News/Law,US supreme court to consider Boston’s refusal to fly Christian flag at city hall,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/18/boston-chriistian-group-flag-city-hall-supreme-court
1/19/2022,"Mexico’s embattled press corps has suffered a shattering start to the new year with the murders of two journalists who had dared chronicle their country’s slide into drug and corruption-fuelled violence. Margarito Martínez Esquivel, a crime reporter and photographer who often collaborated with members of the foreign media, was shot dead outside his home in the northern city of Tijuana on Monday lunchtime.  “Unfortunately, I couldn’t do anything for him,” his distraught wife, Elena Martínez, told the San Diego Union-Tribune – one of numerous international outlets the journalist had worked with, including the BBC, the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post. Martínez’s death came a week after another journalist, José Luis Gamboa, was fatally stabbed in the eastern state of Veracruz, another of Mexico’s most violent regions. Two days earlier Gamboa, the director of a news website called Inforegio, used Twitter to call for the appointment of an anti-drug tsar who might slow the decades-long escalation in bloodshed. Last year he lamented how parts of the government, instead of fighting drug trafficking, had been sucked into “a great criminal association” with the cartels. “The Mexican population still hasn’t grasped how serious this is,” Gamboa tweeted. The two as yet unexplained killings – which follow the murder of nine journalists last year – sparked outrage and mourning in the Latin American country, which is considered the world’s most dangerous country for reporters outside war zones. In some regions journalists have become so fearful of being abducted and killed that they take DIY dental impressions and leave them in the freezer at home before going out to report so relatives can identify their remains. “It’s shocking to have this happen so early in the year and to have one murder happen so shortly after the other,” said Jan-Albert Hootsen, the Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. The Tijuana-based press collective Yo Sí Soy Periodista (Yes, I’m a journalist) demanded a swift investigation into the killing of Martínez, who spent more than two decades documenting the border city’s security crisis and worked for the weekly newspaper Zeta. The group said Martínez was the 29th Mexican journalist to be killed since Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, took power in December 2018 promising to pacify the country. Wendy Fry, who reports on Tijuana for the San Diego Union-Tribune and knew Martínez, remembered an industrious and kind colleague who was almost always the first to arrive on the scene on of a story. “It’s a risky thing to be a journalist in TJ and he just had a lot of pride in doing it … He worked tirelessly: day, night, afternoon,” said Fry, one of the shell-shocked journalists who gathered outside the photographer’s house on Monday. As news of Martínez’s killing spread, the Facebook page where he would livestream murder scenes to tens of thousands of followers was flooded with messages from workmates and politicians. “I feel heartbroken. I can’t believe Margarito Martínez is gone … they murdered him in cold blood,” wrote one friend, Gabriela Diaz. Another journalist friend, Manuel Ayala, tweeted: “The name of Margarito Martínez has this afternoon been typed out in every Tijuana newsroom with tears and with blood. We will never forget because on this day they shot every single member of our community through the chest.” Michael Robinson Chávez, a Pulitzer-winning photographer for the Washington Post, called him “a true professional, brave and tenacious. “He will be missed,” Chávez tweeted. Hootsen said the seemingly never-ending wave of journalist killings was driven by government inaction and impunity. “What it boils down to is that in Mexico if you want to hurt a reporter you can do it and there is a very small chance you will be caught – and an even smaller chance you will be sentenced to jail time,” he said. “The Mexican government kind of makes it easy for people who want to hurt reporters.”",News/World news,Two journalists exposing Mexico’s corruption and drug violence murdered within one week,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/journalists-exposing-mexico-corruption-drug-violence-murdered
1/19/2022,"An initiative in Brighton aimed at helping protect the bee population could do more harm than good, scientists have warned. The council in Brighton has passed a planning condition that means any new building more than five metres high will have to include swift boxes and special bricks with holes known as bee bricks. They will provide nesting and hibernating space for solitary bees.  However, scientists have warned that such a move will not make any real difference for biodiversity, with some arguing that it could make matters worse for bees if the holes are not cleaned properly and attract mites or encourage the spread of disease. The idea was first raised in 2019 by councillor Robert Nemeth, and the condition was attached to all planning permissions after 1 April 2020. Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, said he had tried a bee brick out and that the holes were not deep enough to be “ideal homes for bees” but “are probably better than nothing”. He added: “Bee bricks seem like a displacement activity to me. We are kidding ourselves if we think having one of these in every house is going to make any real difference for biodiversity. Far more substantial action is needed, and these bricks could easily be used as ‘greenwash’ by developers.” Sebastian Worms, a graduate student from the University of Louvain in Belgium, said that the bricks were more educational tools for children and could have a negative impact if they were too big and not cleaned enough. “To help bees it would be better to introduce more flowers,” he said. Adam Hart, an entomologist and professor of science communication at the university of Gloucestershire, said that sometimes “well-meaning interventions can have unwanted consequences”. “It would be good to have much more research on all of these ‘bee hotels’ so bees can get the maximum benefit from people’s desire to help them,” he said. Not everyone was in agreement that the bricks were a bad idea. Francis Gilbert, a professor of ecology at the University of Nottingham, said that bee bricks did not need to be cleaned. “The mites will leave after one to two seasons and then the bees will recolonise,” he said. “There will be beneficial microbes in the holes as well, so they should not be cleaned. So bee bricks are an unequivocal good thing.” Lars Chittka, a professor in sensory and behavioural ecology at Queen Mary University, said that bees “naturally possess hygienic behaviour that would allow them to mitigate the risks at least to some extent, or that they would assess the holes’ states before using them, which should to some extent counterbalance the risks that come with such long-term nesting opportunities.” He added: “It might well be that the Brighton project provides an opportunity to study the risks and benefits on a reasonably wide scale, and over an extended period – say five years. But I would certainly recommend not copying this project across the country before the long-term benefits and risks are explored.” Nemeth, who is also a beekeeper, said: “There’s a well-known saying in the beekeeping world that if you ask 100 different beekeepers a question then you get 101 different answers. “It’s going to take some years yet to establish the degree of effectiveness of bee bricks but it’s heartening to know that studies are under way. What is definite though is that carrying on with the status quo of ignoring nature in many new-build properties is a biodiversity disaster of the highest order.” There are about 270 species of bee in Britain, just under 250 of which are solitary bees that live alone, although often nest close to one another. Solitary bees in Britain are highly diverse, and so are their nesting habits. Most British species nest in the ground, excavating their own nest. The honeybee is probably the best-known bee. They live socially and are led by a queen and serviced by male drones and female worker bees. The bee population is thought to have declined in the UK since the 1970s. For example, the number of managed honeybee hives in England dropped by 50% between 1985 and 2005, and 67% of common widespread moth species have declined since the 1970s. Since 1900, the UK has lost 13 species of bee, and a further 35 are considered under threat of extinction. The decline in population is thought to be because of changes in land use, which has led to habitat loss. Other issues affecting bees include disease, pesticides, pollution and climate change. One of the best ways of helping bees is thought to be by planting flowers rich in nectar.",News/Environment,"Brighton bee bricks initiative may do more harm than good, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/brighton-bee-bricks-initiative-may-do-more-harm-than-good-say-scientists
