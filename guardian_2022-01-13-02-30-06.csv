1/13/2022,"Not since Ronald Reagan was president and Paul Volcker was the hardline chairman of the Federal Reserve has US inflation been as high as 7%, so inevitably the latest jump in the country’s cost of living index will have consequences. The US central bank has historically tended to fear deep recession more than runaway inflation, scarred as it still is by the legacy of the Great Depression. The Fed, however, cannot ignore the risks of a wage-price spiral developing and will be forced to act.  In part, that’s because of what’s been happening to core inflation, a measure that strips out volatile elements of the consumer prices index such as fuel and food. This rose sharply in December to an annual rate of 5.5%, making it harder for the Fed to argue inflationary pressures will be fleeting. The price of used cars, clothes and air fares all registered hefty increases. Increases in interest rates are inevitable as a result. Wall Street expects the Fed to start pushing borrowing costs up in March, with four quarter-point jumps this year and a further four in 2023, taking them to just over 2%. This is a long way short of the shock treatment administered by Volcker – official borrowing costs peaked at 20% in 1981 – but it will still be enough to slow the US economy and make life harder for the Democrats in November’s mid-term elections. The Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, knows there is a risk that an over-aggressive approach to inflation could send Wall Street into a tailspin. He is also aware that many emerging and developing economies, especially those that have borrowed heavily in dollars, are vulnerable to higher US rates. In the words of the Roman emperor Augustus, he would be advised to make haste slowly. Other central banks face the same dilemma as the Fed, under pressure to tackle the rising cost of living but worried about moving too fast. UK inflation will hit 6% in the coming months and the financial markets expect the Bank of England – which has already raised interest rates once – to push up borrowing costs to somewhere close to 1% by the end of the year. Pressure will mount on the European Central Bank to act too.

1/13/2022,"The Scottish Tory leader has called for Boris Johnson to resign, after the prime minister apologised for attending a lockdown-busting party in Downing Street, claiming he believed it was a “work event”. Many Conservative MPs said they remained unsatisfied by Johnson’s carefully worded explanation, delivered at the start of Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions.  But Douglas Ross, who spoke to Johnson on Wednesday, is the first senior Tory figure to call publicly for the prime minister’s immediate departure. “Regretfully I have to say that his position is no longer tenable,” he told reporters. He had demanded an explanation from the prime minister after an email emerged on Monday from the prime minister’s principal private secretary, inviting colleagues to “socially distanced drinks” on 20 May 2020, during the first Covid lockdown. Ross said: “What we also heard from the prime minister today was an apology. And he said, with hindsight, he would have done things differently, which for me, is an acceptance from the prime minister that it was wrong, and therefore, I don’t want to be in this position, but I am in the position now where I don’t think he can continue as he leader of the Conservatives. “The evidence is clear. People were invited to bring their own booze, to enjoy the garden in Downing Street and that is by any definition a party, a gathering that wasn’t allowed and therefore the prime minister broke his own rules.” Ross said it is up to the prime minister how quickly he stood down and it was up to other MPs whether they pressed for a motion of no confidence in him. “That’s up to individual MPs what they do but I think we have seen across the house some pretty quite galling stories of how people were affected either themselves or their constituents, and I think there’s a strength of feeling across the spectrum that this is a most serious issue. “My position as an individual is that I don’t think his position as leader of the Conservatives and prime minister is tenable in the future.” Other Tory backbenchers said Johnson’s account of the event on 20 May had bought him the right to wait for an investigation by civil servant Sue Gray, which could report as soon as next week. Dan Poulter said he was “pleased,” Johnson had apologised, but it was “not much consolation to those of us who cared for patients on the frontline of the NHS and saw them die of Covid”. He said the inquiry should be conducted “very quickly” and “should the PM be found to have actively mislead parliament or if he faces criminal sanction (or both) then his position would be untenable”. The former health minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC he welcomed the fact Johnson had shown “some transparency”, in admitting mistakes had been made. But he questioned Johnson’s explanation that he “believed implicitly” the booze-fuelled gathering he dropped into was a “work event”. “It clearly was not a work event and that is the problem. and I think it is pretty surprising the prime minister wasn’t briefed to that effect,” Hammond said. He added that his constituents would still feel “let down” having heard “a bit of an apology” from the PM. Julian Sturdy, the Conservative MP for York Outer, said Johnson’s claim he thought the gathering was work-related “will not wash with the British public, who at the relevant time were making significant sacrifices”, adding in a statement to the Yorkshire Post that he shares the “frustration and disappointment of the many constituents”. In a brief statement as prime minister’s questions kicked off, Johnson said that he joined the 20 May event for about 25 minutes from around 6pm, saying that, with the No 10 garden being used as “an extension of the office” amid lockdown, he believed it was a work event. “With hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside,” he said, arguing that the event “could be said, technically, to fall within the guidance” of the time. Cabinet ministers appeared to be rallying round Johnson in public, with the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, tweeting that he was “right to personally apologise”, and that “the inquiry should now be allowed to its work and establish the full facts of what happened”. The prime minister has committed to returning to the House of Commons to make a statement when Gray has reported. His press secretary declined to say on Wednesday whether he would resign, if Gray finds he breached Covid guidance.",News/Politics,Scottish Tory leader calls for Boris Johnson to resign,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/scottish-tory-leader-calls-for-boris-johnson-to-resign
1/13/2022,"Downing Street’s May 2020 bring-your-own-booze party has reignited the despair about Boris Johnson’s leadership that the remaining Conservative optimists hoped might disappear over the winter break. Now, though, the blaze has revived with a vengeance. Johnson’s apology to the Commons does not solve this in any way. The apology merely confirms what was already clear: an astonishingly insensitive breach was committed at the height of the first lockdown. This dereliction did not just feature Johnson as a participant: it was marked by his very character. His apology, with its continued pretence about a work event within the regulations, lacks either moral worth or political credibility.  Conservative MPs are well aware their leader is a dodgy chancer. Some of them actively admire this. Others are happy to profit from it. Many loathe it while quietly despising themselves for permitting it. But the style works only while it succeeds. Most Tories had put Johnson on probation after his spectacularly disastrous December. The fresh explosion this week means they are now looking more urgently than before at the alternatives. Tory MPs find themselves on the threshold of a leadership change. Sue Gray’s report will be important in shaping the timing of the outcome, but her findings could be a lose-lose for Johnson either way. If Gray blames the prime minister, he will struggle not to be brought down directly. If she lets him off in some way, his authority will not suddenly be restored. Tory MPs hold all the cards. All of which explains why the party is moving towards its third leadership election in six years. The Johnson experiment seems to have almost run its course. It is a remarkable turn of events that Tory party members – demographically so deeply unrepresentative of modern Britain – should again be asked to choose the prime minister. Johnson was the first PM ever chosen in this way, and it has been a terrible precedent. Much should now written about the candidates already quietly vying for the leadership. There they were, in a row beside Johnson along the frontbench as he tried to eat humble pie at prime minister’s questions: Liz Truss, Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Sajid Javid and Michael Gove. All of them harbour hopes of climbing to the top of the greasy pole when Johnson falls, as fall he surely must now. Yet the key figure is the man who, rather conspicuously, wasn’t there at all: Rishi Sunak is the one to beat in this contest. Although he came just behind Truss in a recent ConservativeHome poll of party members, he was ahead of her in this week’s Sky/YouGov survey of members. Crucially, according to the Observer/Opinium poll over Christmas, he would do far better for the Tories in a general election than either Johnson or Truss. That finding will play massively in his favour among MPs. It needs saying that the ascent of Sunak would be remarkable. He would be the first person of Asian heritage, and the first person of colour, to become prime minister and to lead a major British political party. That would be another sign, if one were needed, of the immense capacity of the Tory party to adapt to social and cultural change. Other parties can only watch in frustrated envy. But there is much more to Sunak’s success, if it happens, than this. On my bookshelves stands a copy of the historian Robert Blake’s biography of the former Conservative leader Andrew Bonar Law. With neat historical symmetry, Bonar Law emerged to become Tory leader 100 years ago – the Tory backbench 1922 Committee owes its name to the machinations that overthrew David Lloyd George and took Bonar Law to Downing Street. But it is the title of Blake’s book that matters. It is called The Unknown Prime Minister. It is a title that will soon have to be used again. Sunak may not have risen without trace, but his ascent has been unusually rapid. He only entered the Commons in 2015, succeeding William Hague as MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire. He has only been a minister since 2018. He then raced up the ministerial ladder after being handpicked by Johnson (with some encouragement from Dominic Cummings) to succeed Javid as chancellor less than two years ago. Although Sunak has been chancellor during the greatest peacetime crisis of the modern era, he is extremely inexperienced. This is something that every Tory MP whom I contacted for this article remarked on. “The honest answer is that we really don’t know if he cuts it,” said one former cabinet minister. Others fear that Sunak, who is exceptionally wealthy, operates within his own bubble and is too close to Dominic Cummings, who is keen to destabilise Johnson. This is particularly important because Sunak’s popularity, which was very high when he was doling out public money to support the economy during the first phases of Covid, seems to be ebbing. The return of inflation, the imminence of the tax rises that he announced in the autumn budget and the expected big hike in energy charges from April are combining to make Sunak a less voter-friendly minister these days. For the most part, Sunak has gone along with Johnson’s willingness to spend. But the borrowing and taxation that have marked his chancellorship are not popular across the party. A significant minority of Tory MPs remain avid disciples of the small state, low taxation and privatisation of Margaret Thatcher’s era. Most of what Sunak has said since entering politics – to say nothing of his own wealth – suggests that he is broadly sympathetic to this approach too. We have probably all been in a position a bit like the one in which the Tory party finds itself. Something goes bang with your car. You get an estimate done at the garage, and the cost of the repairs seems eye-watering. Do you go ahead, throwing good money after bad? Or do you start thinking it would be better to get a more reliable new vehicle? The answer is not to be dazzled by the brochures, and to think before you buy. Johnson’s looming failure may be very much his own doing, but its consequences will be felt right across the Tory party and beyond. The electoral coalition that Johnson created in 2019 may not outlive his fall. Sunak and Truss, the apparent frontrunners to succeed, would struggle to maintain the kind of appeal that Johnson achieved. The Tory party should not deceive itself about Sunak. Electing him would be an act based on hope rather than experience. Given that this is what the party also did in choosing Johnson, it is something of which they should be particularly wary.

1/13/2022,"A Chinese woman has become an overnight sensation after she posted video diaries documenting her life after being stuck at a blind date’s house. Wang went for dinner on Sunday at her blind date’s residence in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, where a recent outbreak of Covid cases sent thousands into quarantine in parts of the city. As she was finishing her meal, the area was put under lockdown.  She was unable to leave her date’s house as result, she told the Shanghai-based news outlet the Paper this week, saying she had gone to the city for a week-long trip to meet potential suitors from the southern province of Guangdong. Wang quickly shared the bizarre experience with friends on social media. “I’m getting old now, my family introduced me to 10 matches … The fifth date wanted to show off his cooking skills and invited me over to his house for dinner,” said Wang in one of the videos. She also posted short videos documenting her daily life in lockdown on WeChat, which show her date cooking meals for her, doing household chores, and working on his laptop while she sleeps, according to clips published by local Chinese media. “Besides the fact he’s as mute as a wooden mannequin, everything else [about him] is pretty good,” Wang told the Paper on Tuesday. “Despite his food being mediocre, he’s still willing to cook, which I think is great.” Although Wang did not seem to complain about the experience, the prolonged lockdown has not caused romance to bloom. Wang’s experience is not unique. Last month a man found himself under lockdown while moving his luggage in Xi’an in the north-western Shaanxi province. He had to borrow a duvet from neighbours. What was unexpected for Wang, however, is that her video diaries became an online sensation on China’s social media platform, Weibo. A related hashtag has been viewed more than 5m times across China. But Wang’s fame also led to embarrassment for her date. She has now taken down some of the videos. “Friends have been calling him and I think this has definitely affected his life, so I have taken them down for now,” she said in a video posted on Tuesday. “Thanks everyone for your attention … I hope the outbreak ends soon and that my single sisters also find a relationship soon.” Additional reporting by Agence France-Presse",News/World news,Woman’s diary goes viral as lockdown in China forces her to stay with blind date,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/womans-diary-goes-viral-as-lockdown-in-china-forces-her-to-stay-with-blind-date
1/13/2022,"A police standoff with an armed man who has barricaded himself in his home with his eight-year-old son has entered its fourth day, forcing local businesses and a school to stay shut and locking down neighbouring households. A 41-year-old man, who police say has weapons, is refusing to leave his ground floor flat in Earlsdon, Coventry, where he has been holed up with his son since the early hours of Sunday.  Armed police are stationed outside the property as negotiators try to convince the man to leave safely. Speaking outside the police cordon on Wednesday afternoon, Supt Ronan Tyrer, of West Midlands police, said the force was sympathetic to frustrations among residents, but reassured them officers were “working incredibly hard to bring this sensitive policing operation to a safe conclusion”. He said he was unable to comment on how long the standoff could continue, but said “we have negotiators who are speaking to the man inside the property. I don’t think it would be appropriate to comment on what those negotiations are.” Dozens of households are within the police cordon and have been asked to stay at home as much as possible, although they are permitted to come and go with a police escort, and numerous bags of food have been delivered to them. Earlsdon primary school, just a few doors down the street from the address where the standoff is taking place, has been closed since Monday, with pupils taking part in remote learning from home. A number of businesses have also had to close their doors, including a cafe and a butchers. “I think now, on the fourth day, the frustrations are starting to set in,” said Kelly Maré, 41, owner of Make Me Up beauty salon around the corner from the closed-off streets. “How is it going to end? When is it going to end? Something at some point has got to give. But we just hope it ends peacefully.” She said most people thought the presence of the child in the building was the main reason behind why the standoff had been going on for so long. “If the man was just there on his own, maybe it wouldn’t be so drawn out,” she said. “If he is doing it for attention he is definitely getting that. But it’s the wider community who are affected, it’s impacting on businesses and pupils and teachers.” O’Toole’s cafe, which has been shut since Monday, said in a Facebook post that it was “such a stressful situation for all of the small business[es] involved but there is little, actually nothing, we can do but wait and pray for a good outcome”. “I feel for the people stuck in their homes in the cordon. And I feel for the businesses, they’re losing money and they’re not going to get it back,” said 74-year-old Joyce Askew, who lives just outside the cordon. “I think everyone thought it would be sorted by now.” “They’ve got to do what they’ve got to do. He’s obviously in distress and I just feel like you’ve got to be patient and just get on with,” said Rachel, who lives nearby and has a six-year-old daughter at the closed primary school. “But I’m fortunate in that I’m not working so childcare is not too difficult for us.

1/13/2022,"A prominent opposition figure and senator has been shot dead in Bamenda city in Cameroon’s restive north-western anglophone region. Gunmen forced Henry Kemende out ​from​ his car and then shot him in the​ ​chest, ​his Social Democratic Front party said, blaming separatist fighters. Politicians and civil society groups have condemned the killing.  No group has claimed responsibility, but assassinations by armed separatists of figures deemed to be working with Cameroonian authorities are common in the north-west and south-west anglophone regions. The regions have been beset by violence since 2017, after protesters took to the streets in 2016 accusing the francophone-dominated authorities of marginalisation and of attempting to assimilate their education and legal systems into the dominant francophone system. The protests were brutally suppressed, fuelling violence from armed separatist groups. Both the separatists and government forces have been accused of atrocities in the fighting, which has killed more than 3,000 people and forced more than 700,000 to flee their homes. Groups from the minority English-speaking regions have sought to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia and have been accused of several gun and bomb attacks. Schools in particular have been targeted, escalating an education boycott that began in 2017 and has deprived a generation of Cameroonian children of an education, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Cameroonian security forces have been routinely accused of human rights abuses against anglophones, especially in rural areas. Kemende was elected a senator for the Social Democratic Front in 2018, and was a high-profile critic of government failures to solve the crisis. “We recovered his body, his chest riddled with bullets,” Joshua Osih, the vice-president of the SDF, told Agence France-Presse. Osih said separatist elements opposed the SDF because it is a predominantly English-speaking party that participates in the political process and is opposed to the partition of Cameroon. Richard Tamfu, a human rights lawyer and member of Cameroon Bar Council, described Kemende as an inspirational figure in Cameroon. “We call on the government to immediately open investigations for his killers to be brought to book,” Tamfu said. Cameroon’s military said two other people were also killed by separatists on Tuesday night, and three other civilians, including two women, abducted and taken to an unknown destination. Cameroon’s government has tried to distance itself from the anglophone crisis and the country’s fragile security situation while it hosts the Africa Cup of Nations – the first time it has done so in 50 years. The government has assured teams and spectators that security for the football tournament is guaranteed, and heightened security has been put in place in host cities. Yet unrest remains a significant challenge. On Wednesday, gunfire was heard across the city of Buea in south-west Cameroon, the home base for the football teams of Mali, Tunisia, the Gambia and Mauritania. The cause was not immediately clear on Wednesday. Buea is about 30km from Limbe, a coastal city where two games are being played on Wednesday.",News/World news,Cameroonian senator shot dead in lawless anglophone region,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/cameroonian-senator-shot-dead-in-unruly-anglophone-region
1/13/2022,"The head of the International Energy Agency has accused Russia of orchestrating Europe’s deepening energy crisis at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions by withholding up to a third of its gas exports. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, directly blamed Russia’s behaviour for the record-high energy market prices in Europe this winter that threaten to upend large parts of the European economy and plunge millions into a cost of living crisis.  He said the historic low gas storage levels across Europe were largely due to Russia’s state-owned gas company, Gazprom, which has sent about 25% less gas than usual to Europe over recent months despite a surge in demand after 2020’s economic slump.“We believe there are strong elements of tightness in the European gas market due to Russia’s behaviour,” Birol said reporters on Wednesday. “I would note that today’s low Russian gas flows to Europe coincide with heightened geopolitical tensions over Ukraine.” The IEA’s most damning criticism of Russia’s energy policy to date has emerged after the Kremlin downplayed hopes of diplomatic solutions for the ongoing Ukraine crisis on Tuesday, before a meeting in Brussels between Russia and Nato’s 30 member states. This week Russian forces deployed along the Ukraine border conducted a live-fire military exercise involving 3,000 troops and tanks, in a clear rejection of US demands for a de-escalation in the region. At the same time, the world’s biggest supplier of gas has opted to keep a lid on gas exports to Europe where market prices have surpassed the all-time highs set in September to reach a new record last month. Analysts estimate that Europe’s gas prices could fall by half if Russia agreed to increase its exports by 20%. Gazprom has claimed it is meeting all its contracted exports to European companies. “The current storage deficit in the European Union is largely due to Gazprom,” Birol said. “The low levels of storage in company’s EU-based facilities account for half of the EU storage deficit although Gazprom facilities only constitute 10% of the EU’s total storage capacity.” Chris O’Shea, the head of the UK’s largest home energy supplier, British Gas, warned that prices were likely to remain high for at least another two years, based on the current outlook for global energy markets and the UK’s ongoing reliance on fossil fuels. “There’s no reason to think that energy prices will come down any soon — the market suggests that high prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years,” he told the BBC on Wednesday morning. “As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel, so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, there’s more demand for gas, but there isn’t an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly.” The prediction could prove devastating for UK households, which face a cost of living crisis after a record increase in energy bills this winter due to the global gas crisis. The rising cost of fossil fuels has also led to record pump prices and may stoke rising inflation across the economy in the months ahead. O’Shea said it was “inconceivable” for the government and energy suppliers to fail to take action to protect households from rising energy bills, which could reach an average of £2,000 by April. He repeated the industry’s calls for the government to remove the 5% VAT rate from energy bills, shift green levies into general taxation and defer charges taken via energy bills to cover the cost of a string of recent supplier collapses.",News/Business,"Russia is orchestrating Europe’s gas crisis, says energy agency boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/russia-europe-gas-crisis-international-energy-agency-boss
1/13/2022,"There was a time not long ago when we had plenty of time; now there’s too much to do. Lockdowns dragged on for ever when we were in them but feel shorter as they edge further into the past. I have heard lockdowns described – often by the kind of people who protested they were unnecessary – as a middle-class luxury. This made me feel even worse about how much I was enjoying the whole experience while so many people’s circumstances made it unbearable for them. What I was luxuriating in was time. I had time to sit, time to read, time to cook, iron, doze, exercise, garden and all the other things I can never normally fit in. Once I had done all those things, and added in some new hobbies – darts, language learning, etc – I was at risk of running out of time all over again, ironically. But I wrested back control; I knew I had to because the preciousness of time had become clear to me.  Now, though, despite my best efforts at buttressing, the dam has burst; the demands on my time have come flooding through. The watery metaphor is apt, surely, because inundated is the word we often use to describe our workload when it’s overwhelming us. There are so many people to see, jobs to do, places to visit; so much work to prepare for, stuff to write, food to cook. Please don’t think for a minute that I’m doing any of these things well. I’m not. I’m just doing more things worse. Each evening I retire to bed convincing myself, based on no evidence whatsoever, that tomorrow will be the day I finally get everything I need to do done – and done well. I set my alarm to go off ever earlier to give myself a little more, yes, time. Each morning starts promisingly enough with the compiling of a list of jobs. The task at the top of the list is attacked with some gusto and may even be completed. The next few tasks will be started but not finished, as time to get on with subsequent tasks seems to be running out. By midday, entirely new tasks appear on the list; by mid-afternoon several plates are spinning and smashing and being replaced; by late afternoon, the dozens of jobs under way are all unfinished and others haven’t been started at all; by early evening, defeat has to be acknowledged and the white flag is run up the flagpole. Exhausted, I spend a couple of hours expending what little energy I have left on self-flagellation. Then to bed, in preparation for the following day’s brave new dawn. I am told that one solution is to dispense with the mundane stuff and really prioritise. But the mundane stuff is my only refuge. The last couple of days have been typical. I am helping my brother with some building work. He would say “helping” rather than helping. At the same time I have had several pieces to write; hungry mouths to feed; shows to prepare for; and other unforeseen stuff seeping in by text and email. I was tasked to demolish a low wall but, after a couple of hits, got distracted by something, put the lump hammer down, and couldn’t find it again. I was switched to clearing-up duties but lost first one set of gloves then another. Going back into the house to look for some more, in my efforts to remove a wellington boot, I pulled a hamstring. I limped past the ironing board and saw that some needed doing. For the only time all day, dealing with one T-shirt, four handkerchiefs and several tea towels, the prospect of real happiness loomed. But my reverie was interrupted by my brother hammering on the window, enquiring, in industrial language, what on earth I was playing at, which was a fair question. And so, the ironing too remained unfinished. It’s time something changed.

1/13/2022,"Stephen Colbert observed another grim milestone in the two-year saga of grim Covid milestones for the US: on Monday, the US notched a record 1.5m new Covid infections due to the surge of the Omicron variant. “That is terrible,” the Late Show host said, “but kinda sweet that we all gave each other the same thing for Christmas”.  The US also saw a record-breaking 145,000 Covid hospitalizations, with experts predicting a peak in the 300,000 range, though the CDC has offered a clarification on that statistic. Its director, Rochelle Walensky, estimated that 40% of the patients hospitalized with Covid are not presenting because of Covid symptoms, but coming in for something else and then having the virus detected. “OK sure, but even if people aren’t coming in for Covid initially, the hospitals are still overflowing,” Colbert noted. “That’s like saying ‘uh, technically, up to 40% of the people who drowned on the Titanic were already wet because they were in the bathtub when the ship went down, so not so bad.’” Meanwhile, America’s resident Covid expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, finally reached the end of his rope with antagonistic Republican lawmakers on Tuesday. During a congressional hearing, the White House’s top immunologist called out the Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky for misleading and baseless accusations. “What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue, is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there, and I have threats upon my life, harassment of my family with obscene phone calls, because people are lying about me,” Fauci said. “That’s just terrible. Dr Fauci should not be getting obscene phone calls from violent crazies,” said Colbert. “He should be getting them from lonely singles who saw his InStyle magazine cover.” Pointing to Paul’s campaign website, in which a donation tab is accompanied by a “Fire Dr Fauci banner,” Fauci also blasted Paul for “making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain”. “A pretty damning accusation,” Colbert said. “In response, Rand Paul sent out an email: ‘Dr Fauci tried to smear me by saying I’m profiting from the pandemic. Prove him wrong by donating $10, $20, or $100 today!’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel lamented pandemic fatigue, which has forced health officials to urge Americans not to catch Covid on purpose. “They have to tell us that? ‘Please don’t intentionally give yourself a deadly disease,’” Kimmel joked. “Here’s the thing: there are only so many doctors, and there are only so many nurses, and there are only so many hospital beds,” he added. “When everyone tries to get something all at the same time, it’s a disaster. Didn’t we learn nothing from the great toilet paper crisis of 2020?” In non-Covid news, the treasury department has predicted a “frustrating” tax season for the overwhelmed IRS, “which is a shame, because it’s normally so homey and warm”, Kimmel deadpanned. “It’s funny, you know, when the IRS is behind on getting their refunds to us, they take all the time they need,” he continued. “When we’re a day late paying them, they’re like ‘and which prison would you like to go to?’” According to the New York Times, the beleaguered department had fewer than 15,000 employees to handle more than 240m calls – that’s 16,000 calls per person – during the 2021 filing season that left over 35m unprocessed returns. “That’s why Trump never pays taxes,” Kimmel joked. “He knows how overworked these people are. It’s called being considerate.”",Arts/Culture,Colbert on Omicron: ‘Kinda sweet that we all gave each other the same thing for Christmas’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/12/stephen-colbert-late-night-omicron
1/13/2022,"During the first wave of the pandemic, hospital workers had a great deal to say about the horrendous choices they were being forced to make on oversubscribed, underequipped wards. Why should one person deserve a ventilator more than another? How would you make that call, at speed? There was the life-or-death nature of the decisions. The pressure was unbearable. Almost two years later, with Covid-19 still putting a strain on health services across the world, the rest of us are perhaps experiencing a more diffuse form of “decision fatigue”. While the choices themselves may not be as obviously acute, they are nonetheless concerned with mortality. Would you trust a rapid lateral flow test in a situation that really mattered? Is it OK to go to the gym? Which is safer, taxi or public transport?  In industrialised nations, the average person makes about 35,000 decisions a day. Happily, most of these will be insignificant enough to be made while barely registering – what to eat, what to wear, what to watch. But factor in a load of new, stressful decisions requiring unfamiliar forms of knowledge, maybe biological or mathematical, and the effects are compounded. According to an article published by the American Medical Association, a person with decision fatigue may experience tiredness and brain fog, and this is likely to become worse over the course of a day. When your brain gets overloaded it starts to look for ways out. You are liable to put off decisions, make them rashly, pretend there isn’t a problem or get stuck painfully wavering. As if that isn’t bad enough, you may also find yourself losing your temper, binge eating or impulse buying; decision fatigue can affect your capacity to self-regulate. It’s hard to feel OK when your mind is overburdened, assessing both the immediate risks and knock-on consequences of a mutating virus. Plus it’s not just the virus that changes, but also the policies to deal with it. The rollout of vaccines and treatments means that the calculations you have to make require constant recalibration. We are increasingly invited to make our own judgments, and these may very well be at odds with the ideas of those around us. What if your teenage kids want to go to an indoor party? Will it cause a row? Who’s to say whose opinion should hold sway in a situation with so many variables? Perhaps your kids’ mental health would be greatly improved by a slightly risky outing. Not to mention your own. Even if you think you know your own mind, you may find yourself coming up against the minds of others, who also have a point. On the bright side, the end may finally be in sight, but we now know from experience that pandemics don’t back down without a fight. Just when you think it’s safe to go back in the water, it isn’t. The problem is that one of the big hazards of decision fatigue is recklessness. If we get it into our heads that the worst is over, we may be tempted to rush back into old habits, and as a consequence place ourselves in high-risk environments. If you think you may be experiencing Covid decision fatigue you’re not alone, and there are things you can do about it. Rather than attempting to ride out the end of the pandemic in a haze of nightclubs and regrettable purchases, a better option may be to rethink your decision-making processes. First, try to make all important decisions in the mornings, before your faculties begin to deteriorate. And second, try to reduce the number of decisions you make. Definitely don’t start thinking about where to go on holiday just yet. Eat the same thing for breakfast every day. Keep the same haircut for a while. Walk the same dog around the same park in the same direction. Don’t create options when one solution works just fine. We live in a society in which an ever increasing number of products and services are sold to us, and we have lost sight of the merits of simplicity. If anything positive can be gleaned from this moment in time, it is that we can choose to have less choice. That way we can spend all day every day contemplating the important decisions, like how best to use our last two LFTs. And with luck, by the time we’ve worked it out, all this will seem like a bad dream.

1/13/2022,"Drink- and drug-spiking has reached “epidemic” levels in the UK and is now so common it can happen to anyone, campaigners have told a new parliamentary inquiry into the problem. The home affairs select committee was told that up to 15% of women and 7% of men have been spiked with alcohol or drugs.  Hannah Stratton, a 51-year-old from Cornwall, told the committee that she was “violently ill” when her drink was drugged at a “quiet bar” in Newquay. She also revealed that her two daughters had suffered the same fate, and told MPs: “Now the conversation seems to be not, ‘Has anybody been drugged this weekend?’ It’s, ‘Who has been drugged this weekend?’ It’s so commonplace.” When Stratton blogged about her experience, she said she was contacted by 100 people who said the same had happened to them, the committee heard. Helena Conibear, the chief executive of the Alcohol Education Trust (AET), said its survey of 747 people found that 94 (12.6%) had been spiked, with a prevalence of 15% among females and 7% among males. “Shockingly, only 8% of those who’d been spiked reported it to the police or to a medic,” she said. She pointed out that a separate survey of 23,000 students from 19 universities showed that 11% of them had been spiked. Conibear told the committee: “We need more research into what is driving what is truly an epidemic. If one in 10 people are experiencing spiking, we really have to do something about it.” She said: “Our message is it can be any drink, in pretty much any location and it can happen to any person.” She added that 35% of incidents occurred at private parties. “What is very frightening about that is that spiking is taking place, or being permitted by, a wider friendship group.” Conibear and Dawn Dines, the founder of the Stamp Out Spiking campaign, urged MPs to recommend making spiking a specific criminal offence. Conibear said: “The reason why spiking is so prevalent is because the perpetrators know that there are no ramifications at the moment.” The MPs were told that data released by 23 police forces under freedom of information laws showed there were 1,466 reports of spiking incidents last year, up from 722 in the year before. Conibear said: “There were just nine charges in 2019, eight in 2020, and one that we’re aware of in 2021.” The Conservative MP James Daly asked the witnesses if they thought spiking was the “most widespread criminal repeated act at this moment in time in this country”. Both Conibear and Dines said it was. Zara Owen, a 20-year-old student at Nottingham University, told the committee how she was injected with drugs while at a nightclub last year. “I woke up with a really sharp, agonising pain in my leg, which left me limping. The fact that someone has injected a narcotic into my body without me being aware is terrifying.” The former children’s minister Tim Loughton praised Owen for speaking about the problem. He said: “When I was at school, this is what happened to Bulgarian secret agents or in James Bond movies.” Alexi Skitinis told MPs he had “severe” kidney problems after having his drink spiked at a club in Las Vegas. Skitinis, from south Wales, said: “Three days later I ended up in hospital. Obviously, it was a very scary time. I want to make people aware of this. I know the majority of people who are spiked are females, but anyone can be spiked at any time. I didn’t touch alcohol for nearly two years after.” He said he didn’t report it. He said: “It would have been brushed under the carpet.”",News/Society,"Drink-spiking is at ‘epidemic’ levels in UK, campaigners tell MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/drink-spiking-uk-campaigners-mps-inquiry
1/13/2022,"The Royal Navy will fail unless it transforms and “we will lose”, the outgoing deputy of the service has said in a farewell message to personnel and civil servants in which he bemoaned what he saw as an inadequate status quo. V Adm Nick Hine posted a candidly worded letter on Twitter in which he said change had to happen, and that he had sometimes despaired at the type of thinking around him.  His time in the role corresponded with a period in which – as the Commons defence committee said in a report last month – spending on the navy and the wider military had been capped despite it facing changing threats and taking on additional responsibilities. “Please understand that the need for and, the value of change, is not a fantasy – if we don’t transform we will fail and we will lose. It is that simple,” he wrote, adding that he was also addressing “pedants and naysayers”. Those who had known him for a long time would know that his “big bugbear” was that “our great navy has lost its ambition”, he wrote. “I have despaired at times that collectively we had become self-censoring, risk-averse and lacking in curiosity, confidence and critical thinking skills. “We have these qualities but have allowed a rose-tinted view of tradition and a spurious belief that you can avoid risk by sticking to a failing status quo to avoid driving transformation.” The defence committee report identified a series a challenges the navy faces, including delays to crucial procurement programmes as a result of budget cuts, an increasing reliance on allies and successive governments’ prioritisation of ships’ defensive rather than offensive capabilities. “When ships do get to sea they act like porcupines – well defended herbivores with limited offensive capabilities. This is a result of decisions by successive governments to limit budgets and prioritise defensive capabilities,” it said. “These significant challenges have not prevented the Navy delivering significant successes, most notably the commissioning of the two aircraft carriers and the 2021 carrier strike group deployment to the Indo-Pacific. However, they do raise concerns about the Navy’s ability to deliver the crucial transformations it has planned.” Boris Johnson selected the head of the navy as the next chief of Britain’s armed forces for the first time in 20 years in October, a choice intended to reinforce the UK’s post-Brexit switch in focus to the Indo-Pacific region. Downing Street also published an integrated review of defence and foreign policy earlier last year, a key feature of which was to call for a significant British re-engagement in the Indo-Pacific, which had been abandoned in the late 1960s. Sea power is seen to be at the heart of competing with China, which has the world’s largest navy. The UK signed a three-country pact with the US last month to supply long-range nuclear-powered submarines for Australia.",News/UK news,"Royal Navy will fail without reform, says outgoing deputy chief",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/royal-navy-will-fail-without-reform-says-outgoing-deputy-chief
1/13/2022,"Yellowstone, a violent drama about familial legacy and the tides of changes in the mountains of Montana, is the most-watched show on cable in the US, though depending on where you live, you might not know it. The Paramount Network drama starring Kevin Costner as the stony, scheming owner of the largest contiguous ranch in the US drew over 11 million people for its fourth season finale earlier this month without streaming, ratings not seen since the heyday of such 2010s staples as Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, which were both broadly popular and critically feted. (The HBO fantasy epic’s sixth season, for example, averaged 10.61 million first-week viewers including streaming; AMC’s zombie apocalypse staple peaked in its fifth season from 2014-2015 with an average of 14.4 million viewers per episode).  Yet despite batting in the same league as Thrones and The Walking Dead without a clear streaming outlet (full seasons were licensed to NBC’s Peacock, while new episodes land on CBS’s nascent streaming network Paramount+), Yellowstone doesn’t court the critical attention or media scrutiny as its ratings predecessors. Co-creator Taylor Sheridan (who also serves as head writer and occasional director) has drawn accolades for gritty neo-westerns such as Sicario, Hell or High Water and Wind River, but Yellowstone, which premiered in 2018, has been ignored by awards shows. (It received its first major nomination, a 2022 Screen Actors Guild nod for best ensemble in a drama, on Wednesday.) Culture websites such as Vulture and the Ringer publish episode-by-episode recaps, but there’s not nearly the essays, media Twitter chatter or substantive analyses of, say, HBO’s Succession, the buzzy and bruising portrait of a media conglomerate family which parallels Yellowstone’s thematic frame – mega-wealth, squabbling siblings, a family guarding its assets – and offers a stark contrast to its lack of critical attention. Streaming was supposed to be the great equalizer, for either access to content (see: global megahits like Netflix’s Squid Game, the South Korean dystopian drama which reached a whopping 111m households worldwide in late 2021) or its segmentation into competitive platforms warring for their niche and slice of IP. Yellowstone presents a fascinating rebuke to these trends: a word-of-mouth hit in the heartland, for lack of a better term for the loose but distinct geographical segmentation in the US, and a phenomenon of cultural silos between urban-skewing consumers of premium cable and ex-urban (smaller cities surrounded by agricultural land, suburbs, small towns, rural communities) consumers of basic cable. Paramount is building a popular universe around the success of Yellowstone – the prequel 1883, starring the country super couple Tim McGraw and Faith Hill as well as Sam Elliott, scored the biggest debut for a cable show since 2015 in December – and a good portion of the country hasn’t noticed. It’s difficult not to compare Yellowstone and Succession, both on a superficial level and as an indicator of cultural bubbles. Though tonally opposite – Succession is serrated, cynical and lyrically profane, Yellowstone elegaic, melodramatic and prone to philosophical musings – both depict ultra-wealthy scions scrambling to protect their assets (a media conglomerate akin to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp; a ranch the size of Rhode Island) from threats outside the family (other companies; property developers and Native American tribes seeking restitution). Both traffic in arcane business disputes (hostile takeovers and shareholder meetings, land and water use rights). Both patriarchs prefer to travel via helicopter, while the offspring (three sons and one daughter, the hardest of them all) compete for attention and approval. Both have established lush visual motifs to communicate elevated ambitions – for Succession, airy and impersonal luxury suggest the utter soullessness of mega-wealth; for Yellowstone, wide-shots of mountainous country and unsparing depictions of ranch work argue one’s land is the soul worth fighting for. But for all the cultural fixation, Succession only pulls a fraction of Yellowstone’s audience. The Emmy-winning drama drew its largest audience to date, 1.7 million viewers across all platforms (including HBO Max), for its third season finale in December, largely concentrated in major cities where it has grown as a word-of-mouth hit (and meme generator) for the online; 73% of its audience for the recent finale were located in so-called A markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Yellowstone, by contrast, has ballooned in popularity outside of the major markets, which account for 28% of its fourth season viewers, according to the Wall Street Journal. The season premiere in November 2021, for example, drew 14.7 million viewers without streaming, and performed particularly well in smaller cities whose agricultural foundations resonate with the show’s bread-and-butter sequences of ranching and focus on property disputes – Abilene, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Lexington, Kentucky; and Topeka, Kansas, not to mention the area around Bozeman, Montana, where the show is largely set. Part of this divide comes down to the mechanics of delivery – basic cable, which contains the Paramount Network, reached peak market saturation in 2010 with 105m households; as of 2021, it’s down to approximately 82.9 million, and skews older. HBO and HBO Max, a premium cable network and streaming service, had in contrast 45.2 million US subscribers last year. Part is due to savvy marketing pushes by Paramount’s parent company, ViacomCBS, which has pushed the show in smaller markets. And part comes down to theme: more than anything else, Yellowstone is preoccupied with property ownership – most conflicts stem from Costner’s John Dutton and his family striving to keep the ranch in their name – an idealization of the American dream of homeownership that resonates with audiences outside cities of mobile renters, and in places where possession of physical assets dictates local power. In other words, Yellowstone is the show of what historian historian Patrick Wyman has called the American Gentry – the class of land and business-owning local elites in smaller markets across the country, whose politics tend to skew conservative and whose influence tends to go under-covered in comparison to flashy oligarchs, billionaires and those whose wealth isn’t tied to a specific place. As inherited wealth in the US tends to go, this class is disproportionately white, as is Yellowstone’s audience; the show consistently scores among TV’s least diverse viewership in the US (in February 2021, for example, Yellowstone drove the lowest proportion of non-white viewership of all shows, with 23%, according to TV analytics firm Samba). Yellowstone’s conservative ethos has led some commentators to champion it as a rebuke of liberal media – the former View host Meghan McCain, for example, attributed its success to being “not woke”, and several outlets have labeled it “prestige TV for conservatives”. Which is true, to an extent; Yellowstone is conservative in the lower-case sense, as in its main preoccupation is a sense of a way of life (that being white ranch owners) under threat by progress, outsiders and a changing culture. “I don’t know if it’s a uniquely American fear or just a human fear: the fear that a way of life is ending,” Sheridan told the New York Times in late December 2021. “It’s what drives our politics right now. I think it’s a massive theme, this fear of losing someone that you love or a place that you love. That’s pretty universal.” Sheridan is on to something. It is an over-simplification to dismiss Yellowstone as “red-state Succession” but the show’s aspirational wealth and fantasy of victimhood (and genuinely entertaining romance, insults and conversational chess) has clearly resonated outside the bounds of critical buzz concentrated in liberal-leaning cities. Depending on your social circle, this is either self-evident or surprising – a fact that, like the show drawing millions of Americans to live television a week, demands serious scrutiny.",Arts/Television & radio,Yellowstone: the smash-hit TV show that exposed a cultural divide,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/12/yellowstone-the-smash-hit-tv-show-that-exposed-a-cultural-divide
1/13/2022,"After three hours and 13 minutes of scurrying from one end of the court to another in order to blunt one of the most devastating shotmakers in the game, Andy Murray survived to reach the quarter-finals of the Sydney International by defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3), 6-3 in a tense, quality battle that ended after midnight. Despite the tremendous fight required to see out the match, that it took so long was primarily down to Murray’s own timidity when looking to consolidate a lead. Murray served for the first set at 5-3 and then 5-4 in the second, but each time Murray was dragged back into two tie-breaks, which he and the second seed split between them.  The turbulence was also just a feature of Basilashvili’s presence in the match and his ability to catch fire in short bursts and practically render the opponent, no matter their status, a spectator in their own match. But only for short periods. “He’s hitting the ball consistently bigger than anyone on the tour, he was just taking huge cuts at everything,” said Murray of the world No 23. “I was having to do a lot of defending, a lot of running. My legs stood up well at the end. I served really well in the last set.” Murray will now face David Goffin in the quarter-finals. The Belgian is a former world No 7 who had spent a long time inside the top 15 until recently but Murray has a perfect 6-0 record against him. “He had a tough year last year. He had a surgery, I think, on his elbow, missed a lot of tennis. He was around 15 in the world for a number of years when the injury came.” It will also tell a lot about the state of Murray’s body and hip as he is scheduled to compete in the day on Thursday rather than resting. He is looking to reach his first ATP semi-final since 2018. Earlier in the week, he spoke of how important it is for him to start making instant strides forward and finding good results, and he has already put himself in position to take further steps forward. Meanwhile, Dan Evans continued his spotless start to the season as he defeated Pedro Martínez 6-2, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals in Sydney. Evans has now won six matches a row, including an unbeaten spell at the ATP Cup in the opening week of the season.

1/13/2022,"My 27-year-old son is the father of a two-year-old girl. He and his girlfriend broke up shortly after the baby was born. They had been living with his girlfriend’s family and she had agreed to move in with my son and his father after three months. When she changed her mind he felt betrayed and the relationship deteriorated. I had concerns about their plan to have a baby from the beginning but we were only informed once she was pregnant. My issue is that my son has not paid child support to date. He says he will start paying once his ex-girlfriend allows him unsupervised visitation with his daughter.  He perceives his ex-girlfriend as controlling and vengeful. I feel she is bitter about how things ended, but she is a good mother and protective of her child. My son has recently expressed an interest in another girl, and mentioned that he might have a baby with her. I am very upset at his irresponsible attitude towards parenting, so I said that I would not speak to him again if he impregnated another woman without at least a minimum of commitment in terms of living independently and financial support. I am wondering what I should do if this situation should arise? Eleanor says: Let me start with an observation: it looks to me like a shared structure echoes through a lot of the interactions here, in which one person tries to get another to do something by using a threat or an “or else”. Your son wants his ex to change the rules about visiting his daughter, so he uses child support to try to make her. His ex wants him to be or do something different, so she holds off time with their daughter until then. And now, desperately concerned about the future, you really hope your son will make a different decision – and that the prospect of losing contact with you will make him. Unfortunately though, it’s almost impossible to crowbar other people into doing what we think they should. The problem with or-elseing in loving relationships is it tends to leave only two possible outcomes. Either the person does what we want them to, or they don’t. If they do, it can be hard afterwards for either of you to forget they only did it over a barrel you built – it’s hard for them to feel trusted, and for you to feel trusting. And if they don’t do what you wanted, you’re left having to follow through on a punishment that’s often as painful for you as it is for them. It would be so much better if we could guarantee that simply stating the ultimatum would shake some reason into them, snapping them into genuine, felt agreement. But it’s not often that someone who’s already making alarming decisions becomes more rational when they feel attacked. Often, the “or else” just adds rancour and hierarchy to an already bitter disagreement. You do have grounds to be concerned here. And if those grounds were purely about you, I’d say it was your prerogative to cut your son out. But if he does have another child – indeed, even with the first – things won’t get better for that little child with one less responsible adult around. I wonder if you could make progress instead by trying to help your son feel like someone who could provide financial security and independence, instead of just someone who should. Sometimes the parts of our lives we mess up in are the ones where we never thought we could do well: “I’m just like this.” It takes real energy and self possession to break irresponsible habits – I wonder if hearing “you are up to this task” might fuel him more than “you aren’t and you should be”. Helping people make better choices is often more about kindling their imagination than force-altering their behaviour; they need to be able to picture a different life in enough detail to chase after it. So maybe, whether he has this child or not, your goal could be to stoke that imagination. Wouldn’t it feel better to be self sufficient? Isn’t he tired of not being trusted? He has the character and ability to change! (For instance: “I really know you can be the bigger man and put [daughter] above this fight with [ex]”.) Ultimatums leave bootprints on relationships that it’s very hard to dust off. You might find, for everyone here, that real change is more likely when you invite the other person to be the one insisting that things should be better. This question has been edited for clarity.

1/13/2022,"Iused to live in Manly in Sydney and was on holidays at Byron Bay with my husband, Merv, when he said “I’m not going home”. So I went home on my own, packed up and we bought a place up in the hills at Federal [in the Byron Bay hinterland] for $235,000. I sold that after he died 22 years ago and I came into town to be closer to the beach. Merv was a big smoker but when he died after an 18-month battle with bone cancer they found disease everywhere except in his lungs. He would have said “I told you so”. Men always have the last say.  He died in the winter and it was raining. He would have been very happy about that because he loved having rainwater in the tanks. The first time I went to the beach, about a month after Merv died, it was pretty good. I was with his brother and we scattered some of Merv’s ashes in the water. His brother said “bon voyage” but the ashes kept washing in to the beach again. It was clear Merv didn’t want to go. We had a bit of a giggle about that. That was the day I started seeing the birds in the sky. When Merv was in hospital he used to watch the kites flying outside his window. That day a big kite eyeballed me all the way along the beach. It was amazing. I was married for more than 60 years, and there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think of him. He’s my anchor. He was a sailor and he keeps me bound to the earth and he’s not ready for me just yet. He always said he’d come back as a sea eagle and I always look up when I’m at the beach. They are so often above me and I think “There he is, he’s there”. I used to be called Lorraine. When my mother died she left me some money and said I needed to go to Africa. The day I was due to leave, I got out of the shower and there was a feather on the floor. I put it in my wallet and still have it. After Merv died I started writing poetry and would sign it “Lone Feather”. The kids around town started to call me Feather. Whenever I went down to the beach there were always feathers. I’ve still got heaps of feathers in the house, they are everywhere. I’ve always loved the beach, because I didn’t have to wear many clothes. I used to go topless and was still going topless two years ago but the place – the Goddess pool – where I used to sit is no longer there, so I’ll leave going topless up to the young people. I used to get my middle finger painted at the salon and I’d just give people the finger if they stared at me. I don’t have to give them the finger any more. I’ve got a few health problems - turning 80 seems to be the magic number when things go wrong. I had to give up riding my bike to the beach but I have friends who take me and we sit there for a few hours. We lost a lot of the beach with the erosion.

1/13/2022,"Amid a flurry of data breaches, password leaks and Malware text scams last year, many of us have become more aware of the need to secure our digital information. Unfortunately, coming up with endless unique passwords for all our banking, shopping, working, schooling and subscribing accounts is tedious, memorising those passwords is near impossible, and relying on the classic “123456” password won’t cut it. Enter the password manager, the trusty vault of codes long forgotten, helping us access and secure our digital lives.  Password managers store a user’s login information in a master database. It automates the process of entering a site, supporting that user to create more complex passwords virtually invulnerable to password-linked scam attacks. The only password you will have to remember is your master password – the key to your master database. Set up is simple. It starts with registering for an online account, which includes deciding on that master password. After sign up, add the password manager extension to your browser, and install the password manager’s app on to all devices. On each device, sign in with that master password, and you’re set. Most password managers will give you the option to import saved passwords from your browser. Otherwise, continue using your device as usual. When you go to log in to a new site, you’ll be prompted to save that username and password in the manager. Though most web browsers like Chrome offer an inbuilt password manager, security experts suggest using a dedicated password manager able to suggest the generation of stronger passwords and prioritise the secure storage of your login information. If you’re looking for a free password manager with an easy-to-use interface, Bitwarden has been declared “the best choice” by Wired. A semi-automated password fill-in tool that supports switching between multiple accounts, Bitwarden makes login across several usernames on the same device efficient. Bitwarden is available across Android, Windows, Linux, iOS, MacOS, and most web browser extensions, and offers the option to be installed on a self-hosted server. For a password manager with more features, 1Password, at $3 a month, also notifies a user if their password is weak, and cross checks their password against the Have I Been Pwned site to warn of any potential login breaches. 1Password also offers authentication, similar to that of Google Authenticator, adding encryption security with a secret key. A password manager will replace the Post-it note on your desk that holds each scribbled variation of the same login you use across the internet. It will also help replace the logins themselves, with passwords a little stronger than your pet’s name.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: ditch the infinite, impossible passwords and set up a password manager",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/13/easy-wins-ditch-the-infinite-impossible-passwords-and-set-up-a-password-manager
1/13/2022,"Empty supermarket shelves, businesses temporarily closed, holiday plans thrown into turmoil. You could be forgiven for thinking you’d accidentally landed back in the first few months of 2020, so what is going on?  Australia’s food supply is at risk, businesses are having trouble staying open due to staff shortages and workers are losing income as the highly contagious Omicron variant of Covid-19 rips through the community. There are already shortages of some types of chicken, and fresh fruit and vegetables could be left to rot on farms if supply chains can’t be quickly shored up. Meanwhile, music festivals have been cancelled and businesses and unions say there’s an unofficial lockdown happening on the east coast as people shun retail and hospitality businesses in an effort to avoid catching Covid. No. The shortage of adBlue, which is made from urea and used to reduce emissions from diesel engines, is not helping. But the main cause of the crisis is the fact that Omicron is extremely contagious – there were at least 630,000 new cases in the past week, almost double the number the week before. And the true number will be higher again because testing has fallen and NSW is yet to start reporting the results of rapid antigen tests, as Victoria does. The shortage of rapid antigen tests has also been a factor, businesses and unions say. They saw the surge in case numbers once Australia opened up coming and in October asked the federal government to make rapid antigen tests free for small and medium sized businesses to test their staff. Many employees – up to half in some businesses – have been unable to go to work because they are either sick with Covid or isolating because they are a close contact, waiting for a test, or waiting for a test result. The staff shortages have caused chaos as they ripple through the long supply chains that get the food we eat from the farm to the supermarket. There is more to this than a shortage of truck drivers, although that is one of the key choke points. For example, some types of chicken are in short supply because there have been staffing shortages in the boning rooms that chop up carcasses into thighs, breasts and the like. On the other hand, fruit and vegetables are currently most vulnerable to delays in distribution centres that mean quick-to-spoil leafy greens could become harder to find. Not all businesses are equally affected by the crisis. Those fortunate enough to have rigid testing protocols or a workforce that stays on one site appear to have faced less disruption. But others, including retailers, say they are getting smashed and need urgent financial support from state and federal governments. Some say the situation is worse than during lockdown, when they at least had jobkeeper or disaster payments to keep the lights on. The crisis comes on top of an existing shortage of staff that saw job vacancies surge as lockdowns ended in the September to November period last year. Job openings jumped 18.5% from the previous three months to 396,100, or almost three-quarters higher than February 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Adding to Australia’s woes, the global logistics crisis has not gone away. Problems getting goods from overseas ports and into shops will persist well into this year, Oxford Economics said on Tuesday. With more staff off because of Covid, increased port operating hours may not be enough to clear out congestion, the UK-based forecasting group said. It said truck drivers were also in short supply – a problem that needs higher wages and better conditions to fix – and “warehouses are bursting at the seams across many countries” due to a surge in online shopping. No one knows. But there are more challenges ahead. Epidemiologists say the peak of the Omicron wave in NSW, which is currently Australia’s Covid hotspot, won’t be behind us until the middle of February. At the same time, construction workers will return to sites at the start of February after their regular summer break – something that the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, predicts will put pressure on the supply chains of the industries that feed into building. Schools return after Australia Day, opening up another potential transmission vector from children to parents, although studies on Delta have suggested transmission rates in these settings may be low. There’s also the looming prospect of an industrial dispute on the docks, with the Maritime Union of Australia and Patricks Stevedores on a collision course over the company’s threat to cancel an enterprise agreement governing working conditions – something the union says would “see Australian supply chains grind to a halt and the flow of vital household goods evaporate in an instant”. So far, states have loosened isolation rules for people who are close contacts and work in key industries such as food manufacturing and distribution. This buys some time, but comes at the cost of potentially increasing case numbers further down the track. More measures could be announced after a meeting of national cabinet tomorrow – the Morrison government is considering relaxing isolation rules for transport and logistics, and looking to allow international students to work more than 40 hours a fortnight. Morrison has also urged patience – something that is in as short supply as workers in the business sector, which is desperate for assistance now. But so far there appears to be little appetite from state and federal governments to return to handing out cash to people and businesses. Businesses say they need money and rapid antigen tests, right now. “We need support, help and a solution which needs to start with assisting on cashflow for businesses,” Chrissie Maus, the managing director of Melbourne retail association Chapel Street Precinct, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. Unions support the call for free rapid tests for businesses but say keeping them going shouldn’t come at the expense of the health and safety of workers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “What we’re seeing is employers trying to pressure people to come into work even when they’re sick, when they’re positive,” McManus told Guardian Australia. She said people were concerned that if they said no they would lose their shifts. “There’s not the national leadership that’s saying every day in the press conferences that workers are not to come to work if they’re sick and employers, you need to support workers, including if they’re casual considering paying them while they’re off,” she said. “You know, it’s a free-for-all out there and we’re seeing the very worst come out in some employers.”",News/Australia news,From empty shelves to cancelled festivals: how Omicron is wreaking havoc across Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/from-empty-shelves-to-cancelled-festivals-how-omicron-is-wreaking-havoc-across-australia
1/13/2022,"As Covid case numbers in Australia hit record highs, so too have hospitalisation figures for the virus. Dr Clare Skinner, the president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, says presentations to emergency departments have increased in states affected by the Omicron wave.  “We’re seeing people who are [severely] sick from Covid … and then we are seeing people who present because they have tested positive to Covid and they want some assessment and treatment, but their symptoms are less severe than the other group.” “The entire system is under strain – both the hospital system and primary care,” Skinner says. Given the current burden on the healthcare system, what Covid symptoms are manageable at home, and when should you seek urgent medical assistance? There are several guidelines and support services available to help people assess Covid symptoms and whether you can manage the condition from home. These include the coronavirus hotline on 1800 675 398, the federal government’s Health Direct guidelines, and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ home care guide. “From my perspective, the worrying symptoms are things like severe difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness and not able to maintain fluid input,” Skinner says. “So if you’ve got severe vomiting and diarrhoea and you’re not able to get fluids in, or you’re not passing urine as often as you normally would, then they are reasons to seek hospital-level care.” Other red flags include worsening shortness of breath, blue lips or face, fainting or collapse, or a blood oxygen level of 92% or less as measured on a pulse oximeter, a device that indirectly measures oxygen saturation when worn over a finger. “If people do have life-threatening or urgent symptoms, I implore them to seek care either through the emergency department or their GP. No one’s going to be judgmental with them about wasting our time,” Skinner says. “We will all do our best to provide the care they need.” Common Covid symptoms include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, loss of taste or smell, chills, runny nose, and mild shortness of breath. Most people who are vaccinated will have mild to moderate symptoms if infected with Omicron, and won’t need to book an appointment with their GP, says Dr Karen Price, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. “However, people who are high risk should contact their GP,” Price says. This includes people who are unvaccinated, aged over 65, pregnant, immunocompromised or Indigenous. People who are managing their symptoms at home should consider buying a thermometer and have paracetamol or ibuprofen on hand – though pregnant women should avoid ibuprofen, Price says. “Some people self-managing at home may find it useful to record their symptoms daily, which can help show if a person’s condition is worsening.” “Now is a good time to prepare a Covid-safe plan should you or a household member get Covid and be isolating for a period of time. This would include having ready access to the guidelines as well as isolation needs, food, fluids, pets and medications. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “An oximeter may be useful for people self-managing at home, but particularly for people who have risk factors for more severe disease, in collaboration with their medical team,” Price says. “For many with mild illness this will not be necessary.” Skinner agrees: “Not everybody is going to need an oxygen saturation monitor. It’s for people who are at higher risk of deterioration with their Covid infection.” People at high risk might be given a pulse oximeter by their GP, or can buy them online or at a pharmacy – but they should be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.

A useful guide for how someone’s respiratory function is tracking is whether they are breathless at rest, Skinner says. “When you have a viral infection, it’s usual to feel a little bit breathless when you do activities. But if you’re feeling unusually breathless doing activities, you’re breathless when you’re sitting still, or so breathless you can’t speak in sentences – they’re all signs that you need to seek medical care.” Finally, Skinner encourages people with confirmed Covid to check their local health department website. “There’s a lot of misinformation circulating on social media,” she says. “Please find good sources of information.”",News/Australia news,Tested positive for Covid?

1/13/2022,"Hash Tayeh has been back behind the counter at the burger chain he founded, Burgertory, for the first time in three years as he struggles to keep the business going in the face of the Omicron wave. He has been doing night shifts at his outlet on Chapel Street in Melbourne, a fashionable shopping and entertainment strip which local traders say has been overwhelmed by Covid-related staff shortages.  The pandemic taught him to “just never get too comfortable and always be humble,” he said. “So I was helping them take orders, take out the rubbish, mop the floors, do the dishes – wherever they needed me.” Two hundred and sixty of Burgertory’s 400 staff have had Covid. In addition to working in the Chapel Street restaurant, he cut five hours a day from its opening hours. He also closed four other Burgertory outlets due to lack of staff, although he was able to reopen one of them on Wednesday. Staff shortages have ravaged Australian business, smashing apart the supply chains that supermarkets rely on to keep food on the shelves, cutting the supply of chicken, grounding planes, and crushing tourism and hospitality businesses on the east coast. Consumer confidence has plunged as casual workers are stripped of shifts while sick or isolating, and an unofficial lockdown is in place with restaurants and bars reporting fewer customers than usual as people try to dodge the virus. On Chapel Street, 35% of the 2,200 people employed either have or have had Covid, local business group Chapel Street Precinct estimated. “We’re keeping our head above water but we’re not making a profit at the moment,” Tayeh said. “There’s no state support, there’s no federal support – it’s really hard at the moment.” Chrissie Maus, the managing director of Chapel Street Precinct, is herself in isolation, recovering from Covid. She said businesses urgently need financial support. “This is a code red for retail right now.” Her group was in contact with the Victorian minister for small business, Jaala Pulford, on Wednesday afternoon to ask for a return to the $750-a-week disaster payment that Melburnians were eligible for during the city’s sixth lockdown late last year. The group has also written to the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, asking the Morrison government to stump up half the money needed. She said opening up was a “double edged sword” and businesses in the area were better off during the lockdowns when they were getting some financial support, even if it was minimal. “Right now, where we’re open and pretending everything’s fine, we get no support.” Maus recognised that there was a crisis in healthcare staffing, but said the situation was even worse in retail and hospitality. “Melbourne is absolutely standing up and screaming, ‘please, please help us like you have for the last 22 months.’” Businesses also need a supply of rapid antigen tests, which are in short supply. State and federal governments have ordered tens of millions, but the bulk are yet to arrive. “How can we have a solution that includes RAT tests when none of us can find them?” she said. Tayeh said he had a supply of rapid tests thanks to a pharmacist friend. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said closing the stores had provoked a backlash from customers but people “need to understand that we’re entering a new phase of the pandemic”. “And the only thing that’s going to help is kindness and patience, to actually understand that we’re all doing our best out there and … this will blow over in the way we’ve seen all over the world.”",News/Australia news,‘Code red’: Melbourne businesses say Omicron wave more damaging than lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/code-red-melbourne-businesses-say-omicron-wave-more-damaging-than-lockdown
1/13/2022,"Director Anthony Hayes is far from the first film-maker to have realised that the Australian outback provides great scaffolding for sparse dystopias, his tough and tense survival thriller Gold emphasising the vast, screen-buckling nothingness. Led by a grubby-looking and banged-up Zac Efron, continuing a long tradition of actors seeking critical acclaim by messing up their photogenic faces, the film is introduced with the text: “SOME TIME. SOME PLACE. NOT FAR FROM NOW…”  This is another way of saying that this South Australia-shot production is set during what Mad Max director George Miller describes as “next Wednesday”: a time in which “all the bad things we read in the news come to pass”. Happy happy joy joy Gold is not, in other words, with its vision of an ecologically ruined world that’s gone to the dogs. Hayes makes it abundantly clear from the unsubtle opening shot – a pair of vultures – that this will be a rather different vision of sand and sun than the 2017 Baywatch remake Efron starred in, torpedo buoy in hand, pectorals glistening. Although Gold is a new addition to a genre I call the “bugger dead, it’s hot” action thriller (which includes the terrific recent TV series The Tourist), Hayes makes the point that the story is not necessarily based in Australia, but the aforementioned “SOME PLACE”. This handily saves Efron from impersonating an Aussie accent and from the potential embarrassment suffered by those (like Bill Nighy, Quentin Tarantino and Kirby Howell-Baptiste) who have tried to wrap their tongues around a speaking style once described by Winston Churchill as “the most brutal maltreatment that has ever been inflicted on the mother-tongue of the great English-speaking nations”. Hayes, a veteran character actor himself, co-stars as a bloke billed as Man Two, opposite Efron’s Man One. This reflects an intentional lack of humanity in the film’s outlook, with its tendency to view people through a misanthropic lens. The two men are in the outback because Man One has discovered a huge chunk of gold in them thar desert, which leads to an awkward conversation between them thar men, about who should stay and who should go get the excavator. Efron insists on staying with the gold, despite him being a inexperienced stranger in this land, with nary a solar-powered portable fan or six pack of brewskies to make the impending experience more palatable. Gold has elements of a chamber piece, but also long stretches in which a hot and bothered Man One becomes increasingly, well, hot and bothered, fending off various hallucinations. It’s clear early on that Efron is in good hands, with Hayes being a talented director of other actors, as he demonstrated in his 2008 hard-hitting directorial debut Ten Empty. Hayes also clearly trusts Efron, who delivers a strong, gloomy and tetchy performance. It’s smart, rather than exceptional, acting: Efron understands he doesn’t need to say and do too much here; he can internalise emotion and let the atmosphere and intensity of the film wash over him. Cinematographer Ross Giardina depicts heat in an interesting way, scaling back the palette to such an extent that many scenes appear virtually colourless. Early on, when Hayes is shown having a cigarette, the smoke he exhales is almost the same colour as the sky: a chalky white more commonly seen in ice and snow. The inference of heat here comes from other places: the barrenness of the land, sweat, the clogging intensity of the drama itself. Gold is a minimalistic production, story and setting wise, with an interesting kind of contextual ambiguity: we know there is a wider world beyond the frame, though we don’t know what it looks like. Sparseness is intriguing, but this film is so damn sparse. With so little going on, for such a long time, the experience becomes gratingly thin. I admired the craft of Gold but left feeling cold – unlike, of course, Efron, who is cooked like an overripe piece of fruit tossed into an incinerator. Gold will screen in select cinemas from 13 January and premieres 26 January on Stan.",Arts/Film,Gold review – Zac Efron fries in a tough and tense outback thriller ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/gold-review-zac-efron-fries-in-a-tough-and-tense-outback-thriller
1/13/2022,"Four down, one to go. Ashes series have a special quality that can make them feel both endless and over in an instant. The rushed nature of the schedule this time around has exacerbated this. There have been more playing days than non-playing days listed since the series began in Brisbane and that’s before we get to the final match in Hobart, a city making its debut as an Ashes host on Friday. The hecticness is reflected in how many players have fallen by the wayside or are walking wounded into Bellerive Oval. Scott Boland wants to play despite hurting his ribs while falling over in Sydney. Mitchell Starc wants to play despite a four-Test workload. Jonny Bairstow wants to play despite nearly losing a thumb to Pat Cummins. Ben Stokes wants to play despite a side strain that had him grimacing every time he hit the ball out of the SCG.  Why wouldn’t they? Boland has 14 wickets in two unexpected Tests at an antediluvian average of 8.64 – the lowest of any man to have taken more than four wickets or bowled more than 51 balls. Starc has only once before made it through a five-Test series and is eyeing another chance with the pink ball that has netted him 52 wickets. Bairstow made a comeback century in Sydney before playing the defining innings in the draw, while Stokes made twin 50s that were essential to England’s escape. Those who will not appear include wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, back to England with a broken finger, and opening bowler Josh Hazlewood, who was supposed to miss one match with a side problem but will miss his fourth. Jhye Richardson may be available in his stead, but there has been muttering about a vague injury of his own since it pushed him out of the team after the second Test in Adelaide. Michael Neser could be the last Australia bowler standing. Throw that all in the pot along with Ollie Pope being a substitute wicketkeeper in Sydney and Sam Billings appearing as a last-minute squad replacement for the spot, driving from the Gold Coast to Sydney, a span that would cover the length of Great Britain, and there is a sense that these teams are stumbling into Hobart with their suitcases bursting open and scatters of illegal fruit rolling across the airport floor. Australia’s selection dilemmas are, at least, the good kind. Performance above expectation has been the norm for this series. Hazlewood has a right to come back as soon as he is fit as Australia’s premier new-ball weapon for years. Richardson has a right to come back after his match-winning five wickets on the tense last day in Adelaide. Boland has a right to keep his spot as the most simple yet effective wicket-hoover imaginable. They cannot all fit alongside a fast-bowling captain and a left-arm devastator. Starc is a quandary machine. He is an athletic bowler who hurls plenty into his action, which can be undermined by even a small drop-off in energy. He said this week that he feels fine and fit, but there is no hiding that throughout his career his output has consistently dropped off in the fourth or fifth Test of a series. But he is also the most prolific bowler in day-night Tests, that stack of wickets coming from nine appearances. Thus he has to play. The smart play would have been to rest him in Sydney, giving him a break before returning with the rosé Kookaburra. But that bird has flown. Then there is the small matter of Usman Khawaja. Australia’s selectors before the series locked themselves into the position that Travis Head was the future and Marcus Harris would be the opening bat all the way through. They cannot now stand by both of those things while also keeping Khawaja in the side. But after the rare feat of twin centuries in his one match of the series, there would be vast public discontent if Khawaja gets left out. Well-meaning plans don’t mean much to spectators who want to see the best players play. Perhaps this contest on its own does not greatly matter. With the pandemic nipping at everyone’s heels, what matters is getting it done. That the teams have made it to the fifth Test in any form is a minor miracle. There are 11 players per side available for Hobart, with a roughly correct proportion being those who bowl and those who bat. Time to finish the rush and take a deep breath once we make it to the end.",Sport/Sport,Mitchell Starc’s Ashes workload heads Australia posers for Hobart closer | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/12/mitchell-starc-ashes-australia-posers-hobart-closer-england-fifth-test-cricket
1/13/2022,"When covering the economy at the moment, it is best to remember the old joke that if you’re not confused, it is because you’re not paying attention. Things are truly nuts – partly because of the pandemic and partly because we are having to deal with data that is out of date because of the pandemic.  Take the latest retail trade figures that came out on Tuesday. They covered November last year – a time when life seemed to at least contain some degree of optimism. It was a time before the Omicron wave, and before we had to put up with wall-to-wall coverage of Novac Djokovic’s spin on why he was out and about after testing positive to Covid, and before it was announced that Gal Gadot is going to star in a remake of To Catch a Thief. Yes, things were a lot better in November. We were back shopping and doing so at a truly insane level. But then nothing about how we have been spending money in the shops has been normal since the pandemic hit. If you think you know what is going on in the economy since March 2020, I present the chart: If the graph does not display please click here In November we spent a record $33.4bn in retail shops. That is 14% more than you would have expected given the five years before the pandemic. Since March 2020, Australians have spent around $30bn more in the shops than would have been expected over that time. The big winners are those selling household goods – ie furniture, electrical goods and hardware. Total spending on such items since March 2020 is some $17bn above the pre-pandemic expectations and, in November alone, our spending on household goods was 32% above what you would have predicted in February 2020: If the graph does not display please click here Not everyone has been a winner, though. Compare the “other” retailing, which includes pharmaceutical, and recreational goods with that spent on eating out. Prior to the pandemic we coincidentally spent the same amount on both categories – since then the paths have greatly diverged: If the graph does not display please click here This matters not just because the graphs look so weird that I don’t even need to really tell you that things are wacky, but because when you see such massive weirdness, you need to realise it flows all the way through the economy – especially with jobs. And so when the latest job vacancy figures came out on Wednesday showing nearly 400,000 vacancies in November last year – 170,000 more than in November 2019 – you could be forgiven for thinking the economy is absolutely booming: If the graph does not display please click here This massive surge in vacancies meant in November there were just 1.6 unemployed per vacancy throughout Australia – a record low: If the graph does not display please click here Even if we include those underemployed, the picture remains seemingly good given the prior to the pandemic there were 8.3 underutilised persons per job vacancy and in November there were just 4.2: If the graph does not display please click here The issue is that the job market is totally unlike it was before the pandemic – for good and ill. One way to show this is what is known as the “Beveridge curve”, which tracks the unemployment rate with the job vacancy rate (vacancies as a percentage of the labour force): Since the pandemic the relationship between the two has shifted drastically away from the 40 years trend from 1980 through to 2019: If the graph does not display please click here In the past, the number of job vacancies we had in November would have been associated with an unemployment rate of somewhere well below 2%. But in November the unemployment rate was 4.6%. The reason is – as we are observing currently with groceries – one of demand and supply. The job vacancy number is the demand for labour, but the labour force number is the amount of supply. And since the pandemic, due to border restrictions our labour force has barely grown: If the graph does not display please click here There are around 365,000 fewer people in the labour force now than would have been expected before the pandemic. Added to that is the inability for people to move easily within Australia to new jobs and you have a case of increased demand for jobs because of the end of lockdowns but a lack of supply because of less immigration and inter-state migration. But we have not just had an increase in job vacancies because of a growth of work, but also because jobs previously held by migrants are now needed to be filled by someone else. In effect we have two prongs of demand while supply is lacking. And all of these figures come before the Omicron wave and the surge in cases and people being unable to work at the same time people are more hesitant to go out in public. So how is the economy going? In reality we don’t really know – nothing is as it usually is, nor as we can expect it to be in the future. Unfortunately, there is enough confusing data around for politicians to tell you they know how strong it is. And voters who are not paying attention might very well believe them.

1/13/2022,"Michaelia Cash’s department has defended religious schools’ right to sack teachers for their views on sexuality and appeared to confirm safeguards for gay students will be delayed until after the religious discrimination bill. The attorney general’s department’s submission to two inquiries states that changes to the Sex Discrimination Act will wait for a further review 12 months after the bill passes, despite a purported deal with four Liberal MPs to prevent expulsion of gay students at the same time, in exchange for their support of the religious discrimination bill.  Cash also personally walked back her reported commitment in December after a backlash from religious groups including the Australian Christian Lobby and Christian Schools Australia which threatened to scupper their support for the bill over the deal. Liberal MPs Katie Allen, Dave Sharma, Angie Bell and Fiona Martin claimed they had won Cash’s agreement to remove section 38(3) from the Sex Discrimination Act, which allows schools to discriminate on sexuality and gender grounds. The department’s submission reiterates that “the religious discrimination bill does not affect the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act”. “In particular, the existing exemptions for religious educational institutions provided in section 38 of that Act are not affected.” The department said religious exemptions will be considered by the Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry, to report back 12 months after the bill passes. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The department noted although the bill does not affect schools ability to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation it “would allow a religious school to consider a person’s religious beliefs about issues such as sexuality” where it is part of the beliefs of the school. In its submission, the Sydney Anglican church defended itself against the widely reported claims that teacher Stephanie Lentz had been sacked being gay. The submission, by the Reverend Dr Michael Stead, noted that in Lentz’s own words she was “fired … because of [her] belief that a person can be a Christian and be gay”. Lentz was sacked by a Christian school last year after coming out as gay in 2020. Her dismissal was legal under current exemptions to anti-discrimination laws for religious institutions. Stead argued Lentz was sacked because she was unable to sign the schools statement of belief, as a “celibate gay Christian” might be able to. “Correctly understood, the teacher’s sexuality is not the key issue in this case. “A heterosexual teacher who held the same theological views on sexuality and relationships, and therefore was unable to sign the statement of belief, would also have had his or her employment terminated.” Public Interest Advocacy Centre policy manager, Alastair Lawrie, said the submission demonstrated how religious groups “plan to discriminate against LGBT people, but call it something else”. This means that, unless an LGBT student is prepared to affirm that 'homosexuality is intrinsically disordered', or that 'god created only man and woman, therefore transgender people do not exist', the religious school will be free to discriminate against them under the Bill. 3/ The Sydney Anglican submission also defended the bill’s controversial statement of belief clause, arguing people should be able to express genuinely held religious beliefs, even if offensive to others including those in the congregation. Examples it cited included: “menstruating women are unclean”, “homosexuality is a sin”, “disability is caused by the devil”, “every child should have a mother and a father who are married”, “god made only men and women” and “HIV is a punishment from God”. Despite support from the Sydney Anglicans and the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, the bill faces oppositions from state governments – including Liberal governments in Tasmania and New South Wales – over provisions that override state law on hiring practices, and statements of belief. The Victorian government has complained the bill overrides reforms it passed in December, limiting schools’ ability to discriminate against staff to positions where religious belief is an inherent requirement. The Australian Council of Human Rights Authorities, consisting of the commissions that administer discrimination law in every state and territory, warned the bill undermines governments at that level’s ability “to craft anti-discrimination laws and balance rights in a manner appropriate to their jurisdictions”. “It would undermine efforts made at the state and territory level to narrow exceptions that allow religious bodies to discriminate against LGBTIQ people and women in employment.” With a group of three Liberal moderates withholding their support from the bill and the status of the deal with the other four unclear, Labor support will probably be needed to pass the bill before the 2022 election. Labor has reserved its position until the completion of two parliamentary inquiries, both due to report by 4 February. Labor’s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has said that people should be protected against discrimination on the ground of religion but “any extension of the federal anti-discrimination framework should not remove protections that already exist in the law to protect Australians from other forms of discrimination”.",News/Australia news,Attorney general defends religious schools’ right to sack teachers for views on sexuality ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/attorney-general-defends-religious-schools-right-to-sack-teachers-for-views-on-sexuality
1/13/2022,"Home care providers say critical care services, including nursing and medication needs, are being left to family members as they juggle limited staff numbers due to explosive growth in Covid case numbers. Labor says the federal government’s management of the aged care sector has been “diabolical”, with Covid outbreaks in at least 495 aged care homes nationally and a shortage of rapid antigen tests.  Integratedliving Australia, which has more than 20,000 clients in regional, rural and remote areas across the eastern seaboard, said about 8% of its in-home care workforce was either infected or in isolation as a result of Covid exposure – up from 6% the previous week. Most of its clients are on commonwealth home support programs but some have higher needs and utilise home care packages and NDIS programs. As some services are scaled back, family members are being asked to take over critical care duties to allow staff to be prioritised where needed. Integratedliving’s chief operating officer, Indra Arunachalam, said staffing issues were most acute in the Hunter Valley and Central Coast areas of NSW. “This is where we are cancelling some services and some of the strategies we’ve put in there is saying: ‘Although you normally receive two hours worth of services, can we just give you one hour with those services, this time?’” she said. “And we’re having the conversation with clients to delay domestic assistance because we need to divert staff to do the critical issues such as medication support, personal care, nursing, meals and things like that. “In other areas where we have had no staff we’ve basically worked with the client’s family to support the clients with those critical services.” Arunachalam said this meant that in some instances families were taking over nursing tasks and administering medical supplies so that limited staff could be directed to those with greater need. “We are concerned that we cannot sustain this level of effort and resourcing to keep our clients and staff safe,” Arunachalam said. The organisation has been unable to procure enough rapid antigen test kits to assist with staffing issues and – unlike the residential aged care sector – there is no priority access to commonwealth supplies for in-home care providers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Arunachalam said there needed to be a consistent national approach for the sector and available RATs to help manage the spike in Covid cases. “Given the PCR tests were made available free under Medicare for all Australians, the expectation was that the RATs would follow a similar sort of path,” she said. “It’s really frustrating that there’s been a lack of a consistent national approach that has actually been thought through, and not just for the aged care sector or the health care sector, but in all sectors, when we are all worried in the community.” Paul Sadler, from the peak body Aged and Community Services Australia, said providers were being forced to make difficult decisions as a result of worsening staff shortages. “There’s obviously the impact on the ability to provide the basic care that older people need. So are people able to be showered daily, do you have to reduce that? Are you able to meet their individual needs if you’re down that many staff?” he said. “We have aged care homes, we have home care services who are telling us they’ve lost anywhere between five and 30% of their staff. How you’re meant to maintain quality of care for older people when you have a third or more of your staff knocked out is anybody’s guess.” Federal Labor’s shadow minister for senior Australians, Claire O’Neil, said the aged care sector was already in a crisis before the Omicron wave hit. “Now we’ve got the pandemic and Omicron layered over the top and what providers are telling me is that the situation is genuinely diabolical,” she told ABC radio. “I’ve had providers tell me that they’ve been involved in aged care for 40 years and they’ve never seen a situation as bad as it is today, and other providers saying that they wouldn’t be surprised if providers actually left the sector and stopped providing services altogether. “There is an awareness right now that we’re not providing safe care to these frail and vulnerable people and providers don’t want to be in a position to do that.” On Tuesday, Guardian Australia reported that rapid antigen tests were “virtually impossible” for aged care providers to access, particularly for preventive screening, while the disability sector is also experiencing similar challenges. A spokesperson for the federal health department said the government was working closely with the sector to ensure they had Covid plans in place for all care recipients so they “can continue to receive the high priority services they need”. “The Australian government recognises the hard work of the in-home and community aged care sector throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and their continued efforts to provide necessary services to senior Australians to stay safely in their homes,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue to update guidance to providers to ensure they have access to the latest information so they can provide a safe environment for both care recipients and their staff.” The department said financial support had been provided, including grants to aid mandatory vaccination for the workforce and to cover any increased costs incurred due to a Covid-19 outbreak among staff and care recipients. “The government continues to adjust guidance and consider additional measures as circumstances change.” The spokesperson said rapid antigen tests had been prioritised for residential aged care but the government would continue “to assess the need for additional measures for high-risk groups in light of the current Omicron outbreak”.",News/Australia news,‘Genuinely diabolical’: in-home aged care struggling to meet critical needs under Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/genuinely-diabolical-in-home-aged-care-struggling-to-meet-critical-needs-under-omicron-surge
