1/11/2022,"A photograph of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and her boyfriend that circulated online led the congresswoman to quip about the “sexual frustrations” of her Republican colleagues. So naturally Fox News on Monday turned to Sarah Palin for her insight into the matter. “It amazes me though, [Ocasio-Cortez] and other liberals—socialists, even—their ability to deflect from what the issues truly are,” the former Alaska governor said, “and [to] hear her obsession [with]—or at least suggestion of—always gender, and sex even.” Ocasio-Cortez, in response to a tweet from former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes that criticized her boyfriend’s socks, had written: “If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet. Ya creepy weirdos.” She added: “It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women, & LGBT+ people in general.” That, Palin told Fox News host Rachel Campos-Duffy, was not a good look. “Look how the liberals, Rachel, want to pound that into the public’s head: advertising who is attracted to who. What people do in… the privacy of their own bedrooms,” the dismayed former vice presidential nominee said. “All those things that have to do with privacy and sex—the liberals, not the conservatives, are the ones who pound, pound, pound after that. And obviously it’s a tactic so that she doesn’t have to be held accountable.” What Ocasio-Cortez is avoiding accountability for, Palin didn’t specify, but Republicans had jumped on the opportunity to portray a maskless Ocasio-Cortez eating outside in Miami as somehow being hypocritical about her COVID stance. Florida has no mask mandate, and CDC guidelines state that masks should be worn in indoor spaces with high transmission rates. Ocasio-Cortez tested positive for COVID on Sunday, she announced on Twitter. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

1/11/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel    NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government is prepared to dismiss two perjury charges against Ghislaine Maxwell if her conviction for aiding Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuses is allowed to stand, according to a joint letter from prosecutors and Maxwell's defense team.    In the Monday night letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, prosecutors said dismissing the perjury counts would reflect the victims' ""significant interests in bringing closure to this matter and avoiding the trauma of testifying again.""    Prosecutors also asked the Manhattan judge to sentence Maxwell in about three to four months.    Lawyers for Maxwell oppose setting any timetable, believing that one juror's post-trial revelations about having been sexually abused was a ""compelling basis"" to overturn their client's conviction and grant a new trial, the letter said.    Maxwell, 60, was convicted on Dec. 29 after a month-long trial on sex trafficking and other charges of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.    Lawyers for the British socialite challenged the conviction after one juror told Reuters that when some jurors expressed skepticism about the accounts of two Maxwell accusers, he shared his experience of having been sexually abused as a child.    That juror's disclosures to Reuters and other media ""influenced the deliberations and convinced other members of the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell,"" Maxwell's lawyers have said.    Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison on her conviction.    The perjury charges concern allegations that Maxwell lied about her knowledge of Epstein's behavior during depositions taken in 2016 for a separate civil lawsuit.    Each charge carries a maximum five-year prison term. Nathan decided last April to try them in a separate trial.    Nathan gave Maxwell's lawyers until Jan. 19 to formally explain why the conviction should be overturned. Prosecutors have until Feb. 2 to respond.    Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, killed himself in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting his own sex trafficking trial.    (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Michael Perry) ",World/Reuters,U.S. offers to dismiss Ghislaine Maxwell perjury case if sex abuse conviction stands,https://news.yahoo.com/u-offers-dismiss-ghislaine-maxwell-024336648.html
