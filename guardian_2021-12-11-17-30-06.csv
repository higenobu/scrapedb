12/11/2021,"Gregg Wallace, Gregg Wallace, Gregg Wallace. I have to be up front and say: I love the man. There are lots of celebrities I enjoy playing a hypothetical game with where I explain who they are and why they are famous in Britain to someone from another country, and Gregg Wallace is one of my favourite plays. “Well he’s a greengrocer, basically,” I explain to someone from America or something, where they have dazzlingly glossy celebrities and where Gregg Wallace doesn’t even make an alien sort of sense. “Well, he was. Then he hosted a MasterChef reboot – nobody knows where he came from or why they chose him for that, because he often treats gourmet food as if it’s someone he’s shouting at through a car window – and now he’s sort of a national treasure, I guess. He lost a significant amount of weight and now he poses topless a lot on Instagram.” The American is looking baffled now. “You’re not getting it, he goes to factories! He met his wife on Twitter!” They are backing away now, saying something about having to get home to their hamburger, or a small child called Chad. “You don’t understand! Gregg Wallace has an irresistibly kissable head! He is one of Britain’s best celebrities!”  It’s best not to focus on the Gregg Wallaceness of Gregg Wallace, is what I’m saying. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride, which is exactly what I did while watching Gregg Wallace’s Grand Christmas Adventure (Saturday, 8.25pm), where Channel 5 sent Gregg Wallace to Lapland for two days and said: “Have fun.” The wide-angle lens of this one is: Gregg Wallace will host a travelogue show in one of the most magical places on Earth, and he’ll turn the footage round in one weekend flat. But look closer and you’ll see it is one of the oddest TV shows of the year, and all the better for it. The first thing is: I don’t think anyone told Gregg Wallace who this was for, or what it’s about. On the surface he goes to Finland, attends a few touristy grotto-style events, eats some yuletide bakes, goes on a sledge, etc etc etc. But occasionally he goes quite odd and turns to the camera and tells me exactly how much the experience he is currently experiencing costs, and suddenly the merry Christmas show feels like when you can’t figure out how to stop the television in your hotel room from playing on a loop. It’s neat I mention hotels, actually, because Gregg gives us an exhaustive tour of the one he’s staying in, perching awkwardly on the edge of his bed with his shoes still on and explaining how, because of the size of the window, you wouldn’t want to sleep naked in here. All right, cheers then Gregg, I won’t. He pops round the corner into a cosy balcony room with a wood fire, sags on a chair, and says: “It’s not cheap.” OK? Next: I know at certain angles Gregg Wallace looks like a baby who somehow got a Millwall tattoo, but he is 57 years old, which makes it odd that he seems to be on a family holiday targeted quite directly at children, alone. Gregg goes around a toy factory (can’t help himself, can he?) after hours and laughs as he fills a toy horse with stuffing. He makes a traditional Christmas goat out of straw and gets pulled by a reindeer, alone, through some woods. The best moments are when Gregg does adult activities – he goes to an ice bar and does a shot of some herby liqueur, and enjoys a woodsy day of fishing and camping with a tour guide who later invites him for a beer in his sauna. But then he goes and meets Santa and hands him a little girl’s wishlist he found and was particularly moved by. Occasionally you’re like: this is classic background TV, I can leave it on while I do other stuff. And then, in a flash, perspective moves and you see Gregg Wallace is on a children’s holiday, alone – one of the most harrowing concepts for a television hour I’ve come across.Weirdly, I loved every second of it. There is no TV show that made me giggle out loud more this year, and the undercurrent of weirdness – though unintentional – is absolutely what makes it. There is a moment when Gregg Wallace fistbumps Santa Claus. They have cracked the code, TV producers, and figured out this one central truth: whenever Gregg Wallace is having fun on TV, viewers will have fun, too. Your “American celebrities” can’t get near him.",Arts/Television & radio,Gregg Wallace’s Grand Christmas Adventure: one of the year’s oddest TV shows,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/11/gregg-wallaces-grand-christmas-adventure-one-of-the-years-oddest-tv-shows
12/11/2021,"When Karen Elson was a young hopeful trying to make it in Paris, a model scout took her to a nightclub. After long days on the Métro trekking to castings that came to nothing, and evenings alone in a run-down apartment, she was excited to be out having fun. The music was good and the scout, to whom her agent had introduced her, kept the drinks coming. She started to feel tipsy. A friend of the scout’s arrived, and the pair started massaging her shoulders, making sexual suggestions. “I was 16 and I’d never kissed a boy,” she recalls. “It was my first experience of sexual – well, sexual anything, and this was sexual harassment. They both had their hands on me.” She told them she wanted to go home, and left to find a taxi, but they followed her into it, kissing her neck on the back seat. When they reached her street, she jumped out, slammed the taxi door and ran inside. The next day she told another model what had happened, and the scout found out. “His reaction was to corner me in the model agency and say: ‘I’ll fucking get you kicked out of Paris if you ever fucking say anything ever again.’”  Twenty-six years later, Elson is telling me this story from her sixth-floor suite in the Ritz hotel in London. The scout did not get her kicked out of Paris. She got booked for a shoot in Tokyo by an up-and-coming young American designer called Marc Jacobs, then Donatella Versace hired her as a fitting model to help her fine-tune her clothing. On Elson’s 18th birthday, Steven Meisel photographed her for the cover of Italian Vogue, her strawberry blond hair chopped into a Louise Brooks bob and tinted crimson, her pale skin exaggerated to alabaster, and a career as a supermodel began. Karl Lagerfeld called her “the beauty of the new millennium” and she is still going strong. At Paris fashion week this autumn, she walked in the Balmain show between Milla Jovovich and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy; in Milan, she was on stage alongside Kate Moss and Gigi Hadid for a collaboration between Italian powerhouses Fendi and Versace. Today, the trappings of success are all around. A vast bouquet sits in its cellophane, a plate of fanned sliced fruit is untouched on the desk. But Elson takes a sip from a bone china teacup and tells me that the legacy of her 25 years at the top of the modelling game is “a shit ton of PTSD”. Her distinctive Elizabethan colouring is still radiant against black cashmere, her complexion still peachy and wrinkle-free (more of which later), but her verdict on fashion lands with a punch. “Modelling looks like it’s all glamour, and it really is not,” she says. “I survived sexual harassment, body shaming and bullying. And I am supposedly one of the lucky ones.” Not long after that night in Paris, Elson was living in Milan, signed to “an agency run by women who gave it to me straight: ‘Do not go to clubs, because the men who take models to clubs are sleazy and you will be in danger.’” Some of the girls in Elson’s apartment were not so lucky. “I remember one waking up with bruises on her neck. We were all horrified. They were young models, full of hopes and dreams, and the people who were supposed to be their guardians were preying on them. The agents had prestige names on their books, girls who were in Vogue and getting big campaigns, but they also had young models they went to nightclubs with.” Models who are earning little money are given free drinks in clubs, sometimes taken to fancy restaurants, in return for being arm candy. “Sometimes there is a fine line between modelling and escort work, and the girls don’t realise it. I’m not shaming them for that.” Last year, a Guardian investigation by Lucy Osborne revealed decades of alleged abuse by former Elite Models boss Gérald Marie. This summer, the model Carré Otis filed a suit against Marie – who denies all allegations against him – for rape and sex trafficking, abuse she claims began when she was 17. Elson, who has led calls to reform the model agency system, booking most of her own shoots for the past four years, immediately offered her support. “We need to figure out why the fashion industry enables so much toxicity and [we need to] finally make positive changes,” she wrote on Instagram. For a time, Elson was also represented by Marie. “My impression was he was a sleazy man,” she says, speaking publicly about him for the first time. “But I never had anything happen with him. To be blunt, I don’t think I was … well, that I was a bit odd-looking and ginger granted me some protection. Not always, but sometimes.” Elson has seen how a toxic blend of international travel, lack of transparency and an unequal power structure can shade modelling into trafficking. In March, she began running “model mentor” workshops online, giving advice to young people in the industry. A young eastern European woman at one session told Elson her passport had been confiscated when she tried to leave an agency. “I was like: withholding your passport, that’s human trafficking. And her agency was also telling her she’d get kicked out of the country if she left.” In 2001, the Victoria’s Secret televised lingerie show was in its pomp, with 12 million viewers tuning in. Rupert Everett was the host; Mary J Blige performed that year’s inescapable hit, Family Affair. It was a high-profile, lucrative job, but Elson recalls “walking out and seeing a bunch of lecherous men in the audience. I could smell the misogyny. I didn’t feel beautiful, I felt ridiculous. I felt like someone else’s fantasy of a redhead, in a red G-string and devil horns, or whatever the fuck I was wearing.” Later, I look up the pictures. Elson is in a red G-string and corset, though no devil horns. Most of the other models toss their ringlets and flash toothy grins; Elson, half hidden under long straight hair, looks stone-faced. “I felt sad the whole time I was doing it,” she says. Elson has never been a cookie-cutter beauty queen. Growing up in Oldham, “with frizzy red hair and ghost-white skin and no boobs” at a time when every teenage boy she knew had a poster of Cindy Crawford on his wall, she kept her early modelling ambitions quiet. After signing to Boss Models in Manchester, she left school early every Thursday to go there, claiming she was off to see the orthodontist. The day after she finished her GCSEs in June 1995, she caught the train to London, dragging her suitcase straight to the office of Models 1. Photographer Tim Walker’s Vogue portraits of Elson have featured her in bed with a giant crocodile, or in white tuxedo trousers with braces and no blouse. He met Elson and fellow model Erin O’Connor for the first time in 1997 and thought they didn’t look like models: “They looked like people I knew, art college friends.” With her marble skin, flaming hair and fine bone structure, Elson can look “androgynous and ethereal, so I wasn’t so much the sexualised object,” she says. But being pigeonholed as otherworldly came with its own issues. “I was put in this box where I was a freak, and as a result it was as if I wasn’t real. I wasn’t supposed to have feelings.” Having reached the supermodel ranks, she experienced a kind of impostor syndrome. “I just wanted so badly to fit in. I wanted to be Claudia Schiffer and instead I felt like the red-headed stepchild.” Despite Elson’s slender frame, through much of her career she has been bullied over her weight by people in the industry. A well-known Italian designer once described her, to her face, as “a beast” and “disgusting”. A US model agent offered to pay her money for every pound she could lose. Once, in desperation to get work, she booked into a “health spa” in California where she fasted for seven days. She flew straight to Milan for fashion week (“looking skeletal”) and the compliments – and bookings – flooded in. Just before our interview, Elson texts to say she is about to order room service, asking if I want anything. When her lunch arrives, she ignores the food, saying she feels too self-conscious to eat during the interview. (It is under a silver dome, but I think it’s a salad.) Clumsily, I comment on her “self-control”, to which she replies with a wry smile that “self-control is my achilles heel”. Eating disorders have plagued her since she was seven when, unsettled by her parents’ increasingly unhappy marriage, she stopped eating and was admitted to hospital. “Food has always been attached to trauma for me,” she says. “And then I went into an industry that played into my biggest insecurities.” With the help of “a great therapist, who used to be a ballerina and understands body dysmorphia”, Elson has reached a “safety zone”. “I sincerely do eat these days. I will never do another diet as long as I live because they make me feel like I’m losing my mind, but if I’m on set and a dress doesn’t fit, it’s really hard not to go to that place where you start thinking, if I was 12lb skinnier … I’m not going to do anything drastic any more, but the thoughts still appear. I run really fast four times a week and, yes, I love it mentally, but I also love how it makes me look, and it’s important to be candid about that. It’s a rollercoaster for me still.” Her therapist would like her to give up modelling, she says. Behind the lip service to diversity, fashion’s obsession with thinness persists. “I looked at photos from a catwalk show recently and the models were so, so thin. Not the kind of thin you get by going for a healthy jog in the morning – the kind you get when you stop eating. I find it heartbreaking to see that still.” Recently, someone in the industry greeted her with: “You’ve lost so much weight in your face, you look great!” she recalls. “I said to him, ‘You know, “Hello, how are you?” would be nicer.’” But there have been good times, too. She danced for Alexander McQueen’s landmark Deliverance show in 2004 and this year starred in a mini-musical for Moschino. When she feels a connection with a photographer on set, being a model is like being “lightning in a bottle”, she says. In her memoir The Red Flame: a Journey of a Woman, she writes about her breakthrough shoot with Meisel. “We shot for two glorious hours. I had never felt more excited. I left the studio to go back into the snow with only a single subway token, but I had never felt so joyful.” But while her unique looks caught the eye of the most creative photographers, being stereotyped as edgy often meant being expected to take her clothes off. “I would suddenly be given a see-through dress, or a pair of knickers and no top, and told: ‘That’s the image.’ My opinion didn’t come into it,” Elson says. Sometimes the results were poetic, beautiful images of which she is proud – her memoir includes nude portraits by Walker, Peter Lindbergh, Mert and Marcus – but there are other images she dislikes because she felt uncomfortable on set. These days, she has learned to set out boundaries. “If someone wants to take a nude, they have to explain the context, why it’s necessary and how they intend to ensure I feel safe and comfortable.” She laughs. “Funnily enough, no one ever asks me to be nude any more.” Because our society struggles to distinguish what a woman looks like from who a woman is, models have become ciphers for femininity. Debate about them is charged because it is never just about models, but about the institutionalised misogyny of a world where the female experience can feel like a never-ending beauty contest in which even the winners are shortchanged. “Power is so elusive as a model. Even as a supermodel, it doesn’t feel like you really own your power,” Elson says. Her words remind me of a point made by Emily Ratajkowski in her essay collection My Body – that exploitation is inevitable in “a value system that revolves around men and their desire”. Elson is encouraged “by Emily taking control of her own voice, the way other people have taken control of her image”. Yet when she describes Ratajkowski in person, Elson’s articulate, crisp sentences dissolve into breathlessness. She was “blown by how beautiful, how ridiculously beautiful, she is. It’s like … how is your stomach so flat? How is that even possible? Everything about her is just … And God Created Woman, you know?” Everyone, it seems, is conditioned to objectify Ratajkowski-level beauty, even supermodels campaigning against objectification. There is a fractiousness in the conversation around models that model and labour activist Sara Ziff, founder of the Model Alliance, has termed the “empathy gap”. Ziff argues that the job’s ultra-glamorous image does a disservice to most models by giving the impression that anyone with their picture in a magazine is flying first class with suitcases stuffed with cash. “The biggest misconception about modelling is the money,” Elson says. “Most working models are barely getting by.” Elson’s father was a joiner in construction; her mother stayed at home, occasionally taking odd jobs to make ends meet. Elson and her twin sister, Kate, shared a bed held up by tin cans. She has rarely known the luxury of not worrying about money. Because her off-kilter looks tended to appeal more to editorial clients than to commercial ones, her income has been erratic. “I’d get home from a shoot and once all the expenses were added up, I’d be in debt.” For a prestigious magazine, a 20-hour shoot might pay a flat fee of only £150, “and if you’re flying yourself somewhere, the debts can rack up”. A lack of financial transparency is symptomatic of the way models “are made into powerless, passive entities in their own industry, rather than treated as professionals”, she says. “The agents’ attitude was always – you’re just a pretty face, get out there and milk it until the wrinkles arrive, then you’ll be carted back to your home town.” Elson says she would ask an agent how much she’d be paid for a job and “practically hear the eye roll over the phone – here she goes again, being difficult”. Now she is represented by a talent agent and a publicist: “I’m never signing with another model agency as long as I live.” In 2005, Elson, ghostly in white tulle and teetering on her heels, starred in a music video for Blue Orchid by the White Stripes. Within a few weeks, she and frontman Jack White had eloped to the Amazon rainforest where they were married by a shaman. They divorced in 2013. Her memoir makes no mention of the restraining order she took out against him that year, saying only that “eventually the dust settled” and the two are now “loving co-parents” to their children Scarlett, 15, and Henry, 14. Having long harboured musical ambitions, Elson released her first album as a singer-songwriter, The Ghost Who Walks, in 2010, followed by Double Roses seven years later. Her music – a gothic kind of blues, part folksy Americana, part Left Bank chanteuse – has won over sceptics of the “model marries rock star, makes record” narrative. (“Ethereal pop majesty with a mesmerising talent,” wrote this paper in 2017.) An EP of covers recorded during lockdown, Radio Redhead, will be followed next year by a third album, Green. Yet music, Elson has discovered, can be as misogynistic as fashion. “In fashion, the misogyny is more superficial – the men don’t necessarily want to sleep with me, they want to objectify me in a picture. In music there are still powerful straight white men who operate under the myth of the tortured genius. There have been men who said they believed in my talent and then it turned out they wanted to sleep with me. It was humiliating.” We are living in the era of supermodel reparations. Paulina Porizkova and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy have joined Elson in offering support to Carré Otis. Linda Evangelista, who has posted about being “permanently deformed” by complications after a cosmetic procedure on her face, is “a good friend. It is so difficult to be a supermodel getting older and have what you looked like 20 years ago held up as a comparison the whole time. I’ve had two kids, and to walk on set and be given an outfit that would work on a 17-year-old is hard.” Evangelista speaking out “is really brave because it goes against decades of conditioning to be the beautiful face and stay silent”. At 42, Elson’s own face is wrinkle-free. “I have had Botox, and I like it,” she says. “I haven’t done filler yet, but I probably will.” She kneads her sculpted cheekbones with manicured nails, miming an imaginary lift. She’d love to champion natural beauty, she says, but she isn’t going to pretend she’s not “feeling the pressure. Let’s just talk about it, you know? The cloak-and-dagger around Botox isn’t helpful, because not admitting to it perpetuates images that aren’t realistic.” Elson’s next appointment has arrived – a film crew, pacing the corridor outside – and she still hasn’t had a chance to eat her salad. She promises she will call to say goodbye properly, and a few days later is on the phone from Nashville, Tennessee. The city is home, she says, because, years ago, “my husband Jack and I fell in love with Nashville and bought a house here, kind of impulsively. Two kids later, I looked around and I was like – huh, I guess I live in this town now,” she laughs. “Having kids taught me boundaries, and Nashville gave me an escape from fashion. The realness to life here is such a blessing.” To her kids and her neighbours, she isn’t a supermodel; she is “a dorky British woman, sitting here on my bed with a cup of tea, my big tom cat Fergus on my lap.” She has come a long way from Paris, in every sense. “You know what’s really messed up about fashion? The moments when I was totally exhausted and fragile were when people loved me most. It was like, she’s major! But at the expense of my health and my sanity. And I got to a point where I thought, I’m a grown fucking woman, you know? I’ve got two kids. I’m a good mother. I don’t want to be a broken doll any more.”  In March, Elson will appear in a Sky Documentaries series, telling the story of sexual exploitation in the modelling industry. Building on an investigation by journalist Lucy Osborne, first published in the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, it will be produced by Wonderhood Studios and the Guardian.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Supermodel Karen Elson on fashion’s toxic truth: ‘I survived harassment, body shaming and bullying – and I’m one of the lucky ones’ ",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/11/supermodel-karen-elson-on-fashions-toxic-truth-i-survived-harassment-body-shaming-and-bullying-and-im-one-of-the-lucky-ones
12/11/2021,"Ihave determinedly avoided writing about neck creams for many years, but the huge fashion trend for “neck mess” (wearing lots of necklaces all together) has forced me to confront the issue. Neck mess is the new proclivity of social media users – and celebrities such as Michelle Obama and Gwyneth Paltrow – towards wearing multiple necklaces of varied thicknesses and lengths, suspending an eclectic collection of mismatching pendants, lockets and fobs, making the neck the focal point of a look (it’s no coincidence the trend was born at the height of Zoom-meeting dependency). Writer Nora Ephron’s decision to start hiding her neck with cowl necks and polos at just 43 (“Our faces are lies and our necks are the truth”) seems much less fun, but I know from your emails that there is anxiety around loosening and wrinkling neck skin.  I have never recommended neck creams here because I think they’re nonsense. They’re expensive and cannot magically hoik up a sagging neck. Nothing but surgery can do that. In principle, the skin on your neck no more needs its own cream than molars need a different toothpaste from incisors. It’s easier to drape on another necklace to either camouflage or adorn. What works below the jaw is the same as what works above, via your regular facial skincare: antioxidants and sunscreen for protection, hyaluronic acid for hydration, oil for moisture and retinoids to at least partially reverse damage. Where this becomes tricky is that necks are prone to sensitivity, specifically with retinoids like retinol and tretinoin, which can leave them red and sore. The answer is to buffer the neck from too strong a product, effectively by reversing the application of layers, smoothing first a bland, gentle moisturiser (Avène Hydrance Rich Hydrating cream moisturiser, £15.50, La Roche Posay’s Toleriane Sensitive Fluide Moisturiser, £16.50 or Dr Jart Ceramidin cream, £30, perhaps) all over the neck, before applying retinol on top. Think of the cream as a mattress topper for your neck, to shield what lies beneath while letting enough through to do something. I do precisely this myself every night, as well as exercising my neck muscles regularly (they get much less of a workout than our expressive faces). By reappropriating the advice given by my midwife about my pelvic floor, I remember to make a point of tensing my neck muscles by flexing my jaw whenever I send a text message. It’s handy advice, if somewhat unbecoming on the bus.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Neck creams are nonsense – but this sensitive area does need a bit of love | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/11/neck-creams-are-nonsense-sensitive-area-needs-a-bit-of-love
12/11/2021,"“When you see them in the wild, there’s this tangible feeling of humility and respect,” says Tom Gibbs, one of the UK’s first two bison rangers. “The size of them instantly demands your respect, although they are quite docile. I wouldn’t say they are scary, but you’re aware of what they can do.” The rangers will manage the first wild bison to roam in the UK for thousands of years when four animals arrive in north Kent in the spring of 2022. The bison are Europe’s largest land animal – bulls can weigh a tonne – and were extinct in the wild a century ago, but are recovering through reintroduction projects across Europe.  “They are magnificent animals, truly gentle giants,” says colleague Donovan Wright, who spent 20 years working with rhino, cape buffalo and other large animals in southern Africa. “The Kent project is very different, but it’s no less important.” Wright says: “How amazing will it be to track the largest land mammal in the UK on foot right here in [Kent]? To experience something like this only five miles from Canterbury would be just incredible, and help people reconnect with nature.” Gibbs and Wright have just returned from training with wild bison herds in the Netherlands, where they were reintroduced in 2007. The £1m Kent project is called Wilder Blean and is run by the Kent Wildlife Trust and the Wildwood Trust, and funded by the People’s Postcode Lottery. A principal aim is for the bison to rewild a dense, former commercial pine forest. “What makes bison a keystone species is that they strip bark off of trees by rubbing up against them, and by eating it,” says Wright. “Those trees die and that allows light to reach the forest floors. And, wow, that’s like jet fuel for biodiversity – all of a sudden, you’re creating habitats for other species to thrive. “Also, just by their sheer size, they carve amazing trails through the vegetation, and they love dust bathing, creating big open patches. That’s all fantastic for pioneer plants, insects and sand lizards.” The insects living on the dead wood left behind are amazing for woodpeckers and bats too, Wright says. The rangers visited the Kraansvlak project in the Netherlands, where people can walk freely through the area occupied by 14 bison and where there has never been a dangerous incident. But part of the training was learning the animals’ behaviour to ensure safety. “You read the animals, so if they’re giving you signs that they’re not really comfortable with your presence, you just back away,” says Gibbs. The signs include staring, alert ears, heads flicking up and down, pawing of the ground, or the herd fanning out. “In reality, the bison are the ones who maintain the [50 metre safety] distance, by moving away.” Like the bison in Kraansvlak, the animals in Kent will wear GPS collars, but these can get damaged and so tracking skills are needed to ensure the rangers can find the animals without startling them. Broken twigs and tufts of fur on branches are clues, as well as hoofprints in softer ground. The rangers also learned how to encourage the bison into a corral for quick health checks. “There are a few tricks of the trade, such as certain foodstuffs,” says Gibbs, but these are kept secret to avoid the public trying to attract the bison unnecessarily. It took five years before the Kraansvlak rangers were confident the public could enter the bison area alone, but Wright is not setting a timescale for the Kent project. “We are treading very carefully,” he says. The Kent herd will be founded by a young bull from Germany and an older female from the Highland wildlife park in Scotland, who will be the matriarch. “She looks beautiful and we’re really confident that she’s going to be a fantastic leader for the group,” says Gibbs. Two young females from Fota wildlife park in Cork, Ireland, will complete the group, which will roam and feed freely across 210 hectares (519 acres). The rangers expect the bison to breed – females produce one calf a year – and the site is licensed for up to 10 animals. In future, they hope to provide bison to found other sites in the UK, as well as exchanging animals across Europe. All 7,000 bison living in Europe are descended from just 12 zoo animals, and the species is still classed as vulnerable, so maximising genetic diversity is very important. Preparations are now under way at Wilder Blean for the arrival of the bison. “We’re putting up a 1.4-metre electric fence to contain the bison and then, on the perimeter, we’ve got a 6ft deer fence to keep the people out,” says Wright. Ponds are also being dug for the bison to drink from, as well as the longhorn cattle, Exmoor ponies and “iron age” pigs that will help restore the landscape. Wright says: “We had another interesting dilemma: how do you get a herd of bison safely over a public footpath [that crosses the site]? The answer was bison-sized tunnels, so we are working on that at the moment.” The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and the rangers hope the bison project will be a beacon for a wider recovery. “By using nature-based solutions, we can really turn the tide and help mitigate the effects of the current climate and biodiversity crises that we face,” says Wright. “A lot of people feel frustrated about a lack of action but I think this project is a real beacon of what can be done,” says Gibbs. “We can’t wait for the bison to arrive and for them to start doing what they do best.”",News/Environment,‘Gentle giants’: rangers prepare for return of wild bison to UK,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/11/gentle-giants-rangers-prepare-return-wild-bison-uk
12/11/2021,"A south London man has described his incredulity after Merton council ordered him to remove his solar panels – flying in the face of attempts to tackle the climate crisis and in spite of the fact his neighbour has had some on their roof for more than 10 years. In 2019, Merton council declared a climate emergency and said the borough would become net zero by 2050. But that hasn’t stopped council officials ordering Syd Reid, who lives in Wimbledon, remove his panels because his property is in a conservation area.  A year ago he put up photovoltaic panels on his south-facing roof at the front of his home in an effort to reduce the property’s carbon footprint without realising he needed planning permission to do so. He had been assured, wrongly, by the installer that he didn’t. “I did a cursory investigation but somehow missed the conservation area rules,” he said. “The main reason I thought I would be fine was that our immediate neighbour has had almost identical south-facing solar panels on their roof for more than 10 years. “What’s happened since has been something out of the dark ages. Someone has complained and the council has ordered them to be taken down. It’s as if the climate crisis isn’t happening.” In 2008, the government removed the need for most people to get planning permission to install photovoltaic solar energy systems but the requirement for permission was retained in conservation areas and for all listed buildings. After Reid received an order from Merton’s planning department instructing him to take the panels down, he submitted an application for retrospective planning, only for this to be rejected. He said he appealed against that decision but this, too, has been turned down. He said the decision is all the more baffling given that the road that he lives on features a mixture of house styles and roof types. Not even the road’s greatest fan would describe it in any way as architecturally extraordinary, or important. “While the panels have been up I have reduced my carbon emissions by over 400kg,” he said. “The whole thing is madness – a combination of nimbyism and inconsistent, out-of-date planning bureaucracy that is failing to recognise the state [in which] we are leaving the planet. This has to be changed. “Our neighbour’s panels have been producing electricity for 10 years without upsetting anyone but mine have to come down. If I wish to maintain my level of carbon emissions reduction I have been advised that the only course of action left is to take my case to the high court.” A spokesperson for Merton council told Guardian Money that while installing solar panels is “generally to be applauded”, the council also has a duty to protect the “character” of the local area. “The standards of design that have to be met will always be higher in conservation areas,” he said. He said two other houses in the road have approved solar panels but on north-facing roofs, rather missing the point that they will produce significantly less power than they would on a south-facing roof. “We don’t want to put residents off installing carbon saving measures,” the spokesperson said. “Our planning officers are here to work with them to achieve developments that are compliant with our planning policy. There are other options which might have less of a visual impact, such as low-profile PVs or the use of solar tiles.” Meanwhile, it now looks likely that Reid’s neighbour could be forced to remove their panels, too. “We have not looked into this yet as no formal complaint was raised. However, our officers will now look to inspect and regularise those solar panels,” the Merton spokesperson said.",Lifestyle/Money,Homeowner told to remove solar panels – but next door has had them for decade,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/11/homeowner-told-to-remove-solar-panels-but-next-door-has-had-them-for-decade
12/11/2021,"I’m known as the feminist barrister. I represent women with no immigration status on the breadline and I represent politicians in positions of power. They all have one thing in common. They are survivors of male violence. Kate Griffiths MP is no exception.I had the great privilege of being her barrister. I remember meeting her in the Houses of Parliament for the first time. She had such stature. She was poised and had an air of confidence. We walked into a small room and it was there that I learned what her ex-husband Andrew Griffiths, a disgraced former MP, had done to his wife behind closed doors.  When he was a minister under Theresa May MP, he was also raping his wife whilst she was asleep. Sex whilst asleep is rape. But the abuse didn’t stop there. He put his hands around her neck, hit her and was physically abusive to her when she was nine months pregnant. He even shouted “shut the fuck up” to their new born baby. He continued his insidious coercive control of her even after they separated.We already knew he had a reputation for sexual depravity towards women. In 2013, Andrew Griffiths was reported to the police for harassment by his former partner whom he cheated on. In 2018, just weeks after Kate had just given birth, he sent over 2,000 sexual and violent messages in just a matter of days to two female constituents.His darker texts included “She’s so cute. So sweet. I can’t wait to beat her”. Whilst he supported making upskirting a criminal offence in parliament, he was sexting women, “I want to be able to lift your skirts over dinner and show my friends”. The Tory government suspended him – only to bring him back for Theresa May MP’s “confidence vote”. Then he was cleared of any wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog. The big red neon warning signs were ablaze for everyone to see. But those in the most senior positions of power turned a blind eye.In 2019, Kate bravely stood against Andrew Griffiths in the election as an MP in Burton upon Trent and she won. Little did anyone know that Derby family court was making decisions about one of the biggest cases of our time. Kate wanted to protect her child from further harm at the hands of Andrew. She could only do this by proving that he abused her and the child. She went through a traumatising trial.Watching her being cross-examined was painful . “You’re lying”, “why didn’t you leave?”, “why didn’t you tell anyone?”, was the line of questioning. Because, Kate responded, he told me that no one would believe me because he’s an MP. He used his position of power as a minister and MP to rape and abuse his wife with absolute impunity. He tried to silence her.Thousands of victims of domestic abuse will know from first-hand experience that almost everything that happens in the family courts is secret. I have long campaigned that we need to expose the truth. We need transparency. In this case, two journalists, Louise Tickle and Brian Farmer, applied to publish the judgments. Unlike all the other women that I represent, Kate had a platform to expose the truth. But Andrew, who denied allegations made by Kate and “adamantly denied” rape, fought bitterly against publishing the judgments. He was trying to further control her. But it didn’t work. Mrs Justice Lieven said, “the court should be slow in all cases to be used as a means by which one parent seeks further control over the other. Particularly where there have already been findings of coercive control”. We were vindicated. This case is not over. Andrew Griffiths is still allowed to havesupervised contact with their child. And if that isn’t awful enough, she has to pay half of the costs of supervised contact. This is financial control – both sickening and perverse. I appealed against the decision on behalf of Kate. We are waiting for the judgment.Imagine, you are teenager and you discover that your father raped your mother and then the family court required your mother to make you available for contact with him. Surely that is state-sanctioned abuse.The Ministry of Justice found last year that the family courts take a “pro-contact” at all costs approach even in cases of domestic abuse. This case shows that the government needs to urgently change the law. We need a presumption of no contact for abusive parents. But what this case shows most powerfully is how men in positions of power can still use their status to silence and control victims. Haven’t we learnt anything from the MeToo movement? It shows that even an MP, a public figure, a lawmaker, can be coercively controlling of their spouse and of other women. We have seen so many of these cases. It can happen to anyone. Powerful men who abuse need to be held accountable because victims will only have faith in the family justice system if they see that perpetrators are being held accountable and children are being protected. Victims in the family courts must not be silenced, for they have a right to self-identification and self-determination. If we want to change the system together, we must be able to speak the unspeakable.",News/Society,It was right to expose Andrew Griffiths as an abuser; powerful men must be accountable ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2021/dec/11/it-was-right-to-expose-andrew-griffiths-as-an-abuser-powerful-men-must-be-accountable
12/11/2021,"For almost a century, Kuttiyamma’s daily routine had been much the same. Rising early at home in the village of Thiruvanchoor in Kerala, the 104-year-old would begin her day’s work of cooking, cleaning and feeding the cows and chickens. But now, every morning, there’s something new to get up for. She eagerly awaits the paperboy to deliver Malayala Manorama, the local newspaper.  For two hours, she buries herself reading the news and keeping herself informed about what’s going on in the world. But it is only in recent months that she has been able to fulfil this dream of hers – in April, Kuttiyamma finally began to learn to read. “I was always curious about what was happening around the world,” she said. “On many occasions I regretted my inability to read newspapers and I used to plead with the younger generations at home to read out newspapers to me. I always wanted to write my name and address.” After months of evening classes, she decided to take the Kerala state primary literacy exam last month, the oldest woman to do so. She achieved 89% in literacy and 100% in mathematics. It was a result that drew praise from the state education minister, who tweeted: “Age is no barrier for knowledge. With utmost respect and love, I wish Kuttiyamma and all other new learners the best.” For most of her 104 years, Kuttiyama had been curious about reading and would often try to make out the alphabet herself, but when she was born, in a village to a low-caste rural family, there was no education. “I hailed from Kerala’s backward Ezhava community and was born in the midst of poverty,” said Kuttiyamma, while pottering about in the kitchen. “Education for women family members was unthinkable at that time. Even boys discontinued their studies at nine. My parents were landless agricultural labourers and it was my duty to cook food, wash dresses and keep the hut for my 11 siblings.” And so, she got on with her life. At 16, she married TK Konthi, who sold herbal medicines in a small shop, and they had five children. Decades passed, filled with cooking and housework, and Kuttiyama says she was content but always felt something was missing. It was only with the encouragement a year ago of her neighbour Rehana John, a 34-year-old literacy trainer, that Kuttiyamma was persuaded to start to learn to read. John had noticed Kuttiayama’s curiosity about her grandchildren’s learning and offered to give her some books. Previously, John’s oldest student had been 85. After some gentle encouragement, they began meeting every evening, poring over literacy books together. “Except for very little vision and hearing problems, she was a perfect and sometimes naughty student who made my teaching feel meaningful,” said John. “She always has her textbook, notebooks and pens ready before I reach her home. In addition, she will keep extra of the delicacies she has cooked at home to give me.” John added: “She is my mother now. We are sharing a rare kind of camaraderie and relationship.” Kuttiyamma now has her sights set on aceing the fourth standard examination, which normally students pass at the age of nine. This time it involves papers in Malayalam, English, environment and mathematics. “I don’t think English is alien and a hard nut to crack,” said Kuttiyamma. “I will try to achieve 100% marks in the equivalency examination for all papers.’’ John said Kuttiyamma still requested lessons every day without fail, while refusing to let any other family members take over the household chores or the cooking. “Her passion and commitment are exceptional,” she said.",News/World news,"‘I was always curious’: Indian woman, 104, fulfils dream of learning to read",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/curious-indian-woman-104-fulfils-dream-learning-read
12/11/2021,"No one goes to a motor race hoping to see a crash, or so they used to say. It may be less true this weekend, when the promise of mayhem between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen in the final round of the 2021 Formula One world championship promises to attract a vast worldwide television audience. As they prepare for Sunday’s showdown, Verstappen hoping to become champion for the first time and Hamilton in line to surpass Michael Schumacher with a record eighth title, not just individual career landmarks rest on the outcome. It feels as though much more – perhaps nothing less than the entire culture of the sport – is at stake here.  This is not the first season in which the title has gone down to the final race. It is not even the first in which the two remaining contenders have gone to the starting grid at the last round with an equal number of points against their names. But no race in the long history of Formula One has been awaited with such a mixture of excitement and apprehension. The two contenders, level on points at the top of the drivers’ standings, have been crashing into each other since the middle of the season, when the reigning champion arrived at Silverstone having decided that he was not going to allow his young Dutch rival to get away with carving him up any longer. Hamilton may be a streetwise racer, but he has always been a clean competitor and to see him answer Verstappen’s intimidatory tactics with some of his own was an indication of how far the rivalry has gone. If the decision was intended to make his opponent reconsider his approach, it was never likely to work. At 24, Verstappen believes he has waited too long to become world champion. He is already a year older than the age at which, in 2008, Hamilton won the first of his seven titles. Through his style of racing, the Dutchman has made it plain that he follows Ayrton Senna and Schumacher in the belief that nothing and no one should be permitted to stand in the way of his success. Although they stand level on points after 21 rounds, Hamilton starts with the handicap of knowing that if neither of them finishes this one, Verstappen will be crowned champion by virtue of his nine race wins to eight, raising the possibility of the contest being ended by a collision of which only the Dutchman could be the beneficiary. This week the F1 race director, Michael Masi, stressed that such incidents could be punished by the kind of penalties that might affect championship standings. Temperatures are certainly running high. Racing drivers of the past have had their armies of supporters, but their allegiance was never expressed with the sustained mutual animosity shown by the fans of Hamilton and Verstappen on social media or the partisan fervour displayed at circuits around the world. A thick haze of orange smoke is now as common a sight at a grand prix as it has long been at football matches involving the Netherlands or at “Dutch corner” on the Alpe d’Huez. Both drivers are accustomed to hearing boos as they emerge from their cars to be interviewed before making their way to the podium. The duels between Senna and Alain Prost or Schumacher and Damon Hill produced wrecked cars and angry words, but they were conducted with nothing like the ferocity among F1 fans that is reaching its peak this weekend. That will come as a particular delight to the makers of Formula 1: Drive to Survive, the Netflix documentary series that has attracted a new audience to the sport – particularly in the US – through an emphasis on character-driven narratives, lurid crashes and heightened emotions. Its fourth season is likely to raise the pitch of melodrama to new levels. If Verstappen wins out, by whatever means, he may become the standard bearer for a new generation of drivers who, moulded by the video games and simulators in which aggressive tactics can be rehearsed and refined without the possibility of physical consequences, no longer play by the old rules. Drivers of Hamilton’s generation were still partially influenced by the memory of older codes of etiquette, when behaviour on the circuit was regulated not by lines painted on concrete or stewards imposing stop-and-go penalties but by trackside stone walls, trees and ditches. There was also a sense of comradeship among the drivers that crossed the borders of team loyalty and involved a willingness to risk their own lives but not, if they could avoid it, the lives of those with whom they might have shared a hotel breakfast table that morning. Thirty years ago, those protocols began to break down. The Prost-Senna rivalry saw cynical collisions determine the outcome of the championship in 1989 and 1990. Schumacher won his first title in 1994 after barging into Hill. Three years later he failed in an even more blatant attempt, doing more damage to his own car than to that of Jacques Villeneuve. These tactics were made possible by the knowledge that cars and circuits had been made much safer in response to the fatalities of the preceding decades. Young drivers trained in karts were introducing the previously unthinkable idea of Formula One as a semi-contact sport. And whereas significant change in motor racing had usually been confined to the technical side, now it was also behavioural. This season has presented the sport with perhaps its greatest challenge, placing a heavy burden on the shoulders of a rotating cast of stewards whose disciplinary decisions often seem inconsistent and even contradictory. For all the availability of onboard data, they have the task of reading the drivers’ minds and assessing their intentions, a task highlighted last Sunday when Verstappen slowed, ostensibly in response to a demand to let Hamilton overtake, but in such a way that it was impossible to come up with a definitive interpretation of both the initial action and Hamilton’s response. The questionable state of the disciplinary processes was also exposed in Jeddah when Masi was overheard seeking the approval of the Red Bull team for Verstappen’s grid position at the second restart, a hint of weakness that would never have occurred under his respected predecessor, the late Charlie Whiting. But as the world watched Hamilton and Verstappen haring away from the rest of the 20-car field last weekend, there was no doubt that here were the two finest drivers of their era. At Interlagos last month Hamilton demonstrated that time has not dimmed his gifts as he fought his way from 10th to first with a concentrated fury that reminded historians of Juan Manuel Fangio’s legendary fightback against the Ferraris at the Nürburgring in 1957. Verstappen’s brilliance was evident from the moment of his arrival in F1. In Jeddah last Sunday, as a chaotic race was restarted for the second time, he glimpsed an opening at the first corner and sliced past Esteban Ocon’s Alpine and Hamilton’s Mercedes like a shark gobbling shrimps. Also evident, however, were the less widely admired aspects of his deportment on and off the track. His air of arrogance and entitlement is inherited from his father, Jos, whose achievements as an F1 driver never remotely matched his own estimation of his abilities. An equally powerful role in Verstappen’s career has been played by Dr Helmut Marko, an Austrian whose own highly promising career was cut short when he lost an eye in a grand prix accident in 1972 and who has since fashioned the Red Bull driver training programme into the most unsparingly effective scheme of its kind since the Spartans left male babies out on a hillside to see which of them would survive to be trained as warriors. Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, has proved willing to defend Verstappen’s behaviour in all circumstances. This week’s claim that his driver is fighting an opponent in a superior machine looks disingenuous when considered alongside the revision of the current technical regulations which favoured the basic design concept of the Red Bull against that of the Mercedes. Few outside Abu Dhabi and F1’s finance department will rejoice that the final act of a sometimes horrifically mesmerising season is taking place on a track all too typical of the bland computer-designed facilities inflicted on F1 over the past 25 years rather than a traditional circuit based on a more varied set of natural topographic features. Although the elimination of some of the fiddlier corners this year represents an attempt to create more opportunities for overtaking, it’s still a bit like accepting $50m to hold the Olympic downhill ski race on an artificial slope in Milton Keynes. But as Hamilton and Verstappen pull down their visors and twilight creeps over the Persian Gulf, looking away is not an option. In an atmosphere so fraught with tension and expectation, the 13th Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is likely to be the hardest to forget.",Sport/Sport,Hamilton and Verstappen’s gripping duel in Abu Dhabi represents F1's peak | Richard Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/11/lewis-hamilton-max-verstappen-abu-dhabi-formula-one-preview
12/11/2021,"Where did Omicron come from? By all accounts it is a weird variant. Though highly mutated, it descended not from one of the other variants of concern, such as Alpha, Beta or Delta, but from coronavirus that was circulating maybe 18 months ago. So where has it been all this time? And why is it only wreaking havoc now? Researchers are exploring a number of hunches. One is that Omicron arose in a remote region of southern Africa but failed to spread until now. Another is that it evolved in infected animals, such as rats, and then crossed back into humans. But a third explanation is gaining ground as more data come to light, that Omicron arose in a person with a weakened immune system: someone having cancer treatment perhaps, an organ transplant patient or someone with uncontrolled HIV.  The latter possibility has sparked global concern. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to two-thirds of the global population living with HIV. For a whole series of reasons, ranging from lack of access to clinics to fear of stigmatisation and disrupted healthcare, 8 million people in the region are not on effective HIV therapy. Beyond the direct problems this causes with disease progression and vulnerability to Covid – people with advanced or uncontrolled HIV are far more likely to die from coronavirus – is the risk that uncontrolled HIV is driving the emergence of Covid variants. “For me there are two key things,” says Dr Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, who was part of the team that first reported Omicron. “First there is the science that needs to go on to get a better understanding of this. But more importantly, on a public health level, we don’t need to wait for the science. It is a reminder that while addressing the immediate challenge of Covid-19, we also need to intensify efforts to end HIV as a public health problem.” The suspicion that variants of concern can evolve in patients with weakened immune systems is not new. The Alpha and Beta variants, first spotted last year in the UK and South Africa respectively, are widely thought to have emerged after long-term infections in patients. The mechanism was laid out by Charles Darwin more than 150 years ago: evolution through natural selection. If a person is infected with Covid but mounts a weak immune response, the infection can persist for months. In that time, antibodies neutralise some of the virus, but not the versions they bind to less well. These surviving viruses proliferate, mutate and undergo further selection – potentially leading to variants that evade immune defences. A preliminary study posted online this week reveals the process in action. Scientists in South Africa, Lessells among them, traced a particular sample of coronavirus to a 36-year-old woman who was not receiving effective antiviral therapy. Tests revealed that she had harboured the Covid virus for 216 days, in which time it accumulated 32 mutations, making it similar to the vaccine-evading Beta variant. If weakening of the immune system by HIV drives Covid evolution, the researchers say, then antiretroviral therapy must be ramped up to prevent it. Writing in the journal Nature, Lessells and his colleagues make the case more strongly. They warn that the failure to tackle the Covid pandemic “with sufficient urgency” in countries with high rates of uncontrolled HIV “could lead to the emergence of variants of the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that spread more easily between people or render the vaccines less effective”. With Omicron, one possibility is that the virus lingered in an immunocompromised patient for months – explaining why it descends from such an old version – before it acquired the right mutations to break out and spread like wildfire. The effort needed, then, is huge. Covid has caused massive disruption to healthcare services, with HIV patients among those badly hit. More than 1,300 healthcare workers have died of Covid in South Africa alone. Thousands more may leave the profession because of the unsustainable strain. The UK’s hefty cuts to international aid, including slashing funds for the UN agency focused on fighting HIV/Aids from £15m to £2.5m, will hardly help the situation. Meanwhile, 70% of Britons are vaccinated against Covid, compared with 7.5% in Africa. What vaccine has arrived on the continent has been prioritised for the oldest, in line with strategies in many countries, but this means few of those with HIV are protected: about 80% of people with HIV in Africa are under 50 years old. Prof Penny Moore at the University of the Witwatersrand and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa said there was “good data” to indicate that immunocompromised people who could not clear Covid infections as quickly as others were a risk for new variants. “That includes HIV-positive people with uncontrolled viral replication, as well other groups like people on immunosuppressants,” she said. “But this is probably still a rare event. “Increasing access to Covid-19 vaccines will reduce that risk, for sure, and there is a worrying overlap between areas where HIV prevalence is high and Covid-19 vaccine coverage is low,” she added. “I do think we need to translate our sense of urgency from Sars-CoV-2 to HIV prevention and treatment in parallel to tackling uneven vaccine coverage globally.”",News/World news,Why uncontrolled HIV may be behind the emergence of Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/why-uncontrolled-hiv-may-be-behind-the-emergence-of-omicron
