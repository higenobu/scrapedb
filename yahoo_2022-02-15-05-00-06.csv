 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday said that he has been informed that Russia will attack on Wednesday. The comments from the Ukrainian leader, made in an address to his nation posted on Facebook, come amid heightened tensions between Kyiv and Moscow. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border. The troop buildup had raised concerns among the U.S. and NATO allies that Russia is planning a military incursion, but Moscow has continually denied having any such plans. Officials from Ukraine, Russia and NATO nations have engaged in diplomatic discussions for weeks with hopes of easing the tensions in the region but the conversations did not bear any breakthroughs. Zelensky wrote in a statement on Facebook that Ukraine will hold a Day of Unity on Wednesday. He said the relevant decree has already been signed. He said, ""We are told that February 16 will be the day of the attack,"" according to a Facebook translation of his comments. President Biden spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, during which he warned that ""swift and severe costs"" would follow if Moscow invaded Ukraine. Biden administration officials have warned that Ukraine could be invaded ""any day now."" This developing report will be updated.",World/The Hill,Zelensky says Ukraine has been informed Feb. 16 will be day of attack,https://news.yahoo.com/zelensky-says-ukraine-informed-feb-190318842.html
2/15/2022,"My mother left me twice to go live in an ashram, once when I was 6 and then again when I was 12. When I was an adult, she told me her leader felt children were obstacles. After finding out how kids were treated at the ashram my mother lived in, I'm grateful she left me behind. To this day, if someone says ashram, I get the shivers. When I was 6 years old, my mother left for the one her guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh created in Pune, India, and when I was 12, she left again for Rajneeshpuram, his ashram in Oregon. She, like his other sannyasins or followers, donned sunset-colored clothing and a black-beaded necklace around her neck, with a photo of his face dangling from the end. What I didn't know until I was grown and had children of my own is that he was also known as the ""sex guru"". Bhagwan espoused sex as the first step to ""superconsciousness"" and encouraged his sannyasins to embrace a celebratory, free-love kind of lifestyle. My mother was on a spiritual journey and went to the ashrams with an urgency to improve herself, to become a better person and a more evolved parent, she explained to me later. She didn't want to suffer or be in pain anymore. When I was grown and had children of my own she told me that ""Bhagwan taught that children were obstacles to enlightenment."" My heart stopped as all of the dots connected. It must have been so much easier to quit being a parent when your spiritual leader recommended it. By the mid to late 1970s, about six thousand sannyasins — mostly Westerners — lived and worked on and around his six-acre ashram in Pune. He lectured every day, and sannyasins were tasked with whatever jobs, menial or otherwise, needed doing. Sannyasins took part in therapy groups where, in the early days of the ashram, sex and violence were documented to have been used to help followers reach ""breakthroughs"" on their paths to awareness. Incredibly, given the reports of violence and sexual assault that eventually came out about life in the Pune ashram, my mother doesn't recall any of that in the therapy groups and workshops she participated in. It may be that she arrived in Pune after those methods were discontinued. Most crucially to my story, and so many others whose parents followed him, Bhagwan felt children were to be avoided whenever possible as they made spiritual growth difficult to attain. In fact, he encouraged sterilization and vasectomies for sannyasins. The object of the game was to unencumber yourself so you could become the person you were meant to be. Some children did live at Rajneeshpuram, but they weren't looked after much. While their parents swapped partners, participated in meditation sessions, worked on the ashram, and lined up along a one-lane road waiting for the moment when Bhagwan would drive by in one of his ninety-six Rolls Royces, hoping for a glimpse of their master, kids fended for themselves, roamed the property, and were housed separately from their parents. Disturbing news from the ashram eventually made headlines, like the considerable arsenal of automatic weapons on the property, poisonings, and how its inner circle was responsible for the largest bioterror attack on US soil. But there was also abject child neglect, and sexualization and grooming of children by adults. Stories of vulnerable ashram children who were mostly unsupervised have been circulating for years: children dressed improperly for the elements, sustaining serious injuries, modeling sexual behavior on the adults they saw around them, girls as young as 11-year-old in ""relationships"" with grown men. Ashram life requires members to eschew their autonomy and personal boundaries, which is a dangerous blueprint for children who rely on responsible caregivers to protect them as they develop healthy boundaries and their senses of self. Add promiscuity and lack of supervision to the mix and you get nothing but trouble for children. Kids were the opposite of taken care of; the opposite of safe. I've spoken to former sannyasins who lived on Rajneeshpuram, and they told me I was lucky my mother didn't take me to the ashram, that I was better off than the kids they saw growing up there. As much as I missed my mother, as much as her leaving twice impacted my whole life, at least I wasn't left to fend for myself or be sexually abused. I think about those kids and wonder how they are now. I hope they were able to reclaim some of what adults stole from them; I hope they found their way to safety.

2/15/2022,"Whoopi Goldberg returned to The View on Monday after a two-week suspension, opening the show by telling viewers, “Yes, I am back.” “We’re going to keep having tough conversations,” Goldberg said. “And in part, because this is what we’ve been hired to do. And it’s not always pretty, as I said, and it is not always as other people would like to hear. But it is an honor to sit at this table and be able to have these conversations, because they are important. They are important to us as a nation and to us more so as a human entity.” More from Deadline Bill Maher's 'Real Time' Explores The 'Freedom Convoy' Awakening And Whoopi Goldberg's Exile Bill Maher Talks About 'The View' And CNN's Jeff Zucker, Calls For Questioning Covid-19 Authority 'The View' Skips Past Whoopi Goldberg Hot Topic: Says Joy Behar, ""You All Saw The News"" Goldberg was suspended as co-host of the show over comments she made about the Holocaust. Goldberg had apologized, but ABC News president Kim Godwin called her comments “wrong and hurtful.” In a discussion on The View, Goldberg had claimed that the Holocaust was “not about race.” The Anti Defamation League condemned the remarks, and she later issued a written apology. But she also appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and told the host that “I feel, being Black, when we talk about race, it’s a very different thing to me. So I said I thought the Holocaust wasn’t about race. And people got very angry and still are angry. I’m getting a lot of mail from folks and a lot of real anger. But I thought it was a salient discussion because as a Black person, I think of race as being something that I can see. So I see you and know what race you are.” She said that she didn’t want to upset people, but also did not want to “fake apologize.” In her opener on The View today, Goldberg did not specifically refer to her previous comments or offer an additional apology. She instead focused on the response she has received in the past two weeks and the need for the show to have frank conversations. “I gotta tell you, there’s something kind of marvelous about being on a show like this because we are The View, and this is what we do, and sometimes we don’t do this as elegantly as we could … It’s five minutes to get in important information about topics. And that is what we try to do every day.” Goldberg said that she wanted to “thank everybody who reached out while I was away, and I’m telling you people reached out from places that made me go, ‘Wait, wait, what? Really? Okay.’ And it was amazing and I listened to everything everybody had to say and I was very grateful and I hope it keeps all the important conversations happening.” Best of Deadline Cancellations/Renewals Scorecard: TV Shows Ended Or Continuing In 2021-22 Season What's New On HBO Max For January 2022: Day-By-Day Listings For TV Shows & Movies New On Prime Video For January 2022: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
