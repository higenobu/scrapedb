3/12/2022,"Last year, Brad Raffensperger was attracting national headlines for taking a stand against Donald Trump and his lies about the 2020 election. In a phone call that was quickly made public, Trump demanded that Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, “find” enough votes to deprive Joe Biden of a victory in the battleground state. Raffensperger refused to do so and won widespread praise for his courage. Raffensperger is paying for his actions in a way that reveals how his once obscure elected position is now at the center of a battle for the future of American democracy – and attracting all the big money and political heat that entails. This year, Raffensperger is facing a brutal primary race against a Trump-backed candidate, the US congressman Jody Hice, and trying to cling on to his job. Hice, who has said the 2020 results in Georgia would have been different if the race had been “fair”, has already raised more than twice as much money as Raffensperger. Hice’s impressive haul is partly thanks to the unusually high number of out-of-state donations that his campaign has attracted, as more Americans across the country zero in on secretary of state races. And Georgia is not unique. As Trump and his allies continue to spread the “big lie” of widespread fraud in the 2020 race, many voters are focusing their attention – and wallets – on the officials who oversee states’ elections. Secretary of state candidates in both parties are now posting substantial fundraising figures, intensifying concerns over how election administration has become a heated political issue in the US. Secretary of state races have historically attracted little notice and even less money. The winners of these elections assume rather bureaucratic roles, and their duties may include managing state records, overseeing the department of motor vehicles and keeping the state seal. But in many states, the secretary of state also serves – crucially – as the chief election official. In the weeks after the 2020 election, as Trump and his supporters falsely claimed the results had been tainted by fraud, secretaries of state in key battleground states became the target of intimidation and threats. Now the former president is using the power of his endorsement to wield influence in the races for those posts. While Trump did not endorse any candidates for secretary of state in 2020, he has already endorsed three in the 2022 cycle: Hice in Georgia, Mark Finchem in Arizona and Kristina Karamo in Michigan. All three candidates have embraced the lie that Democrats stole the 2020 election by allowing fraud to affect the results. Biden’s margin of victory in each of those states was less than three points, and their input could prove decisive in the next presidential election. “They are willing to overturn the will of the voters in order to choose the winner,” said Kim Rogers, executive director of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State. “It is disempowering, and it is akin to giving an arsonist keys to the firehouse.” Republicans and Democrats’ disparate concerns over election fairness have contributed to a significant increase in donations to secretary of state candidates. According to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, donations for secretary of state races in six battleground states are three times higher than they were at this point in the last election cycle, in 2018, and eight times higher than the 2014 cycle. Fundraising has particularly increased in Arizona, Geor­gia and Michigan, which also happen to be the three states where Trump has issued an endorsement. “A lot more money is going to these once sleepy, bureaucratic races,” said Ian Vandewalker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s elections and government program. “The places that we’ve seen the biggest increase – which is basically Arizona, Georgia and Michigan – each of those places had some degree of nationally covered election controversy around 2020.” The Brennan Center analysis also indicated that out-of-state donations to secretary of state candidates are increasing at an even faster rate than overall donations. Finchem, who has called on the Arizona legislature to decertify the 2020 presidential results in three major counties, already has six times as many donors as every secretary of state candid­ate in the 2018 elec­tion combined. Two-thirds of those donors live outside Arizona. Democrats have taken note of Republican enthusiasm about secretary of state elections, and they are responding by ramping up their own fundraising. The Democratic Association of Secretaries of State and its partner groups raised a record $4.5m in 2021, compared with $1.5m raised during the entire 2018 cycle. The organization has said it is on track to meet its fundraising goal of $15m for the 2022 cycle, in part because of the increase in first-time individual donors. Other progressive groups, including End Citizens United and iVote, have pledged to spend tens of millions more on secretary of state races this year. “The engagement is at every single level. We have seen a massive increase in our email list and grassroots support,” Rogers said. Rogers believes Democratic activists are increasingly turning their attention to secretary of state races partly because they have been frustrated by the lack of progress at the federal level. Congressional Democrats have repeatedly tried to pass national voting rights legislation, which would reverse some of the voting restrictions enacted by 19 states last year, but Senate Republicans have successfully used the filibuster to defeat those bills. “I think there are a lot of activists who got involved in 2020 who fought incredibly hard for the federal voting rights legislation in 2021,” Rogers said. “When 50 Republicans blocked it yet again, folks were looking for a way to stay engaged and to continue the fight, and they shifted their assets into the states.” Republicans complain that Democrats are trying to alter election regulations to their benefit at both the federal and state levels. Andrew Romeo, communications director for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said Democrats were “ramping up their interest in secretary of state races because they see control of these offices as a way to change the rules to compensate for their inability to win elections”. Romeo’s group is an umbrella organization that promotes Republican candidates for state legislatures, state supreme courts and secretary of state offices, among other roles. The RSLC and its policy partner group raised $33.3m in 2021, exceeding their previous odd-year record by more than $14m. But to Democrats like Rogers, the outcome of secretary of state races in key battleground states represents nothing less than the fate of American democracy. “These folks want to rig the game, and they are out to do that,” Rogers said. Vandewalker fears that the increasingly dire messaging about secretary of state races will contribute to a political climate in which both parties distrust the outcome of elections. “Money and attention being paid to these races is not inherently a bad thing. The voters should be informed about these candidates,” Vandewalker said. But he adds, “that kind of rhetoric is extremely dangerous to voter confidence because of course one side or the other is going to win and is going to count the votes. And democracy counts on people accepting the result, even if their side doesn’t win.”",News/US news,‘Arsonists with keys to the firehouse’: once-obscure state races fuel fears for US democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/12/us-elections-secretary-of-state-democracy-brad-raffensperger
3/12/2022,"‘Emmanuel Macron? No, we have nothing at all. People were happy for a day or two after he was elected, but now they all hate him.” It was a disappointing response from a souvenir shop owner in the heart of Paris between the Boulevard St Germain and Notre-Dame. Figurines of Marianne, models of the Eiffel Tower and tricolore-draped bric-a-brac were ranged on shelves looking out over the Seine on my visit in 2018. But there was not a hint of the newish man in the Élysée. Not a single bust, figurine, badge or plate. Rien. Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill globe cup celebrating the 1941 Lend-Lease agreement to provide support for the allies before the US entered the war. The inscription is: ‘Let’s drink to victory. Let’s drink to peace.’ Bought in Portobello Road, London, 2012 I have been collecting political memorabilia for 40 years. It is a pleasurable, but occasionally frustrating, business. Greed and obsession can be a problem, too – and that may well be an understatement. The truth is that I already owned a Macron, albeit encased in one of those tacky plastic snowstorm bubbles, along with hundreds of other objects displayed on cramped shelves in our dining room, which friends, guests and neighbours are generally astounded by on first sight. The main point, however, is in seeing how political leaders – monarchs, dictators and democrats – have been portrayed in the past and present: how sycophantic admirers revere them; how angry opponents or imaginative artists and canny manufacturers choose to present them; and how poking fun becomes an evocative part of the historical record. Above, from left to right, and top to bottom: Angela Merkel lemon squeezer; Benito Mussolini figurine; badge commemorating Beirut protests against the Ottomans; Ghiyath Matar candle and ‘We will not forget you’ scroll; former Uzbek president Islam Karimov plate and Bernie Sanders Bernie or Bust badge; Margaret Thatcher nutcracker; Brexit Express badge; unidentified pipe; Winnie Mandela; Rosie the Riveter; Juan and Eva Perón busts; Muammar Gaddafi watch; Helmut Schmidt dog; Roosevelt and Churchill globe; Wooden map of Lebanon; Queen Elizabeth II clockwork doll; Desmond Tutu figurine; Gamal Abdel Nasser embroidered bag; Greta Thunberg doll; King of Bahrain badge; Donald Trump toilet brush; Ruth Bader Ginsburg; Gibraltar monkey; David ‘Dunce’ Cameron; Israel’s second prime minister, Moshe Sharett; Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum; Vladimir Putin salt cellar; Barack Obamamints and Donald Trump Impeachmints; Hafez al-Assad plaque; former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat; Mikhail Gorbachev; Tsar Nicholas doll; Otto von Bismarck nutcracker; second world war medal; Hillary Clinton doll; Boris Johnson Bollocks to Brexit keyring; clockwork Jimmy Carter peanut; Arafat plate; Ronald and Nancy Reagan Spitting Image slippers; Israeli gas mask figurine; former mayor of Jerusalem Teddy Kollek badge; Sarah Palin badge; badge of Israeli human rights group B’Tselem; unidentified matryoshka doll; Mahatma Gandhi; Kemal Atatürk tableau; doll of former Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion; Brexit badge; Saddam Hussein ‘So Damn Insane’ badge Donald Trump provided a bonanza for memorabilia maniacs like me: bobble-heads display his distinctive haircut. His confrontation with Kim Jong‑un is commemorated in a “Tweety Boy Trump” wrestler figure pitted against “Little Kim Rocketman”. Squeeze the President Dump keyring, and an unpleasant-looking brown bubble emerges from his massive plastic buttocks. A Trump toilet brush at least has a practical use (although mine is on display and not in the loo). But the last occupant of the White House is not the only leader to inspire scatological portrayal. There is an entire series of traditional Catalan caganer figurines depicting high-level poopers – including Boris Johnson and US vice-president Kamala Harris. Trump is, of course, an unusually divisive figure. But he is not alone: Vladimir Putin, generating global headlines because of his widely condemned invasion of Ukraine, exists in the formal plaster or bronze bust commemorating Soviet-era leaders from Lenin and Stalin onwards – as well as in traditional matryoshka (“little matron”) dolls that have been available of Russian leaders since Mikhail Gorbachev ushered in perestroika. (I actually have a fine Leon Trotsky bust, bought in New York, though I’m sure it can’t have been made in the USSR.) A macho Putin riding a bear is available from a Russian manufacturer. But in the US you can also buy a Putin pencil sharpener with the pencil up his rear end. The Middle East is an exotic treasure trove of kitschy political memorabilia. Authoritarian regimes have ruled the region more or less since the fall of the Ottoman empire. It is also rife with conflict, including the issue of Israel and Palestine. My favourite item from that region is one I found in Bethlehem in the mid-noughties: an olive-wood model of a traditional manger scene divided by Israel’s separation wall, symbolising the reality of the continuing occupation. A close second is a large doll of Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben‑Gurion, with his long, messy hair. Tableau featuring Mustafa Kemal, AKA Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first president of the post-Ottoman Turkish Republic, 1923-38. Atatürk is flanked by a soldier and a female worker. It is inscribed: ‘Turk, be proud, work and trust’. Bought in Istanbul in 2004 Above left: plaque of Hafez al-Assad, autocratic Syrian president from 1971-2000, whose son Bashar suppressed the Arab spring uprising and still rules. Above right: nutcracker featuring Prussian and German leader Otto von Bismarck, known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’ for his tough and savvy diplomatic skills The Middle East is also the part of the world where I spent much of my working life as a journalist, including 36 years at the Guardian. Highlights of my collection include a brass portrait of a glowering Saddam Hussein bought in Baghdad after the end of the eight-year war with Iran. From the mid-1980s I made several nerve-racking trips to Iran, where the conflict with Iraq was always billed as a western-backed conspiracy against the Islamic revolution. Prizes from Tehran included a ceramic tile bearing the stern features of Ayatollah Khomeini, as well as a copper profile of the late Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. I bought that in an antique shop adjacent to the British embassy, close to Bobby Sands Street – provocatively named after the IRA hunger striker. Then there was the period from 1993 to 1999, when I lived in London, covering diplomatic and international affairs. I still managed to find a delicate figurine of Mahatma Gandhi in Exmouth market (near the Guardian’s old office on Farringdon Road), a tiny statuette of Paul von Hindenburg (the German chief of staff during the first world war and its interwar president) in Brighton, and an Abraham Lincoln bust while visiting New York to cover the UN general assembly. I also came across a silver metal bust of the Bulgarian president Todor Zhivkov, who ruled his country for 35 years, while reporting on an eastern European tour by Robin Cook, Tony Blair’s first foreign secretary. Part of the pleasure is finding niche figures – the ones little celebrated outside their home countries. Candle and scroll inscribed ‘We will not forget you’, commemorating Syrian activist Ghiyath Matar, who was known for giving flowers to soldiers, and was killed by state security forces in 2011. There is a film about Matar, called Little Gandhi Above left: busts of Juan Perón, president of Argentina from 1946-55 and 1973-74, and his wife, Eva, a working-class actor and accomplished speaker, immortalised in 1976 in the rock opera Evita and the song Don’t Cry for Me Argentina. Above right: figurine of Desmond Tutu, the South African archbishop and anti-apartheid activist who died in December 2021, part of a fine Zapiro caricature series In 2000, I was sent to Brussels. It was not easy covering the EU because of its institutional complexity – and it certainly wasn’t a barrel of laughs. But regular European travel, combined with visits to local flea markets, meant that the opportunities for collecting were endless. I added a statue of King Christian X of Denmark, riding his horse through the streets of Copenhagen in defiance of the Nazi occupation. In Warsaw that summer I found a plaque of Jósef Piłsudski (Poland’s interwar leader) for the złoty equivalent of a few quid. On holiday near Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, I acquired a bust of Marshal Tito, the founder of Yugoslavia. The Waterloo flea market, south of Brussels, became a favourite destination: there, I found a copper bust of France’s interwar prime minister Raymond Poincaré, a stone one of an unsmiling Adolf Hitler (illegal in Germany) and a resin one of the Belgian king Leopold II, the brutal imperial ruler of Congo. No historical monster is beyond the pale; my wife has had to learn to share our home with the villains of my collection. By contrast, one specialist US website has a category entitled “respectable collectables”. Sweden presided over the council of EU ministers from January 2001. Work trips to Stockholm produced two exceptionally good pieces from Europe’s past: Benito Mussolini and Charles de Gaulle, both carved wooden figurines with instantly recognisable features. A visit to Naples produced yet another Mussolini – a big, helmeted bust – as well as Silvio Berlusconi, with his Forza Italia party manifesto, in glazed terracotta in the folkish style of presepio (nativity scene) figures. Moving back to London in 2004 produced an inevitable switch to British political leaders: I got hold of Neville Chamberlain, Harold Wilson and Roy Jenkins in quick succession. All were toby jugs, a classic British form of caricature in clay, dating back to the late 18th century. Small rubber dolls inspired by the Spitting Image TV series (though not the ones used in the show) were a more up-to-date version of those, with Blair and SDP leader David Owen. More spectacular was Osama bin Laden, complete with turban, dishdasha and automatic pistol. Bin Laden was a gift from Alan Rusbridger, the then Guardian editor, in October 2002, just over a year after the 9/11 attacks. I was on my way from Brussels to Dublin, via the London office, when I was given it. Boarding the Dublin flight, I invited problems with security by carrying Bin Laden in my hand luggage, which was scanned. But they laughed out loud. The doll and I made it safely home to Brussels after the EU summit. The only person who was really upset was my 11-year-old daughter who came home from school and was horrified to find Bin Laden – whom the whole world was then hunting – seated grinning at our dining table. Above left: Osama bin Laden Spitting Image puppet – a similar one sold at Sotheby’s in 2001 and the cash was split between Afghan refugees and victims of the World Trade Center attacks. Above right: rug depicting Muammar Gaddafi, Libyan leader, 1969-2011, obtained from secret police HQ, Tripoli, 2011 In the mid-noughties, I found several great items in a shop in Portobello Road, London. Its owner specialised in the brilliant works of an Argentinian cartoonist called Lino Palacio – known as Flax – which were turned into superbly detailed and funny figurines. I own US president Franklin D Roosevelt and wartime Japanese general and prime minister Hideki Tojo. They were quite pricey (£110 each), but I still wish I had bought many more. The Middle East and north Africa remained an abiding source of interest. The Arab spring, which erupted in Tunisia in late 2010, provided not just hope for the region’s oppressed peoples, but a chance to expand my collection. An old friend later said: “I imagine you getting sent to far-flung corners of the world on a purchasing mission, while trying to fit in your day job.” In September 2011 I was in Tripoli, reporting on the aftermath of the Libyan uprising. Muammar Gaddafi was still alive. I was working with a Guardian colleague, Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, and someone told us rebel forces had taken over a state mukhabarat (secret police) HQ. The free gift there was familiar from hotel lobbies and endlessly photographed after the revolution being trampled on by ordinary Libyans: a mass-produced carpet, featuring a portrait of a handsome young colonel. Within weeks, Gaddafi would be killed near his home town of Sirte. But he lives on, warts and all, on our dining-room floor. Friends, colleagues and family have contributed a great deal to what I have taken to describing as “you-know-what” or just “the collection”. Buying online – from eBay, Etsy and specialist websites – is far less interesting than looking in real life, but that has been the only way to scratch that constant itch during the Covid pandemic. Above, from left to right, and top to bottom: Israeli statesman Moshe Dayan; Nelson Mandela plate; Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi badge; Danish EU referendum badge; Bernie Sanders doll; former Turkish president Ismet Inönü; Jacques Chirac; Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky; Amnesty and Bahraini non-sectarian badges; George Bush Sr; George W Bush; pan-European beer mat; Bill Clinton bottle stopper; Pope Francis; Jeremy Corbyn doll; Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid; Putin dog toy; 1997 Denver G8 summit badge; Moroccan rabbi Baba Sali clock; No More Chernobyls badge; 1998 Birmingham G8 summit badge; map of Africa bath plug; Charles de Gaulle nutcracker; Nicolas Sarkozy doll; Prince Philip clockwork toy; TE Lawrence (of Arabia); Martin Luther King Jr; plate featuring Iranian Ayatollahs Khomeini and Khamenei; Israeli soldier; David Cameron badge; Mandela tea; Joe Biden figurine; Mikhail Gorbachev; Portuguese dictator António Salazar; William Hague; Stalin candle; Farsi political badge; Mussolini bust; Hong Kong 1997 badge; figurine of father of Zionism Theodor Herzl; Kim Jong-un; Margaret Thatcher; Kamala Harris badge; Kuwait flag badge; Soviet medal; Theodor Herzl tile We don’t own a dog, but another distinct category is softish toys for pets, which, despite their own views, enjoy playing with and biting political leaders. So far I have Johnson, Keir Starmer, Nigel Farage, Theresa May, Priti Patel and Nicola Sturgeon. International characters include Trump and Joe Biden. Not long ago I had to wrestle one of them (it was Trump) from the jaws of a guest’s spaniel who assumed, quite reasonably, that it was for playing with. Smaller versions are available for cats, all produced by Pet Hates Toys. I also found a sizeable Putin (made in China), but, unsurprisingly, I haven’t yet come across a Xi Jinping for animals. Brexit provided some items – though as a remainer I boycotted leave campaign slogans and T-shirts. I was briefly tempted to buy the 50p coin commemorating the UK’s departure, but was put off by its ridiculous price – £80 to £650 on eBay! My favourite piece is a keyring, saying “BOLLOCKS TO BREXIT: It’s not a done deal”, which hangs on a cartoonish Boris figurine. If only … Over the years I have come to believe that I cannot be too pedantic in what I define as political. There is cultural stuff representing popular national figures – the famous Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum (found in Cairo) and the Good Soldier Švejk, from the Czech novel by Jaroslav Hašek that has been translated into more than 50 languages (picked up in Prague). Another favourite is a wooden plaque, bought in Beirut, bearing the moving words of writer and artist Kahlil Gibran: “If Lebanon was not my homeland I would have chosen it as my homeland.” I also have Rosie the Riveter, the symbol of American determination during the second world war, and a feminist icon. But it is not only about having attractive objects on display. Lots of items are practical, too, though I draw the line at actually using them. These include a Vichy-État bottle opener, a Bill Clinton bottle stopper and a De Gaulle nutcracker. For ages I’ve had my eye on another Hitler, dating back to 1941, with his cloth-covered rear end serving as a pin cushion. But so far I have resisted the temptation. I also have a Blair chocolate lollipop, Nicolas Sarkozy and other French politicians teabags, an Angela Merkel lemon squeezer, a Roosevelt pencil sharpener, a Putin salt cellar and a Michael Foot candle. And then there is the Trump toilet paper …",News/World news,From a Thatcher nutcracker to a Trump toilet brush: my curious collection of political memorabilia ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/thatcher-nutcracker-trump-toilet-brush-political-memorabilia
3/12/2022,"“They treated us worse than the water in the toilet,” said Krzysztof Mikucki, about his experience at British passport control in Calais on Wednesday night. The Polish-born builder, who lives in the UK, was trying to bring his Ukrainian wife and her family to safety, thinking they’d be allowed to apply for visas at the ferry port. Instead, he told the Guardian earlier this week, they were kept waiting for four hours while Border Force staff chatted and laughed among themselves. “At 5.30am they just gave us a piece of paper with a phone number on it.” Stories like this have proliferated since Russia’s invasion began on 24 February. They have all the familiar ingredients of a Home Office scandal: an overly complicated bureaucracy that seems designed to trip immigrants up rather than help them; rude and callous officials; ministers who appear not to know what their own department is doing. Last week the home secretary, Priti Patel, was criticised by some of her fellow Conservative MPs for giving misleading information when she referred to “support on the ground” for refugees at Calais. What’s striking about the government’s farcical response to one of the fastest-developing refugee crises in European history, however, is that it is trying to do the right thing. Unlike in 2015, when David Cameron spoke of a “swarm of migrants” crossing the Mediterranean, Boris Johnson’s government has stressed its openness to refugees from Ukraine. Yet the gap between rhetoric and reality has become painfully apparent – and this isn’t the first time, either. Last August, the government made grand promises of support for Afghans fleeing the advance of the Taliban. Yet thousands of Afghans who made it to the UK languish in cramped and demeaning hotel accommodation – because, the Guardian reported in February, if they find homes of their own then they lose funding for integration. After the Windrush scandal was exposed in 2018, the government promised to generously compensate people who’d had their lives ruined by Theresa May’s hostile environment. Four years on, the compensation scheme is beset by delays and has itself been accused of racism. Once again, the finger of blame is being pointed at the department responsible for carrying out ministers’ wishes. “Does the Home Office need to get a grip?” asked one BBC headline this week. Debate usually centres on whether ministers or civil servants are responsible for this pattern of failure. In reality, it’s both – but the problem is political at root. At the start of the war in Ukraine, ministers had a choice. They could follow Europe’s lead and make safe passage for refugees as frictionless as possible, either by waiving visa requirements or by allowing people to apply for visas once they were in the UK. Or they could leave Ukrainians to wrestle with a system that has been designed to treat would-be migrants as suspect, and to squeeze money out of them wherever possible. (As an example of how petty the system can be, it costs £2.74 to ask a question by email of UK Visas and Immigration – the section of the Home Office that manages visa applications – if you’re outside the UK). Ministers chose the latter, only relaxing the rules piecemeal in recent days after they came under increasing public and political pressure. The problem is that the system can not easily be sped up or made friendlier at the push of a button. Institutionally, the Home Office often can’t cope with the demands placed on it. While I was researching an in-depth profile of the department last year, current and former officials described the way scarce resources were shuffled around according to short-term political priorities, with the result that key operations were often starved of the funds required to run them efficiently. Something like that seems to be unfolding in the UK’s asylum system, where the backlog of cases has almost trebled since 2019, despite there being no significant overall rise in claims. Ukrainians are currently experiencing another bottleneck: nearly 19,000 people have applied for visas in the past two weeks, but only a few hundred have been granted so far. This is not only a question of efficiency. A thread of anti-immigrant hostility and an obsession with control runs through the Home Office, Britain’s “law and order” department, from the upper echelons in Whitehall to frontline staff. As one former official told me last year, there is an intense fear of the “pull factor”: the idea that if you loosen the rules in one place, it will encourage an overwhelming tide of migration. It has been years in the making and is the product of both Conservative and Labour governments, frequently under pressure from a xenophobic rightwing press. You could see these instincts on display last week when, facing unfavourable comparisons with Ireland, which has waived visa requirements for Ukrainians, Home Office sources briefed the Telegraph that Ireland’s open-door policy created a “security risk” for the UK because of the commontravel area that allows relatively free movement between the two countries. In Patel, the Home Office has found a secretary of state who expresses all the department’s worst tendencies. As one of her former colleagues told me last year, she is a “blunt instrument” who seeks to do and say the thing that will be perceived to be the toughest anyone could possibly do or say in any given scenario. When challenged by her opposite number, Yvette Cooper, in parliament this week, Patel said that stringent identity checks were necessary to prevent another Windrush scandal. What she is unable or unwilling to admit, however, is that such elaborate forms of ID are only necessary because her department’s hostile environment policies deliberately reduce people to destitution if their documents are not in order. Patel is sometimes accused of incompetence, but in fact she displays some of the leadership skills that would in theory be required to turn the Home Office around: a clarity of purpose, and willingness to expend considerable personal and political capital in forcing through unpopular institutional change. The trouble is that she is leading the department in precisely the direction guaranteed to make the problems even worse. Her nationality and borders bill, which is being pushed through parliament in the face of fierce opposition from refugee and migrants’ rights organisations – as well as some of her own staff – will introduce a punitive system of refugee protection in which people will face harsh punishment if they do not do as they are told. At the same time, the narrowing of routes for economic migration under the post-Brexit “points-based” immigration system further reduces people’s options in times of need. Patel, though, is the product of a wider political environment. British culture has for years been dominated by a rightwing discourse that presents migration as first and foremost a problem. The Conservative MP Edward Leigh faced widespread criticism when he praised Patel during a debate on 2 March for “not throwing away the immigration rulebook”, since his constituents had already “done our bit in terms of migration from eastern Europe”, but he was expressing an attitude that has dominated this country’s politics for years. Now even the right is up in arms at the failure to do more for Ukrainian refugees. But they should take a long, hard look at the way the system works – because they helped build it. And the Home Office won’t change until this changes too.

3/12/2022,"For ages, I’ve been talking about the power of eating, of gathering around a table of food to share stories, laugh, sing or cry. It is like group therapy. With my family in Ukraine – my parents’ city, Kakhovka, is under siege, and my brother is in training to fight in Kyiv – I don’t know when I will do any of this again, but in tribute to them and to my country, I urge you to cook and eat Ukrainian food right now. Please see the #cookforukraine JustGiving page to get involved with our effort to make food a force for fundraising. Towards the end of April and during May, before much is growing in people’s kitchen gardens, the fields and forests of Ukraine are filled with young nettles and wild sorrel. Foraging wasn’t so uncommon in the past, and is now being rediscovered, in Ukraine and elsewhere. This soup, sometimes called green borsch, can also be made with chicken stock and served with chopped boiled eggs. Prep 15 minCook 1 hrServes 6 2 tbsp rapeseed or olive oil1 onion, peeled and cut into 1cm dice2 carrots, scrubbed and cut into 1cm dice1 small celeriac, peeled and cut into 1cm dice3 celery sticks, cut into 1cm dice1 leek, white part only, trimmed and cut into 1cm dice3 big garlic cloves, peeled1 bay leafSalt and black pepper6 baby potatoes100g sorrel, sliced75g young nettle tops (the top few leaves on each stem)50g wild garlic leaves, sliced (flowers kept for garnish)3 spring onions, thinly slicedA handful of chopped dillA handful of chopped parsleyCreme fraiche, to serve (optional) Pour the oil into a cast-iron casserole set over a medium-high heat. Once the oil is sizzling, add the onion, carrots, celeriac, celery and leek, and saute, stirring from time to time, for about five minutes: you want them to become caramelised in parts, but not scorched. (If the pan feels too crowded, fry the vegetables in batches.) Add the garlic and cook, still stirring, for about two minutes, until fragrant and starting to colour. Add two and a half litres of cold water and the bay leaf, season lightly with salt and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook, partially covered, for about 40 minutes. Add the potatoes whole and cook for 10 minutes, or until they are soft, then add the sorrel, nettles and wild garlic and take off the heat. Taste the soup and add more salt if needed. Put a potato in each soup bowl and lightly crush it with a spoon. Ladle over the broth, then sprinkle with the wild garlic flowers (if using), spring onions and herbs. Serve with a dollop of creme fraiche, if you like, and a good grinding of pepper.

I love vegetables fried in this way, too – cauliflower especially. These days, plain white flour is normally used, but buckwheat flour was popular in the past and it’s healthier, and much more flavoursome. I like to eat these with a spoonful of dill-and-garlic-spiked mayo. Prep 5 minCook 25 minServes 41 small cauliflowerSalt and black pepper1 egg, beaten100ml whole milk60g buckwheat flour, or plain flourVegetable oil, for frying For the dill and garlic mayonnaise150g mayonnaise1 garlic clove, peeled and finely gratedA handful of finely chopped dill Cut or break the cauliflower into small florets, keeping any small leaves, too. Blanch the cauliflower and its leaves in a pan of boiling, salted water: take out the leaves after about two minutes and the florets after five. Refresh both in cold water, then drain well and pat dry with kitchen paper. Put four tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat – it should cover the base of the pan, so add a little more, if need be. Meanwhile, make the batter. In a bowl, whisk the egg with the milk, then add the flour, whisk until smooth and season well; if you’re using buckwheat flour, make the batter only just before you are ready to fry, because it turns gloopier by the minute. Drop four pieces of cauliflower into the batter at a time, making sure they are all thickly coated. When the oil is really hot, bring the bowl over to the pan (otherwise everything will get messy) and carefully drop the batter-coated cauliflower into the pan – depending on the size of your pan, you should be able to fry between four and eight fritters at a time. After a couple of minutes, turn them over and fry on the other side until the fritters are golden all over, then lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a medium oven while you repeat with the remaining cauliflower and batter. (In between batches, you might need to drain and wipe out the pan with kitchen paper and add more oil.) For the mayonnaise, mix all the ingredients in a small bowl and serve with the hot cauliflower.

3/12/2022,"Last week I was telling you to wait. Now I’ve fired the starting gun: it is time to sow. We are now well past the magic number of 10 growing hours a day, with stronger rays of sunlight and warmer soils, so it’s time to get everything from carrots to cornflowers into the ground. But a few words of advice: if you are sowing outdoors, check the soil temperature – anything below 10C is too cold for good, steady germination. If you’re wondering whether you need to invest in a proper thermometer, don’t; your hand is just as good. Wiggle your fingers into the soil: if you can’t keep them there for a minute, it’s still too cold. You can warm up the soil using cloches, fleeces or plastic sheets. The latter, particularly if black, are very good at this, though it still usually takes about two weeks, and in two weeks’ time the sun may be shining anyway. If it’s cold and wet, wait. Covering seeds after sowing with fleece or a cloche can make a huge difference, so if you have them, use them. However, any sort of cover will entice slugs – they never miss an opportunity to be somewhere warm, damp and near food. It’s worth laying out black plastic sheets, old large cabbage or rhubarb leaves or empty grapefruit or orange halves a few days before sowing, so you can clear a whole round of those pests away before the seedlings are up. They are just as hungry for something sweet and fresh as you are. As to what to sow, start with the fastest growers – radishes and rocket – as they will give you a good idea of how the climate is at soil level. If these are up in a matter of days, add others: broad beans, or dwarf peas such as Half Pint, Oskar or Meteor, and Japanese-style turnips. Then, as the days grow longer and warmer, corn salads, landcress, lettuces, leeks, kales, spring onions – and Japanese bunching ones too. If the soil is not too wet, parsley, parsnips and beetroot, swiss chard and spinach beets can go in and, on the warmest days at the end of the month, broccoli raab, summer and autumn caulis, celery and celeriac, brussels sprouts, carrots and tall climbing peas. Anything that can be sown direct can also be sown in a seed tray or module, which often makes more sense as less is wasted through thinning out. Calendula, cornflowers, sweet peas, borage, Ammi majus, Clarkia, field and Shirley poppies and wildflower mixes can all be sown direct this month too. But you don’t have to rush. Even if you wait until the end of March, you still won’t be behind. This is a kind month, and every day is filled with opportunities to go forth and scatter.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"From calendula to caulis, it’s time to start sowing your seeds",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/12/from-calendula-to-caulis-its-time-to-get-things-into-the-ground
3/12/2022,"The first animal Tracey Parsons rescued was a fledgling song thrush she found hopping in and out of the road. It had lost its mother. Parsons was seven. She kept it in her bedroom, where it flew around the room. She went to the library to learn how to feed it. Worms, she read. Parsons dug up her mother’s garden. The bird started following her around. In the morning it would fly up to her bunk bed and sing “the most beautiful song,” she recalls. “It made me feel like Snow White. I’ll never forget it.” Eventually, it flew away. Parsons, who is now 35 and runs the Blackbird Boutique shop in Blackheath, south-east London, doesn’t know how many animals she’s rehabilitated since then. Thousands, she estimates. “I like animals,” she says, “because they’re pure and reflect the delicate beauty of nature. And they don’t have their own voices, so someone has to be their voice and protect them.” Any time an injured bird or animal is found in the area, odds are it will find its way to Parsons’ home. People bring them to her front door all the time. She has rehabilitated peregrine falcons, buzzards, owls, squirrels, kittens, sparrows, deer, foxes and ducklings, all with her own money. She estimates she spends thousands of pounds a year on feed and medication. “The most animals I’ve had at one time was 17,” she says. Songbirds are the hardest to care for. You have to feed them worms every 15 minutes between 5am and 8pm, she says. Squirrels have to be fed every four hours, around the clock. Parsons is currently only caring for a rabbit and a squirrel, but things will pick up come spring, when people start bringing abandoned ducklings and baby squirrels to her door. Once the animals are rehabilitated, Parsons either discharges them into the wild; takes them to Whitby Wildlife Sanctuary if they’re not able to live independently; or rehomes them with loving families if they can live as domestic animals. (She recently rehomed a kitten that had been rescued from the Thames with a neighbour.) “I’ve known Tracey for more than 10 years,” says her friend Diane Blackwell, “She paddles into freezing pond water to rescue ducklings. She’s dashed over to my place to rescue a badly injured fox at 10pm. She doesn’t have an off switch for her rescue work. She’s driven in the most wonderful way.” Around Blackheath, people know Parsons as “the bird lady”. “Or the squirrel lady, if it’s squirrel season,” she says with a laugh. The local farmers’ market donates scraps for her to feed the ducklings. When asked which animals stand out in her three-decade-long career as an amateur wildlife rehabber, Parsons is at a loss. “I could tell you so many stories that would seem unbelievable,” she says, “but they’re real.” One day in 2019, Parsons was at her shop. Both the front and back door were open. When she opened the changing-room curtain she saw an injured fox cub. It ran away, but returned the next day, and every day after that. “I called him Amber,” she says. “He’d jump in my lap, follow me around and sleep in the window display.” People think foxes are aggressive, but that’s not true, she tells me. “They’re friendly, loving creatures. Deers are adorable, too.” Last year, she rehabilitated Jacob the deer and Amy the fox. Sometimes, the number of animals that need care is overwhelming, but Parsons looks after them because nobody else will. “I don’t know why I do this,” she says. “I must be nuts.” Last year, she rehabilitated 95 squirrels in total. This is in addition to her work as a small business owner. “It’s physically and mentally draining,” she says. Music is one way she deals with the stress. “It’s a good emotional outlet,” she says. Parsons has a piano in the boutique, where she composes songs. But as she’s not classically trained, she has no way to write down the notes. “It would make me really happy,” she says, “to be able to have it written down.” Whisper of the Soul is a piano piece she began after a walk on a snowy day. She had the initial melody in her head, but was at a loss for how to complete the song. A client then entered her shop and asked Parsons to play the piano for her. She agreed, and just like that, the rest of the melody came to her. When asked to choose a treat, Parsons knew straight away: she wanted her music set down in a written score. Pitch Perfect music services offered to put it together, and a beautiful book of sheet music arrived at the shop a few days later. “It was such a nice surprise,” says Parsons. “It’s strange, seeing your work in visual format. But it’s so lovely. Thank you.” The animals of Blackheath and the surrounding areas return their heartfelt thanks. Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

3/12/2022,"In the mid-1960s, two disastrous events happened in Wales. One was the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in the north of the country, to create a reservoir that would supply water to Liverpool – an unbelievably arrogant act that destroyed the Welsh-speaking community of Capel Celyn. The other was the catastrophe that occurred in October 1966 in Aberfan, the south Wales pit village where, despite clear warnings of looming danger, a vast spoil tip slid down a hillside behind Pantglas Junior School, killing 144 people, 116 of them children. Both episodes shone harsh light on the neglect and condescension that characterised the British state’s treatment of a country of 3 million people. For example, having been informed of the Aberfan tragedy, the chairman of the National Coal Board decided not to drop everything and visit the scene, but keep his afternoon engagement to be invested as the first chancellor of Surrey University. In this rich and moving history of modern Wales, Tryweryn and Aberfan are portrayed as the low points that led to the revival and protection of the Welsh language, and the eventual arrival of political devolution. But its 500-odd pages contain much more, thanks partly to its author’s inspired decision to write an oral history – a form, he says, “that favours the grain of the voice and the grain of the Welsh voice in particular”. It also allows the text to spin out into compelling digressions. Better still, though the experiences of the Welsh-speaking west and north of Wales are very different from those rooted in the anglophone, (post-) industrial south, common themes of mistreatment and resistance come to life in the form of first-hand anecdotes. Richard King’s 90-plus interviewees range from the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and that ex-resident of Lambeth Palace Rowan Williams, through a multitude of trailblazing activists, to such cultural figures as the writer Rachel Trezise and Manic Street Preachers. All of them capably join the personal to the political. A particularly vivid element of the book is the long saga of sabotage and civil disobedience practised by campaigners for the official recognition of their language: at its peak in the 70s, as they made the case for a Welsh-only TV channel, as they made the case for a Welsh-only TV channel in the 1970s, a thousand members of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the imperfect English translation is the Welsh Language Society) were incarcerated either in prison or police cells. More murky but no less interesting is the mess of unanswered questions that still surrounds the burning down of second homes and holiday cottages between the late 1970s and mid-90s, and the tale of the somewhat eccentric paramilitary organisation that called itself the Free Wales Army. A longer lasting aspect of Wales’s collective identity was heralded by the arrival in some of its rural areas of beatniks, hippies and eco-pioneers, whose belief in what we now call sustainability eventually added a crucial element to the image it now presents to the world. But at the time, their utopian visions were soon overshadowed by the awful convulsions experienced by people in other parts of Wales – not least of the miners’ strike of 1984-85, and the hollowing-out that followed it. “Within months, what had been confident communities with real vitality and strength had become drug-dependent, subject to family breakup, divorce, delinquency of various kinds, rootlessness and social fragmentation,” Kinnock says. Here was a similar abandonment to that seen in Aberfan and Tryweryn. The former south Wales coalfield remains a byword for disadvantage. Nonetheless, Wales now has a tentative confidence in itself, thanks to what King calls a “community of communities”, founded on both politics and a popular-cultural renaissance. A good example can be found on the Manics’ fifth album, This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours: a song titled Ready for Drowning, which presents the flooding of Capel Celyn as a parable about Wales’s treatment by distant centres of power: “Drown that poor thing, put it out of its misery / Condemn it to its future / Deny its history.” As much as the revolts and refusals it describes, this book eloquently rejects that erasure of memory and experience; the result is a work of history whose stories feel as if they are still unfolding.

3/12/2022,"Houseplants aren’t just a way to make your home look better – according to research published this week, some of the most popular pot plants can also have a positive impact on the quality of the air. Research from the University of Birmingham and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) found that in a small, poorly ventilated office measuring about 15 cubic metres, just five small plants reduced levels of the common air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by as much as 20%. The researchers tested low-maintenance, inexpensive houseplants commonly found in UK homes – the peace lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii), corn plant (Dracaena fragrans) and ZZ plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia) – by putting them into test chambers containing levels of NO2 comparable to those in an office next to a busy road. An hour later, each species of plant had removed about half the NO2 in its chamber. Exposure to high concentrations of NO2, which gets into the air when fossil fuels are burned, can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma. The results are good news for the green fingered, but what if you’re one of those people who struggles to keep anything leafy alive? Investing in plants can seem like a waste of money and time, while watching a living thing slowly die in front of you does not make for a cheerful hobby. Experts such as Jane Perrone, who presents the houseplant podcast On the Ledge, say it doesn’t have to be this way. “Those plants are all easy to look after, although the peace lily will wilt dramatically if it doesn’t have enough water,” she says. “I often give the ZZ plant to people who claim they kill plants because it is super tough and adaptable to different conditions, so that’s a good one to choose if you are starting out.” Perrone says lots of people buy their houseplants from supermarkets or the big box DIY stores, they tend to be cheapest there. But this is a false economy, she says, because you could end up with a plant that hasn’t been looked after particularly well and wasn’t worth buying. “If a plant has been sitting around for a while, sometimes it could be already stressed and damaged, so when you get it home, it starts to show signs of that stress.” Instead, if you can, Perrone says it is best to buy from a more specialist grower, such as a houseplant shop or a garden centre, “where there’s actually somebody who’s paid to look after the houseplants while they’re sitting there”. Online specialist plant shops that provide lots of detailed information about what they’re selling and their living requirements are also worth considering, she says, although “a lot is dependent on the packaging and the courier the website uses”. When choosing a plant in person, avoid those which have yellow or brown leaves and if you can, take the plant out of its pot and sneak a peek at its roots, the RHS horticulture expert Leigh Hunt says. “What you’re looking for, outside the root ball, is a little trail of little white roots. That would indicate it’s nice and healthy,” he says. “If it’s been overwatered, those roots will be rotten and brown.” It pays to think about where you are going to put your plant before you buy one, so that you can choose one that is well suited to the environmental conditions of that location. Perrone says many people who struggle to keep their plants alive often massively underestimate how much light all plants need: “No plant is going to be happy long term in the darkest corner of the room.” She recommends either doing your own research online or going to a specialist shop, where staff should be able to help you find something that will suit the conditions of your chosen location. “That’s what you’re paying for, that expertise. The plant may cost you a bit more but hopefully it means you won’t go home with the wrong one,” she says. When you first take a plant home, bear in mind that even if it is a variety that can thrive in the shade it may struggle at first in a dark spot if it has become accustomed to sunnier conditions. “Don’t think you can bring a plant home, put it on a shelf and not look at it for a month. If you’re new to houseplants, observation is really key,” Perrone says. Too much watering – or too little – are problems that many houseplant killers have to overcome. “People often ask ‘how many times a week should I water?’” Hunt says. “And it’s really impossible to say because every plant is different, it grows at different rates, in different temperatures, light conditions and seasons … my general advice to people is push your finger into the compost. If that feels moist, or indeed wet, then don’t water it. If it starts to feel slightly dry, then water it well.” You may need to move your plants around in different seasons or repot them as they grow, so while it’s worth investing in the plant itself, you should avoid spending a fortune on beautiful ceramic pots. “They’re always the wrong size for the next plant you get,” Perrone says. “I buy all my pots in charity shops and repurpose things like salad bowls and casserole dishes.”",Lifestyle/Money,Houseplants: how to buy them – and keep them alive,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/12/houseplants-how-to-buy-low-maintenance-plants
