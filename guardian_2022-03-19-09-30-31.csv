3/19/2022,"In the photographs, Vladimir Putin stands with a faint smile on his face. Behind him, the enormous cavern of a mine stretches out, the earth ringed red and ochre. In other photographs from his visit to the Siberian mining city of Mirny, the Russian president is pictured meeting local miners and inspecting one of the dark stones they cut from the earth. Soon, the rock in his hand will be swept into a vast and complex global supply chain – refined, cut, and polished until it shines and catches the light. Its final form is a glittering diamond – a tiny piece of an industry worth tens of billions of dollars. Russian mines are at the heart of that industry, making the country the world’s largest producer of diamonds, accounting for about 30% of the global market. As Russia’s devastating war on Ukraine drags on, the question of whether to keep buying and selling those diamonds is a quandary for jewellers, diamond companies and the industry bodies set up to regulate them – many of which depend on Russia’s state-controlled diamond sector for supply. In the meantime, industry insiders say US sanctions will do little or nothing to stop the flow of diamonds from Alrosa, Russia’s enormous state-backed mining monopoly, to the west. “These are objectively conflict diamonds: they’re funding an armed conflict against a peaceful neighbour, by a state actor,” says Cristina Villegas, director of the Mines to Markets program at Pact, a development NGO. Russian diamonds do not fit the narrowest industry definition of “conflict diamonds”, which refers to those used to fund rebel groups, but Villegas says they clearly fit the spirit of the term. “The situation with Russian diamonds is that they really became conflict diamonds overnight,” she says – and so far, many major industry groups have remained silent on whether responsible buyers should continue the sourcing. “These things take time to settle on new definitions. But the silence is striking – and it’s hard not to presume it’s because much of the industry is hoping that this goes away or it’s forgotten.” Almost all Russian diamonds come from Alrosa, which says it accounts for 99% of all rough diamonds produced in the Russian federation. A third of Alrosa’s shareholding is directly owned by the Russian state, and another third by regional governments – the Russian republic of Yakutia and its administrations, where many mines are located. Alrosa’s corporate leadership is also closely linked with the Kremlin, and Sergei Ivanov, its chief executive, was specifically targeted by US sanctions. Ivanov’s father is Sergei Borisovich Ivanov, reportedly one of Putin’s closest allies and formerly a Russian minister of defence, KGB colonel general and Putin chief of staff. Alrosa is a significant earner for its shareholders. The company reported sales of $4.16bn in 2021, resulting in a net profit of 91bn rubles ($943m). Independently of Alrosa, the Russian state has an enormous diamond stockpile – the Gokhran – that it has historically used to regulate the diamond market, buying up excess and selling during shortages. “They have, since the 1990s, been purchasing diamonds in order to manage the pricing,” says Dr Hans Merket, a conflict diamonds researcher at Belgium institute IPIS. Gokhran holds periodic auctions of gemstones from state stockpiles, with six auctions in the first half of last year. Diamond.net reported that revenues from one sale came to $139.2m, according to Russia’s ministry of finance. “It’s a state secret, how much diamonds are in that stock,” Merket says. “If they would start selling those diamonds, that could be an important source of revenue.” Even as the United States introduces sanctions on Russian diamonds, however, industry insiders say their current wording does nothing to halt the flow of Russian gems. This is because the vast majority of Russian stones are exported rough. From there, most will go to be cut and polished in India, which processes about 90% of the world’s rough diamonds. Under US customs rulings, this is considered a “significant transformation” – so polished diamonds can be imported as an Indian product, not a Russian one. There is so far no indication that by buying Russian diamonds through India, US companies would breach sanctions. “The sanctions – unless they deepen – are not going to affect the normal business,” Martin Rapaport, a high-profile figure in the diamond industry and founder of RapNet, the world’s largest online diamond trading network, said in a presentation to the industry last week. “The flow of diamonds from Russia to India to America will continue unabated,” Rapaport told the Guardian. “The sanctions are essentially very ineffective. They don’t do anything. This is not going to stop Russian diamonds.” In India, government officials say Alrosa has told them business will continue as normal. Colin Shah, chairman of the Indian government’s Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, told the Economic Times that Alrosa had written to reassure them sanctions would not stop the flow. “Alrosa has assured that they are running their business as usual ... They will be fulfilling all their obligations to their clients in any part of the world,” Shah said. Any decisions to cut off trade with Alrosa are likely to fall to individual companies, industry bodies, or distaste from the general public. But Alrosa has become a key source for many of the world’s largest jewellers – many of whom remain tight-lipped about whether they will continue to buy Russian diamonds. In the weeks immediately following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Alrosa deleted its long-term “our customers” list – usually prominently and publicly displayed – from its website. Archived versions of the Alrosa list, however, reel off a number of prominent international diamond traders and jewellers. Over the past four years, the firm has boasted of long-term contracts with more than 60 firms, including Signet Jewellers, the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewellery, New York firm Leo Schachter, and iconic luxury brand Tiffany & Co. At time of writing, just one of the large western firms listed as a longtime Alrosa customer – Signet Jewellers – has made clear statements on whether it would stop sourcing Russian diamonds. Brilliant Earth, a smaller firm branded on responsible sourcing, said last week it would remove Russian diamonds for sale. In a memo to suppliers on Thursday, Signet said it had “halted all trade in precious metals and diamonds that originate from such sanctioned Russian sources, and you are therefore requested to stop supplying the same to Signet even though the country(s) in which you operate may not have imposed sanctions on Russian precious metals and diamonds”. Wider action against Alrosa could have unintended consequences: a blanket ban could hit the Indian cutting industry, for example, or Yakutian mining communities. In the past, some of the delicate work of deciding what does or doesn’t meet standards for “responsible” sourcing has been taken up by industry bodies. But now key councils set up to reform and regulate the sector have stayed mostly silent on whether trade with Alrosa should continue. The Kimberly Process (KP), originally set up to try to keep conflict-connected diamonds out of the supply chain, has issued no public warnings on Russian supply. The Kimberley Process Civil Society Coalition has called on the KP to “establish if and which measures are required to secure that diamonds produced in Russia or by Alrosa do not contribute to financing this conflict”. At time of writing, KP had yet to issue any formal rulings in response. The Responsible Jewellery Council, one of the industry’s most prominent bodies, aims to set industry standards for supply chain responsibility and “promote trust in the global jewellery and watch industry”. Its code of practice states that members must ensure when doing business that “beneficial owners are not named on relevant government lists for individuals or organisations implicated in … or those financing conflict”. Alrosa has stepped down from the council’s board, but at time of writing remained a member in good standing and maintained RJC certification. The council has issued guidance that members should comply with sanctions, but did not respond to questions on whether it would take further action against Alrosa based on its code of practice. The board and founders include companies that have been major Alrosa’s customers, including Tiffany & Co, Signet and Leo Schachter. Brad Brooks-Rubin, a strategic adviser for the Responsible Jewellery Council and former special adviser for Conflict Diamonds to the US Department of State, published a public statement saying: “Given the role of a Russian state-owned diamond mining company in the global supply chain … The decisions – or, more specifically, the lack thereof – from the Responsible Jewellery Council regarding this company and overall crisis so far are insufficient.” He said: “This is my own personal statement and admittedly one made outside established processes, but I think it is important to be transparent.” Brooks-Rubin told the Guardian the council’s code of practice “provides multiple bases for action against Alrosa”. “I hope there will be a formal investigation into those issues and that action will take place.” Technical compliance with sanctions was not the same as responsibility, he said. “If a company wants to say, ‘We are continuing to source diamonds from Alrosa, because if we don’t, we won’t have any products to sell you’… Let the consumer decide, let society decide whether or not that’s OK,” he said. “But at the moment we have a scenario where … we don’t necessarily give an answer about what we’re doing. And I think that’s coming up short.” The Guardian contacted a number of Alrosa customers. Tiffany & Co and diamond firm Leo Schachter did not return requests for interviews or comment. RJC chair David Bouffard, of Signet, did not return requests for an interview. RJC executive director Iris Van der Veken did not respond to questions regarding Alrosa’s continued membership, or whether the council had told members to pause purchasing Russian diamonds, but referred to a press release indicating Alrosa had voluntarily stepped down from the board and committees, and correspondence to members asking they “strictly follow all applicable sanctions issued in your jurisdictions”. Villegas says key industry bodies’ silence on the matter of Alrosa diamonds has been remarkable – and could taint consumers’ perception of diamonds for years to come. “All the work that has been done over the years to try to turn the industry reputation around, and show meaningful progress towards diamonds that do good [could] be undermined by current silence,” she says. “From the biggest players that have responsibility roles in the industry, or label what’s quote-unquote, responsible? It’s been a deafening silence.”",News/World news,Jewellery industry accused of silence over Russian diamonds,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/jewellery-industry-accused-of-silence-over-russian-diamonds

But, frankly, do the polished formulas of your Blind Sides etc actually work on anyone? We Are the Best! is a far scrappier coming-of-ager about three Stockholm schoolgirls bonding, bickering and bellowing their way to local punk stardom. It’s sweet enough to deliver the warm fuzzies, but tart and jangly enough to be a properly motivational pick-me-up. Think nothing could make you stir from the settee these dark days?

3/19/2022,"Thomas Tuchel is confident that Chelsea’s next owner will be more interested in winning trophies than making money. Chelsea are in an uncertain position as they face up to a future without Roman Abramovich and it remains to be seen who will buy the club from the Russian oligarch. The deadline to submit offers to the Raine Group passed on Friday night, with a consortium led by Todd Boehly, Hansjörg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein viewed as the leading candidate among those groups who have shown their hand publicly. Their chances have been boosted after it emerged that the consortium is receiving extra funding from Clearlake Capital, a California investment firm with more than £45.5bn of assets under management. Raine, the US bank handling the process, received at least 30 offers and its next step will involve selecting a handpicked few to proceed to the next stage. Offers were arriving close to the deadline and on Friday evening it was confirmed that The Blue Football Consortium had made a bid. The group is led by British property tycoon Nicky Candy and involves two Korean companies, Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group. “I can confirm that the two South Korean firms Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group are a significant part of Mr Candy’s global consortium of investors,” read a statement. “Their involvement is representative of Chelsea’s global brand and huge loyal fan base in Asia.” Among its commitments should a successful acquisition go ahead, the consortium is promising to provide fans with an opportunity to acquire a share of the economic and voting rights in the club. “Chelsea is one of the most iconic and successful professional football clubs in the world, with a rich heritage, global following, and a highly valuable brand,” said Candy. “Football clubs are vitally important community and cultural assets, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give football back to the fans and put them at the heart of the operations and strategy of a leading global football club.” Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, in partnership with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin, also submitted an offer on Friday evening, as did a consortium led by former British Airways chairman Martin Broughton and World Athletics president, and Chelsea fan, Sebastian Coe. “The plan will guarantee that the club is never beholden to a single individual or sovereign wealth fund, ensuring that the club never faces a crisis like this again,” read a statement outlining Broughton’s plans. The 74-year-old also acted as Liverpool’s chairman in 2010 to oversee the club’s sale away from the control of Tom Hicks and George Gillett and to current owners the Fenway Sports Group, who have ushered in sustained success at Anfield. The winning group is expected to pay between £2bn and £3bn – the offer from The Blue Football Consortium is believed to be over £2bn – and Tuchel, speaking before Chelsea’s FA Cup quarter-final against Middlesbrough on Saturday, was asked whether that kind of price for a Premier League club is sustainable. “If somebody buys a club for this amount of money then it’s about challenging on the highest kind of level, then it’s about trophies, then it’s about winning and then it’s about being the best you can,” Chelsea’s manager replied. “It’s not about developing a project, it’s not about making money with the club. “Who am I? I don’t know the ideas behind buying a club or any organisation for this amount of money because I cannot afford it and I will never be able to. But that’s what I hope and what I think. I think Chelsea as a club and a structure and an organisation has an awful to offer, and that’s why the price is like it is.” Tuchel, who dismissed suggestions that Manchester United could lure him from Stamford Bridge, said he did not know much about the owners of American sports teams amid interest in Chelsea from the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs, and Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets. “I know the teams but the owners are not so familiar to me,” he said. “I pretty much watch almost every sport because I simply love it – I watch American sport too.” Chelsea are operating under a restrictive licence as a result of sanctions imposed on Abramovich and have had their travel costs capped at £20,000. However Tuchel confirmed they had been allowed to fly to Middlesbrough. There will be only about 700 away fans there after Chelsea’s licence prevented them from taking their full allocation. They are not permitted to sell tickets and unless a new owner arrives soon they face having no fans at either leg of next month’s Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid. Abramovich transferred a company he controlled with tens of millions of dollars of investments, Ervington Investments Limited, to the Chelsea director Eugene Tenenbaum on the day Russia invaded Ukraine, UK corporate filings showed. Tenenbaum told Reuters the purchase was in compliance with laws and regulations.",Sport/Football,"Next Chelsea owner should put trophies before money, says Thomas Tuchel",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/next-chelsea-owner-should-put-trophies-before-money-says-thomas-tuchel
3/19/2022,"Every time I look at the pictures of Mariupol or Kharkiv, I see a corner of Whitechapel in east London. I reacted the same way to images of Aleppo and, before that, Falluja and, before that, Grozny, because buildings crushed to rubble have a sad habit of looking the same. It brings back a memory – or rather something fainter: an inherited memory, one that was passed to me. Its origin is 27 March 1945; the 77th anniversary is a little over a week away. Early that morning, at 7.21am, a V2 rocket landed on Hughes Mansions, a block of flats on Vallance Road in the East End. It killed 134 people, more or less instantly. Among them were two sisters, Rivvi and Feige (pronounced fay-ghee). Feige Hocherman was 33 and she left behind two children, a son not yet 11 and a daughter aged eight and a quarter. The little girl was my mother, Sara. The war was in its final weeks and the bomb that fell that morning would be the very last V2 to land on London. It wasn’t a targeted missile, though if it had been it could hardly have delighted its masters more. For of the 134 people killed by that Nazi rocket, 120 were Jews. It meant that, as a very young child, I somehow thought “Vallance Road” belonged alongside Belsen or Auschwitz in the small lexicon of words to be spoken only in whispers, each of them bywords for terror and grief. I was well into my 30s before I ever went close to that place. And yet, though I did not witness it and though I only ever saw the physical destruction that bomb wreaked through grainy archive photographs, I can honestly say that event shaped my life. Because it shaped my mother’s life. It made her who she was. There were the direct legacies, of course. For many decades, my mother was implacable in her anger towards the Germans, because it was a German rocket that had killed her mother. There would be no German products in our house; no German car. She was no less unbending on the necessity of Israel. For the Nazis, the identity of the victims of Hughes Mansions was no more than a lucky accident; but the fact remained that my mother had lost her mother to a Nazi operation that killed Jews en masse: she had felt the breath of the Shoah on her neck. Like many others, she would never lose the conviction that Jews would always need a place they could call their own and a means to defend themselves. The experience of such intense hurt so young had another, perhaps less predictable consequence: it opened up deep reservoirs of empathy for the suffering of others. “I feel your pain,” has become a joke phrase. But my mother really did feel your pain, even if you were someone she had only just met and whose life she had only glimpsed. Why do I say all this now, nearly 80 years later? Because, as I look at the terrible destruction of Mariupol and the burning ruins of Kharkiv, I remember that the damage done by a rocket or artillery shell cannot be measured in the stark numbers of a death toll or, still less, the impact on infrastructure – though I saw this week that the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after Vladimir Putin has rained fire on that country is estimated at $100bn (£76bn) and it is rising every day. Instead the cost is measured in the aftershocks felt by those who survive the blast: the injured and the maimed, those whose homes are smashed, those children who once had a mother or father but who, in the briefest of moments, had them taken away by a bolt from the sky. That kind of bomb damage cannot be repaired with concrete. It lives on in the children of the dead, and in their children. I know, because it lives on in me. And yet the conclusion I draw from this is not the pacifist’s resolve that no bullet must ever be fired, no missile must ever be launched. For this, too, I learned from my mother: that while war is evil, the greater evil is murderous aggression that goes unchecked. No one would dare say “stop the war” to Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the people he leads, because that would be to demand that Ukrainians allow their children to keep being killed, their bodies tossed into mass graves at speed because it’s too dangerous to linger in the open, even when one of those bodies belongs to a six-year-old girl, buried in the pyjamas she wore when she was hit, patterned with cartoon unicorns. When a killer has his hands around your neck, choking the life out of you, what you need is the strength in your arms to get him off. This is what the Ukrainians are demanding the west give them. It is the right not to make war, but to repel aggression. It is the right to defend oneself against missiles that flatten an apartment building or destroy a theatre, whose basement shields up to 1,500 people, most of them old or very young. It is the right to protect a city where the last inhabitants melt snow to drink, and burn furniture to ward off the icy cold or cook what scraps of food they can find. Given that the west won’t do it, for fear of tangling with a nuclear state, Ukrainians want the equipment – above all the aircraft – to do it for themselves. It’s such an elemental need, and yet many struggle to comprehend it. There are plenty in western Europe and the US who took, or perhaps still take, a dim view of Nato, regarding it as a cold war throwback or an arm of western imperialism and militarism. But Ukrainians saw it differently: for them Nato was the body that might protect them from the neighbourhood bully who had already proved, just eight years ago, his determination to hurt them and take what was theirs. Most Ukrainians saw the European Union the same way. Those in Britain who so casually disdained our membership of the EU or Nato betray an unwitting but unappealing strain of privilege, akin to the trust fund millionaire who insists they never think about money. It’s easy to dismiss something precious when you have lots of it. That goes for individuals with wealth, but also for those countries or peoples who have only ever known the security of having a state of their own, whose borders are stable and where the notion of an enemy attack is all but unimaginable (or forgotten). My mother took none of those things for granted, and because she didn’t neither do I. In eight decades’ time, there will be Ukrainians in middle age who feel the same way, because of events happening right now. The reverberations will keep sounding, through the generations. That is why even short wars last so long. I am the son of that terrified little girl and I always will be. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

3/19/2022,"Mesmerising work by P&O Ferries, whose decision to sack 800 seafaring staff over a Microsoft Teams meeting makes them slightly more distasteful boat owners than several people on the international sanctions list. Indeed, for the duration of the HR chief’s message on Thursday, there may even have been people smugglers in the Channel who would have been more palatable. Certainly, they seem to operate some of the same routes more reliably. And so to how the day unfolded. On Thursday morning, P&O Ferries recalled its vessels to port with the most ominous words in the shipping forecast – “all-colleague announcement” – promising that “long-term viability” was about to be secured. Sounds good! At which point, the human resources guy delivered a pre-recorded message from some kind of middle-management bunker, as though he were coordinating the resistance of a besieged eastern European country and not just avoiding having to look any of the staff in the eye when he tells them they’re being “restructured” with immediate effect. The former employees were informed their jobs would be promptly taken over by cheaper agency workers. Whether this is even legal is a matter of some debate; suffice to say the implications of the story continue to unfurl themselves like the petals of a stinking corpse lily. Having made their peace with losing out on Employers of the Year 2022, P&O Ferries apparently followed up the video message by sending balaclava-wearing, handcuff-trained private security guards on to the boats to clear away all remaining … colleagues, is it? Some staff refused to leave their vessels but eventually dispersed when it was suggested that they were risking their severance. Justified outrage is apparently above their paygrade. Sorry – ex-paygrade. Even the government seems appalled, while a lot of people have a lot of questions. None of which are, “Ooh, is that HR guy single?” For the video alone, he must be judged the worst person associated with ferries since Chris Grayling. (Although, as I know you’ll recall, Chris was more associated with firms that didn’t have any ferries. That was kind of the problem. All right, all right – one of the problems.) I can tell you that a mere four months ago, the HR guy was on LinkedIn pushing a video celebrating P&O Ferries as an employer who wanted to “do things differently”. As this uplifting film explained of working at the company – “It’s not just a job; it’s a career. It’s not just a job; it’s the future of seafaring. It’s not just a job; it’s family.” Righto. Unfortunately, it’s the Roy family. What a crew this is. On his LinkedIn page one of the P&O family’s guys basks in a glowing salutation from one of his previous managing directors. He is quite the man, it says, “especially when facing union challenges. He has a passion for pushing boundaries of existing practice to explore new ideas and methodologies.” I think we’re all on the point of being able to see that, mate. The boundaries of existing practice appear to have been not so much pushed as shat on. Dimly and belatedly realising that perhaps he ought to say something, P&O Ferries’ chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, wrote to staff on Friday morning, touching euphemistically on what he called “changes we’re making to our crewing model”. Why do people talk like this even in their employees’ hour of anguish? It’s not “changes to a crewing model” – it’s sacking them. I see he’s also claiming it is “essential” that staff “avoid posting any comments or views on social media”. So I’m happy to point out that Peter will be paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year to be this much of a cowardly arse. Of course, it’s not just Peter and the P&O family guys we see – in many ways they’re the monkeys as opposed to the organ-grinder. As you’d expect of any self-respecting island nation, Britain’s P&O Ferries is now owned by the Dubai-based DP World. Things we know about DP World? They have a £146m unpaid debt with the Merchant Navy Ratings pension fund, which is supposed to offer P&O Ferries staff security in their retirement. And they’ve also just spaffed £147m sponsoring golf’s European tour. Which seems a little on the nose, even by the debased standards of the age. As for the age, it continues to feel not-as-billed. The movies might have led you to believe that late stage capitalism would feature a charismatically monstrous overlord, shot on a multimillion-dollar lighting budget. In fact, it’s just a HR guy reading off his Notes app, as he explains that your immediate financial devastation is “well beyond the statutory requirements”. Hard to imagine how this could have been more excruciating, unless he had prefaced it with a poem by Bono, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, did the same day in her St Patrick’s Day remarks. Affectlessly aware that they can do whatever they want, executives like our HR guy talk like the hold music to the underworld. Perhaps appropriately. After all, in ancient Greek mythology, Charon the ferryman would carry the newly deceased souls across the River Styx. It was a fairly turbo-capitalist transit system itself, actually – if you didn’t have the fare you had to wander the shores for a hundred years, probably while a lot of spectral figures explained how you could easily have saved for a house deposit if you’d just had the drive to live a bit longer. Charon was described as a “sordid god” by Virgil (who was not the poet Bono is, but still quite good), though that was all thousands of years ago. These days, we should expect our passage to the other side to be helmed by someone very like our HR guy, probably droning “get in the hole” as he watches European tour highlights on his phone.

3/19/2022,"Herald Sun sport reporter Michael Warner has been awarded the top honour at the Melbourne Press Club awards for his scoop on a report that found “systemic racism” at Collingwood football club, which prompted the resignation of club president Eddie McGuire. Guardian Australia also received two awards after five nominations. The judges said Warner’s “genuine scoop set in train a series of events that rocked Australia’s biggest sporting club and its high-profile president to the core”. News.com.au’s political editor Samantha Maiden received the Graham Perkin award for investigative journalism for her reporting on the alleged rape of former Liberal Party staffer Brittany Higgins. Accepting the award, Maiden said she would not speak further about the case, which is currently before the court, but thanked Higgins for trusting her with the story. The Age’s veteran football writer, Caroline Wilson, received a lifetime achievement award for 40 years covering the AFL, a career that was acknowledged as “smashing the glass ceiling” for women in sports reporting. She recounted attending a football writers’ dinner as the first woman to ever to be granted admittance, and being “given an apron and taken up to the kitchen” because they assumed she was there to help. Guardian Australia’s inequality editor, Luke Henriques-Gomes, won the quill for reporting on disability affairs for his work reporting on the National Disability Insurance Commission, including the revelation that a family who won a landmark case over NDIS transport funding were now facing another cut to their support. The judges said Henriques-Gomes’ work “stood out for revealing widespread problems in the administration and provision of services” under the NDIS and “exposed how the NDIS has turned into a bureaucratic and legal nightmare for those often poorly placed to advocate for themselves”. Matilda Boseley was awarded the quill for innovation in journalism for reports she wrote, filmed, starred in and produced for Guardian Australia’s Tiktok account, which have amassed tens of millions of views worldwide. The judges said Boseley’s work was “a remarkable individual effort” which combined clear and accurate journalism “with a refreshing and clever approach to reaching new audiences on a platform not known for its journalistic reach. A remarkable individual effort.” Business reporter Ben Butler was highly commended for the Grant Hattam award for investigative journalism for his work on the Pandora Papers, a joint production between Guardian Australia, the ABC’s Elise Worthington, and Mario Christodoulou, and the Australian Financial Review’s Liam Walsh and Neil Chenoweth. That award was won by Nick Mckenzie and Joel Tozer, for their investigation inside Australian neo-Nazi groups. Guardian Australia sports writer Jonathan Horn was a finalist for the Harry Gordon Australian sports journalist of the year, which was won by Warner.

3/19/2022,"Bradford, County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham county borough have been shortlisted to become the UK next city of culture, it has been announced. The finalists were whittled down from a record 20 bids to eight longlisted regions, which also included Cornwall, Derby, Stirling, and the district of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon. The successful area will take the baton from Coventry, which is the 2021 UK city of culture, with Hull and Derry having previously enjoyed the status in 2017 and 2013 respectively. The start of Coventry’s year was delayed to May 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The UK city of culture competition shows the important role that culture can play in levelling up our towns, cities and rural communities – bringing investment, great events, thousands of tourists and opportunity for people of all ages and backgrounds,” said the arts minister, Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay. “We have seen a huge positive impact in this year’s host city, Coventry, will millions of pounds in investment and thousands of visitors.” The competition, organised by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in collaboration with the offices for Scotland and Wales and the Northern Ireland executive, uses culture as a tool for social and economic recovery. According to the DCMS, as city of culture Coventry has seen more than £172m invested in funding music concerts, public art displays, the UK’s first permanent immersive digital art gallery, improvements to public transport etc. More than a third of event tickets issued to Coventry residents as part of the city of culture have gone to those facing financial or other adversity, and a third of the programme has been co-created with local communities. Hull, during its 12-month tenure, had more than 5.3m visits to more than 2,800 events, cultural activities, installations and exhibitions, and 75% of those who visited in 2017 said it had changed their perception of the city for the better. Nine out of 10 people in Hull thought that city of culture status had had a positive impact and 90% of residents took part in at least one cultural activity, according to DCMS data. This year, for the first time, the eight longlisted bidders received a £40,000 grant to strengthen their applications. Sir Phil Redmond, chair of the city of culture expert advisory panel, said: “Culture can act as a catalyst for community engagement, civic cohesion and a driver for economic and social change as previously seen not just in Derry-Londonderry (2013), Hull (2017) and Coventry (2021), but all those other places who went on a journey to develop their own cultural strategy. “Simply taking part has proved a catalyst in itself. We have had a great longlist to select from, which made the shortlisting difficult, but I am now looking forward to visiting each of the shortlisted places with the panel to witness culture’s catalytic effect in action.” The winner of UK city of culture 2025 will be announced in May.",Arts/Culture,UK city of culture 2025: Southampton and Bradford among those on shortlist,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/18/uk-city-of-culture-2025-shortlist
3/19/2022,"Mikel Arteta says Arsenal must find a way this summer to drastically increase their goal output if they are to become title contenders, suggesting they will require 90 or 100 to challenge for the Premier League. Arsenal are favourites for fourth place but have fallen short against Manchester City and Liverpool when, despite strong performances, they lacked cutting edge in the penalty area. That was evident in Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat by Jürgen Klopp’s side, who have scored 75 goals to Arsenal’s 43 this season, and Arteta knows finding finishers is a priority for his side to evolve. “To be with the top teams this season you need to score 90 to 100 goals at least,” he said. “Somehow you need those goals in the team. Don’t ask me how, but you need them. They have to come. That contribution, how it’s done and how possible it is to happen, you have to find the right pieces to do it. But it’s a non-negotiable.” Last season Manchester City won the title with 83 goals but, in the previous campaign, they came second with 102 while Liverpool scored 85. In 2019-20 City came top with 95 and Liverpool second with 89; Arteta’s point essentially stands and, according to his logic, Arsenal will probably have to find another 30 goals. “If you look at the history of [successful] football teams, they always have that,” he said when it was put to him that players who could guarantee such a return will come with a hefty price tag. “You look at the Barcelona team that won six titles; they scored 100 goals for three years. If you don’t need that then you need to have 30 clean sheets. In the last 11 games, if we can score 11 goals and concede zero we’re going to win 11 games. Or we can score 35 and concede, and we’re still going to have 33 points. But in a very different way.” Arsenal’s recruitment last summer focused on youth, to thus-far successful effect, but Arteta anticipates a shifting of the dial this summer and suggested more ready-made options may come into play. “There are certain things that we have to achieve in the summer that are not always especially age-related, but things we want to add to the squad,” he said. “There are a lot of topics that are very important and we have to find the right piece. When we find that player, maybe the top priority won’t be the age in that position. Maybe in another one, yes. So we’ll have to get that right.” Arteta spoke of having “more winners in the team that can now take that drive they have, the experience to do that, and they can be contagious to the rest of the team”. Arsenal travel to Aston Villa for a Saturday lunchtime fixture that, coming less than 72 hours after the Liverpool game, caused Arteta to rail at the Premier League’s scheduling this week. “I get all the points and how everybody tries to explain the situations,” he said, continuing the theme. “It cannot affect one club, that’s what I’m saying. If there are more involved I think we have to share that responsibility and try to do it with equity so the integrity of the competition is always there.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta targets 100 goals if Arsenal are to be title contenders next season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/mikel-arteta-targets-100-goals-if-arsenal-are-to-be-title-contenders-next-season
3/19/2022,"The death of a young woman at a privately run hospital could have been prevented, an inquest has concluded. Emma Pring, 29, killed herself while an inpatient at Cygnet hospital in Maidstone in April 2021. She was seen as a risk to herself at the time of her death and had been diagnosed with PTSD and depression, caused by surviving two sexual assaults. She was receiving trauma therapy at the hospital, which the inquest heard she found “extremely difficult”. Caroline Sharp, Pring’s mother, told the inquest in Maidstone that she felt her death had arisen over a “cry for help”, and that she was “a ray of light through her own darkness to her family and friends”. “I’m deeply concerned this was a cry for help, and her death was avoidable,” Sharp said. Pring, who was finding it difficult acquiring a placement for trauma therapy, was admitted at Cygnet after the NHS Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group agreed to fund her stay at the hospital. Sharp told the inquest that she thought it would be a “turning point in her life”. The inquest heard how she found the trauma therapy difficult, and had phoned her mother saying that she “couldn’t cope”. While at the hospital, Pring had self-harmed and was taken to A&E on one occasion, although her mother was not informed. On returning to Cygnet, Pring was placed on 15-minute observations due to her risk level. However, Tom Stonate, the barrister representing Pring’s family, put forward the view that a one-to-one, full-time observation regime could have prevented her death. Dr Daniela Herescu, a consultant psychiatrist at Cygnet, said that other steps, such as giving Pring “anti-ligature” clothing, had been taken. On Friday the inquest jury agreed that one to one observations “could have prevented her death”. It found that her death occurred due to an “insufficient level of observation, and a misjudgement of Emma’s actual risk”. The coroner, Catherine Wood, is also considering whether to issue Prevention of Future Deaths Reports regarding risk assessment and information sharing at Cygnet hospital, and about the lack of national standards in relation to the manufacture of anti-ligature clothing in the UK. Sharp said that she thought her daughter would be receiving the best care “money could offer”. “When Emma was transferred to Cygnet Maidstone on 23 July 2020, I thought that Emma would receive Rolls-Royce care, the best money could offer,” she said. “I hoped it would be a turning point in Emma’s life. Instead, Emma was utterly failed by Cygnet. “The jury’s damning findings vindicate the concerns about Emma’s care we have had all along. She was struggling to cope with the trauma therapy she was being given, and her cries for help – which were getting increasingly desperate – were ignored. It is a tragedy to know that her death was preventable.” Lucy McKay, a spokesperson for INQUEST, said: “Society must do more to respond to trauma and support survivors of sexual assault long before their health reaches crisis point. Mental healthcare providers nationally should reflect on the evidence of this inquest, including the dangerous use of ‘anti-ligature’ clothing in place of adequate risk assessment and observation.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/19/2022,"No sooner had the fourth official, Michael Salisbury, who had the thankless task of pacifying two bickering benches throughout an ill-tempered, illogical and, frankly, ludicrous contest, indicated there would be at least eight more minutes of mayhem in this bonkers match, Leeds contrived to register one final, barmy twist. Luke Ayling, who had kept a hanging stoppage-time free-kick alive at the back post, lashed in from close range to cause chaos on the sidelines and pandemonium among the ballistic away fans in the lower bank of the Steve Bull Stand. Kalvin Phillips and Joe Gelhardt were among the unused substitutes who instinctively charged from one side of the pitch to the other to join the celebrations. It was a simply remarkable and potentially season-shaping comeback win, and a game that will live long in the memory, regardless of persuasion. It was utter chaos but Wolves, who squandered a two-goal lead, were left sick with fury. Raúl Jiménez’s controversial sending-off was the turning point for a Leeds team exposed in the first half by a rampant Wolves side, when goals by Jonny and the substitute Trincão, who arrived midway through the first half in place of the injured Rúben Neves, seemed destined to set Wolves on their way to a third successive victory. But two goals in four second-half minutes after Jiménez, already on a booking, was sent off for colliding with Illan Meslier, the Leeds goalkeeper, totally altered the landscape and Wolves had to play for virtually the entire second half with 10 men. “That decision changed the game,” said the Wolves head coach, Bruno Lage, whose clipboard lay forlorn on the floor of the away technical area after Leeds’s equaliser. At the final whistle, Leeds’s flurry of injuries felt a long time ago. By the time Meslier was replaced by Kristoffer Klaesson, thrown on for his debut with 55 minutes gone, Leeds had already exhausted their substitutes. Patrick Bamford hobbled off in tears after 21 minutes after attempting to latch on to a through ball before Diego Llorente and then Mateusz Klich were also forced off. Raphinha, meanwhile, missed the game with Covid. Wolves were also forced into a reshuffle after Neves’s knee injury. Jesse Marsch said a distraught Bamford’s “reaction could look like a bad injury” but suggested it was nothing more concerning than plantar fasciitis. For Leeds, a rip-roaring victory – and a second stoppage-time win in five days – lifts Marsch’s side seven points above the relegation zone. “I’m learning more and more about the identity of Leeds United and it’s gritty, it’s never-say-die,” Marsch said. “I told them [the players] this was not just one of the best results in my career but that I’ve seen in a game, and it’s almost two games in a row. It is about the character and the hearts of our men. The players deserve all of the credit.” It was a jam-packed first half and a disastrous one from a Leeds perspective, even if Marsch’s men began with plenty of gusto. Bamford squandered their best opening on 11 minutes. Daniel James seized on Neves’s abnormally loose touch and Bamford, faced with the Wolves captain Conor Coady, bared down on goal but screwed his shot wide. Marsch applauded from the sidelines but the picture quickly changed, as Wolves were allowed to stretch their legs. But Jiménez’s red card swung the pendulum and Jack Harrison’s goal a couple of minutes later fuelled Leeds’s belief. For Jiménez and Wolves, it was a sense of disbelief. The manner of the equaliser was nothing short of absurd. Stuart Dallas lay prone, grounded from a poor challenge by João Moutinho, who was lucky to avoid going the same way as Jiménez, but Leeds nevertheless pushed forward. James hit the woodwork when attempting to lob José Sá in the Wolves goal but the hosts failed to eliminate the danger. Romain Saïss’s wild clearance ballooned into the air and the Leeds substitute Sam Greenwood, who replaced Bamford, coolly controlled the ball and located Rodrigo, who skittled his shot inside the near post. Three minutes earlier, Harrison had fired in from close range after Ayling smacked a post. It was a game that had the fingerprints of some of the topsy-turvy games during Marcelo Bielsa’s reign. Wolves supporters raged as they trudged away, fresh from jeering the referee, Kevin Friend, off the pitch but a hoarse Marsch roared towards Angus Kinnear, the Leeds chief executive, and the rest of the travelling contingent in the directors’ box as he headed down the tunnel. An ecstatic Ayling, who attempted the striker Robbie Keane’s cartwheel celebration, bounced his way off the pitch, receiving a hero’s welcome from the Leeds coaching staff who stayed pitchside to greet the captain and his teammates. “From day one they accepted me,” Marsch said of his players. “None of them have made fun of my accent,” he smiled.",Sport/Football,Leeds pull off thrilling comeback as Ayling grabs victory at Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/leeds-pull-off-thrilling-comeback-as-ayling-grabs-victory-at-wolves
3/19/2022,"A lack of local supporters among the Bridgetown crowd has been a source of lament, but those who did pitch up on the third day were treated to a pair of fine centuries from Kraigg Brathwaite and Jermaine Blackwood that left England’s bowlers once again searching for answers on the road. Brathwaite would struggle to make an all-time Barbados XI, such is the rich history of cricket on this island and the talent it has produced over the years. The West Indies captain is a seasoned opener nonetheless, and over the course of eight and a half hours he repelled allcomers, reaching the close unbeaten on 109 from 337 balls for what was his 10th Test century and his third against England. By this stage he had lost Blackwood, his vice-captain, after an impressively restrained innings of 102 from 215 balls had been ended by the loopy off-spin of Dan Lawrence, lbw offering no shot. It was a bizarre miscalculation and a bonus for England’s weary players. But as their supporters headed off to the Friday night fish fry at Oistins, West Indies were 288 for four from 117 overs in reply to England’s 507 for nine declared, needing 20 more runs to avoid the follow-on. The draw appears favourite on another docile pitch, one that will earn much-needed revenues for the Barbados Cricket Association. But England had a couple of opportunities to break a fourth-wicket partnership of 183 from 68 overs that started out from 101 for three in the morning session and led to some words being exchanged between Blackwood and Ben Stokes after tea, such was the frustration it created. The first of these came when Blackwood was yet to score and was struck in front of the stumps by Stokes amid a thundering six-over spell during the second hour. With the naked eye it looked a strong shout – umpire’s call on impact with leg stump at worst – but Stokes dissuaded Root from sending the decision upstairs, only for the subsequent Hawk-Eye projection to return three reds. The second was a moment of agony for one of England’s two debutants, Saqib Mahmood, who in the 93rd over sent a searing yorker to the base of Blackwood’s stumps on 65, only for replays to show he had overstepped. He was instantly consoled by Stokes who, along with Mason Crane, Tom Curran and Mark Wood in recent times, had also seen his maiden Test wicket scrubbed off for a no-ball. Blackwood, it must be said, played superbly. The Jamaican right-hander has a reputation as a mercurial talent, something furthered by his dismissal on the final day in Antigua. But he got his head down here, offering stout defence and a keen eye for a single. He also laced 11 fours. At 4.57pm local time, as he guided Jack Leach for a single that sealed his third Test century, the celebration was joyous. It was a template that had been set by Brathwaite at the other end. After resuming on 28, with West Indies 71 for one and still 436 runs in arrears, the 29-year-old has batted through four sessions without offering a chance in a way that befits his cool character. Even upon reaching his century – a first on his home ground in Test cricket – he lifted his bat with the air of a man who had simply completed that day’s Wordle. The reprieves for Blackwood came with a sense of justice for West Indies too, having questioned the earlier removal of their rock from the first Test, Nkrumah Bonner. Given out lbw to Stokes for nine on the field, Bonner reviewed instantly amid a belief there was an inside edge. Both ultra-edge and replays hinted at vindication for the batter, only for the third umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, to decide he did not have conclusive evidence to overturn it. Less debatable was England’s first incision when Shamarh Brooks, Brathwaite’s overnight partner, slapped a long-hop from Leach to backward point on 39 and trudged off bereft. With Leach having enjoyed some sharp turn early on, hopes rose that his deployment at one end, allied with the seamers rotating at the other, might see England chip away at more regular intervals. As it was, Leach was only steady and Root’s seamers toiled. Chris Woakes appeared drained of confidence – never more so than after tea when Brathwaite drilled him for two fours off the second new ball – while England’s two newcomers, Mahmood and Matthew Fisher, bounded in with good energy but only fleeting threat when the ball offered a smidgeon of reverse for the former. Root has lost his chief point of difference on this tour, too, with Wood now ruled out of the third Test in Grenada – and the Indian Premier League that follows – with the elbow injury he picked up in Antigua now requiring specialist opinion back in the UK next week. The slog will have to continue without him.",Sport/Sport,Brathwaite and Blackwood lead recovery to frustrate England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/brathwaite-and-blackwood-lead-recovery-to-frustrate-england
3/19/2022,"The family of the British-Iranian detainee Anoosheh Ashoori had to scramble at the last minute to raise £27,000 to pay a fine to the Iranian government, delivering the money in cash to the authorities in Tehran’s Evin prison for it to be counted and authenticated. The Iranian government told British Foreign Office negotiators late on Monday that his release would be blocked unless the fine, linked to his 10-year jail sentence, was paid the following day. Ashooori was released along with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Wednesday after the UK paid Iran a longstanding £400m debt. Iranian authorities arrested Ashoori in August 2017, when he was visiting his mother. In August 2019, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison – 10 years for allegedly “spying for Israel’s Mossad” and two years for “acquiring illegitimate wealth”. Ashoori denied both charges. Ashoori’s wife, Sherry Izadi, told the Guardian: “We had less than 12 hours to raise the money, taking out loans using our credit cards, and opening new accounts. My only thought was: ‘How are we going to do this in time?’” She added: “At first the government officials in Tehran demanded my nephew meet them outside the prison with a suitcase full of cash, but he demanded he went inside the prison and be given a receipt. They kept dragging it out, demanding to count the money and check whether it was counterfeit.” She also revealed that when she spoke to her husband in prison by phone on Monday she had been sworn to secrecy by the Foreign Office and was unable to tell him that a negotiating team was in Tehran finalising his release. He had been told that he was about to be conditionally released, but he did not believe it until he was on a plane since similar promises had been made before. “I could not tell him what I knew since I was told lives were at risk,” she said. Elika Ashoori, the daughter of Anoosheh Ashoori, said they struggled to draw attention to her father’s plight because the UK media did not see the family as “very relatable”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Elika Ashoori said the family had experienced an “outpouring of love” since her father’s return but the last five years of his captivity had been very different and they had to fight for help. She said: “It has been a very big struggle trying to get my dad’s name out there; we were slightly more successful in the last year of our campaign because of the efforts of Amnesty and other organisations that finally joined us. “But because of his name, age, his looks, us being grownup children, and us not being very relatable so we couldn’t really engage on a major scale with the media and public no matter how hard we tried.” The family, not wealthy, are planning a crowdfunding website to help them pay back the £27,000 debt. In Tehran conflicting reports emerged about the fate of Morad Tahbaz, the British, American and Iranian citizen who the UK was unable to persuade Iran to release along with Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Distressed members of the Tabhaz family claimed he had been taken back to Evin prison after only 48 hours on furlough at his family home in Tehran. But the UK Foreign Office said it had been assured by the Iranian government that he had gone to the prison only to have an ankle tag fitted that should have been installed when he initially left the prison. The Foreign Office said any extended stay back in the prison would be in breach of the undertakings given to the British government that the 69-year-old conservationist was being put on indefinite furlough. It added it was still working with the US to secure his permanent release.",News/World news,"Iran made Ashoori family raise £27,000 in 12 hours to secure his release",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/iran-made-ashoori-family-raise-27000-in-12-hours-to-secure-his-release
3/19/2022,"Courtney Lawes has branded suggestions Eddie Jones’s job is under threat if England end another disappointing Six Nations campaign with defeat against France on Saturday as “ridiculous”. England have lost their two trips to Paris under Jones and a third defeat against the grand-slam chasing French could condemn them to a second successive fifth-place finish in the championship. Jones survived the inquest into last year’s dismal campaign but a repeat performance will lead to another uncomfortable post-mortem at the Rugby Football Union, less than 18 months before the 2023 World Cup. Despite having grand designs on the title, England have managed victories over just Italy and Wales so far this championship and, excluding the game against the Azzurri, have scored only two tries. Lawes, however, has brushed off the criticism facing Jones and England, who head into the final weekend of the championship already out of the title race for the second year in a row. He said: “The thing is everyone’s complaining nowadays. It doesn’t matter what you do, how good you’ve been or whatever, somebody’s going to find something to complain about. Somebody’s always going to say ‘this person should be doing this, shouldn’t be doing this, should be in the team or shouldn’t be’. At this point it’s so ridiculous that there’s no point in even looking. To be honest, we don’t use it as motivation, no, because there’s no point in even watching it.” While the criticism of Jones is growing louder, he retains the public support of his players. This week Sam Simmonds issued a passionate defence of the head coach and Lawes was similarly glowing, crediting Jones with an upturn in form that has seen him playing a key part on the last two British & Irish Lions tours. “He has been massive for my career and really helped me push towards my potential,” added Lawes. “It’s been massive. I don’t know how many Lions tours I would have got without him and if he hadn’t given me a kick up the arse. Certainly we all dig in for the staff, every member of staff, every person who helps us is important to the team. We essentially want to go out there and play for all the people, including each other, that have helped us to get to this point and who we feel we owe it to, essentially.” The difference between beating France and finishing third, or losing and ending the championship in fifth again, is around £1m in prize money for the RFU and victory would alleviate the pressure on Jones with a three-Test tour of Australia to come this summer. It would also go some way to vindicating Jones’s New England project but of the starting XV only three players – Maro Itoje, Ben Youngs and Jack Nowell – have tasted victory in Paris. “This is a special opportunity for us as a team and individuals so I think we’re going to be ready to go,” said Itoje. “Playing against France is always competitive, but we’re playing for England here. Our motivation is to win and we don’t want to let this game pass us by. Playing for England is a massive honour and there is a responsibility that we do our best each time. “You can’t take these type of moments for granted. You never know when they’re going to come again. The future is not guaranteed, but what we can guarantee is living in the present. As a team and individuals we want to take full advantage of the opportunity.” Discounting matches against Italy, England have managed just two victories in their last 10 away matches in the Six Nations and two years ago at the Stade de France managed to scramble a losing bonus point only at the death. Jamie George this week acknowledged the need to silence the French crowd and Itoje added: “They’re loud. They’re noisy. They love to support their team, especially when they’re doing well. They perhaps go a little bit quiet when things aren’t going their way. But when their team is on top and they have momentum, they’re amongst the loudest fans on the circuit.”",Sport/Sport,‘Ridiculous’: Lawes swats aside talk of Jones’s England job being on the line,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/ridiculous-courtney-lawes-eddie-jones-england-job-france
3/19/2022,"There was no fairytale return for Katarina Johnson-Thompson at these world indoor championships, for all her efforts to hurl her body back into the white heat of competition after just a few weeks’ training. The defending pentathlon champion had dreamed of more shiny metal in her first competition since sustaining a horrific calf injury at the Olympics. But five months of rust proved too great an obstacle to overcome as she pulled out before the final event, the 800m. But while Johnson-Thompson was all smiles afterwards, another British athlete - 21-year-old Holly Mills - was heartbroken after her brave attempt at a bronze medal fell just short. This was Mills’ first global event and she immediately made her mark by equalling her personal best of 8.15 in the 60m hurdles, which was joint quickest alongside Belgium’s Noor Vidts, who ended up with gold. After a disappointing high jump and shot, Mills then soared to 6.28m in the long jump to move up to fourth before the 800m. However her chances of a medal were slim given she needed to run the event nearly 10 seconds quicker than the American Kendell Williams. Mills gave it a damned good go, powering into the lead and finishing with a PB of 2:09:97 to finish on 4673 points. But while Williams was taking on water at the end of the 800m, her time was enough to pip Mills by just seven points. “It was painful to take,” said Mills. “I ran my absolute heart out of there, I was so close.” Johnson-Thompson, meanwhile, insisted she was “fit and happy” despite finishing her competition early. “I came out here and I was super rusty,” she said. “But when you think about my career over the last two years, with Covid and the Achilles rupture, you can count the competitions I’ve done on one hand, so I can take so many positives from that.” The 29-year-old decided to compete after being offered a wild card by World Athletics as she was showing good form in training. But, in truth, she always looked a little off the pace in Belgrade. Her time in the 60 hurdles, 8.45 sec, was just eighth out of 12 competitors - while her 1.83m high jump clearance was 15cm below her very best. An impressive shot put of 13.02m, in her weakest event, kept her hopes of a medal alive. But after a 6.08m long jump she decided enough was enough. “I’m not scared to come out here and get beat,” added Johnson-Thompson. “For me, the most important thing was I wasn’t going to risk injury and get hurt. My body is in great shape.” Meanwhile there was a shock in the women’s 60m as Mujinga Kambundji took gold in 6:96 sec, a time that ranks as the joint-fourth fastest in history. No one had given the Swiss athlete, who started the final as a 28-1 underdog, much of a shot. However a stunning start, and powerful final 30m, took her clear of the American Mikiah Brisco, who won silver in 6.99.

3/19/2022,"Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has praised Fox News for its coverage, appearing on the Russian state-controlled RT network to hail the right-leaning US cable channel, whose primetime host Tucker Carlson has played down the invasion. “We know the manners and the tricks that are being used by the western countries to manipulate media, we understood long ago that there is no such thing as an independent western media,” said Lavrov, speaking in English in a studio interview on Friday. “If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative point of view,” he said. Sergey Lavrov(RUSSIAN foreign minister) praises Fox News for its Ukrainian coverage. pic.twitter.com/RHLJjhDyMb He also denounced the social media ban of former president Donald Trump and took exception to the description of January 6 rioters as terrorists. “But when you watch other channels, read the social networks and internet platforms, when the acting president was blocked and this censorship continues in a very big way … Whenever something is happening by the way of mass protest, mass demonstrations – which they don’t like – they immediately call it domestic terrorism. “So it’s a war, and it’s a war which involves the methods of information terrorism,” he said. Russian media regularly play clips of Carlson criticising the US and Ukraine, and he was still praising President Vladimir Putin hours before Russia invaded Ukraine almost four weeks ago. In contrast, as Moscow’s bombardment escalated, Russian apologism by numerous Fox hosts, commentators and guests was being corrected on air by the network’s own national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin. The mental split-screen effect only sharpened earlier this week when a Fox news team on the ground in Ukraine came under Russian fire on the frontline. Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova were both killed during a Russian attack outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Correspondent Benjamin Hall was badly wounded in the incident. Lavrov’s comments on Friday came as six western nations accused Moscow of using the UN security council to launder disinformation and spread propaganda, after Russian diplomats again raised allegations that the US was involved in biological weapons, which have been repeatedly denied by both Washington and Ukraine. Western diplomats slammed the claims, with Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, calling Russia’s tactics the “disinformation of the desperate”.",News/World news,Russian foreign minister praises Fox News coverage of war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/sergei-lavrov-praises-fox-news-coverage-ukraine
3/19/2022,"Adefiant young woman imprisoned in a perspex cube no longer wants to be called Antigone. Darren Murphy’s new adaptation of the Greek tragedy seems similarly ambivalent about its origins, as if unsure whether to shrug off the original entirely. In his reduced version, subtitled “after Sophocles”, the city of Thebes has been ravaged by a dangerous virus. During this state of emergency, X’ntigone (Eloise Stevenson) has joined a resistance movement against her uncle Creon’s government. About to proclaim Freedom Day, Creon (Michael James Ford) promises to release her if she denounces her dead brother as a traitor. Emma Jordan’s sleek production for Belfast’s Prime Cut and the Mac has a futuristic edge, with Ciaran Bagnall’s design suggesting an art gallery where seductive technology enables new forms of surveillance and control. In an intense confrontation between uncle and niece, each accuses the other of “weaponising” the virus. Bristling with references to culture wars, including plans to destroy statues of dead statesmen, intergenerational conflict is the central theme here, powerfully portrayed. X’ntigone’s disgust at Creon’s cynicism is expressed in Stevenson’s physical revulsion, while Ford’s tone is smoothly supercilious, mocking her new “playground name”. Amid the focus on political spin, the central drama of conscience drifts far out of sight through over complication. Issues are piled on, from biological warfare to corruption, with the Oedipus family backstory adding layers of murkiness. Threatening to release a lethal new strain of the virus, X’ntigone says: “Sometimes you need to destroy the world because the world is broken.” It is a nihilistic credo, bleakly shifting the moral balance of the play’s arguments, so that the only choices left are between different degrees of destructiveness.

3/19/2022,"Are Real Madrid any good? They are 10 points clear in La Liga but the sense is that Spanish football is in retreat. They were outplayed for two and a half hours of the last-16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain and for all the brilliance of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric in those final minutes, it’s also true that the turnaround was as much the result of another PSG collapse as anything they did. Although Carlo Ancelotti’s substitutions made an impact, with Eduardo Camavinga’s energy a major factor, they remain reliant on an ageing midfield. And the feeling with Spanish sides for some time is that physically they are not comfortable against an aggressive press – which perhaps, as much as the need to deny Kylian Mbappé space to accelerate into, explains their weird timidity in Paris. Madrid will also be aware that Chelsea’s victory over them in last season’s semi-final was more comfortable than the 3-1 aggregate scoreline may have suggested. Although uncertainty haunts the European champions after the sanctions against Roman Abramovich, performances have remained good and there has always been a sense that Thomas Tuchel’s slightly more conservative model of the pressing game is better suited to European competition than the league. Prediction Chelsea win Atlético are going through one of their periodic crises of identity, as they toy with switching to a more expansive approach before returning to the defensive, deep-lying spoiling and counterattacking that brought victory over Manchester United. This has not been a classic Atlético season. Even with 10 games to go they have let in more goals than ever before under Diego Simeone, a detail only partly to do with an attempt to push higher up the pitch. Jan Oblak has been one of the best goalkeepers in the world since joining Atlético in 2014, but this season his save percentage has dropped from 75-80% in the previous seven years to 54%. At the other end, João Félix, at 22, looks as though he may be delivering on the expectations that persuaded Atlético to pay £113m for him in 2019. It was after a slightly freakish Champions League semi-final defeat in 2016 for his Bayern against Atlético that Pep Guardiola started making unexpected tactical switches in European ties in an attempt to head off the threat of potential counters. A repeat is probably a bigger danger to City than the infinitesimal downturn in form that has reopened the Premier League title race. Prediction City win Whenever Unai Emery coaches outside of Spain, it doesn’t quite seem to work. But with not-quite-superclub Spanish sides he is a master, particularly in knockout ties. Victory over Juventus in the last 16 was meticulously planned and clinically executed, and as Manchester United found repeatedly over the past year, Emery is very good at setting up a side to prevent the opposition playing. The return of Gerard Moreno from injury, coming off the bench with 17 minutes remaining in Turin, means they have a cutting edge. That said, they are seventh in Spain. Bayern, while a formidable attacking force, are vulnerable in two ways. First, their squad is relatively slender and while Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso should return to bolster the midfield options, Alphonso Davies’s heart problems led to Bayern deploying a back three against RB Salzburg. Although the Austrian side were ultimately overwhelmed, there were repeated occasions when they got in behind the wing-backs, which suggests Arnaut Danjuma could be a threat. The other potential weakness is the inexperience of their 34-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, who has not got the best record in big European games, although admittedly with teams far less gifted than Bayern. Prediction Bayern win There is a fine line between a perfectly judged European away performance and just getting lucky and, in the last 16, Benfica were probably on the wrong side of it. They were outplayed at home by Ajax but scrambled a 2-2 draw, and then were outplayed to an even greater degree in Amsterdam, pinching a 1-0 win thanks to a goalkeeping error as their opponents missed a string of chances. Darwin Núñez is a centre-forward of clear ability, Rafa Silva’s surges down the right caused repeated problems for Ajax, and may threaten Andy Robertson, and the goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos made a number of fine saves, but Benfica surely can’t be so fortunate again. Their domestic form is no better than average: Nélson Veríssimo took interim charge when Jorge Jesus was dismissed in December, and his win in Amsterdam was only his seventh in 15 games. Liverpool have been in exceptional form, winning 14 of 18 inside 90 minutes this year. Of the other four, two were in two-leg ties they won, one in the Carabao Cup final which they won on penalties and the other a 2-2 against the European champions, Chelsea. With Luis Díaz added to the forward line in January, Jürgen Klopp has described this as the greatest squad he has managed.

3/19/2022,"They say it’s a woman’s prerogative to change her mind but such is Rachael Blackmore’s quiet determination to be known first and foremost as just a jockey, rather than a female one, that it ought to have come as no surprise that she stuck to her guns and elected to ride A Plus Tard in this year’s Gold Cup despite being beaten into second place on him 12 months ago. While the novelty value of Blackmore’s gender in a massively male dominated, often brutal profession has gradually dissipated to the point where it barely merits a mention, it is worth noting for the record that she has achieved yet another historic milestone in becoming the first woman in the 98-year history of the race to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup. She did so in fine style, pulling 15 lengths clear of Minella Indo, the reigning champion and one of two Henry de Bromhead-trained runners in the 11-strong field that Blackmore could have requested the leg-up on. Decisions, decisions. On the eve of the race, Blackmore had said she was “really looking forward” to renewing her Gold Cup acquaintance with A Plus Tard, but we can only imagine the internal anguish that came with being so spoiled for what amounted to a coin-toss choice. Had she decided to swap, ride Minella Indo and lose to A Plus Tard, her judgment would almost certainly have been called into question by an army of armchair jockeys who have never ridden anything more temperamental or subject to the vagaries of form as a bicycle. Had Minella Indo prevailed again without her on board, her decision to stick with A Plus Tard would have looked similarly foolish, bordering on stubborn. To the untrained eye, it looked as if Blackmore might have blown it as she watched her mount’s stable companion begin to pull away at the third last. Stuck behind a wall of four horses, she and A Plus Tard looked to have no visible way through. Unperturbed, horse and rider bided their time and in her post-race debrief, Blackmore said the galloping equine roadblock lined across her strip of track had actually worked to her advantage by preventing her from jumping the gun and going too soon. Push came to predictably vigorous shove at the business end of the race, when she squeezed through a narrow gap that opened between Protektorat and Al Boum Photo before flicking the switch and sending A Plus Tard to hunt Minella Indo down. “I knew I had more horse under me approaching the last than last year,” said Blackmore, who was modest enough not to mention that A Plus Tard also had a lot more jockey than 12 months ago on his back. Since finishing second last year, Blackmore has added the Grand National and a second Champion Hurdle – among other notable pots – to an increasingly stellar CV. Having had her fairytale breakthrough at Cheltenham 12 months ago somewhat spoiled by Covid and her incorrect choice of Gold Cup mount, for the second time this week Blackmore was once again allowed to enjoy the warm and raucous welcome back to the winner’s enclosure which was denied to her last year. The most popular Festival-winning jockey since her retired colleague Ruby Walsh, it is a measure of the high regard in which she is held that despite saddling three winners earlier in the afternoon, a beaming Willie Mullins made his way to the chute through which she was parading towards the winner’s enclosure to give her a big thumbs-up. Also in attendance in his role as co-owner of third-placed Protektorat: serial winner Sir Alex Ferguson, who looked similarly pleased as he gave her what looked suspiciously like a wave. Of course Blackmore and A Plus Tard’s success meant that there could be no win for the well-fancied Galvin, which was ridden by Davy Russell and trained by Gordon Elliott. Having served his ban for an almost unfathomable act of stupidity which led to millions around the world seeing him photographed sitting astride a dead horse 13 months ago, Elliott may well have earned his shot at redemption but the sight of him grinning on board the most prestigious podium in racing at the first time of asking since the renewal of his licence would almost certainly have come too soon for a general public who might in time be willing to forgive but will almost certainly never forget. “You can’t do this without the horses and being attached to Henry’s yard is just absolutely phenomenal,” said Blackmore in her post race interview with ITV. “To give me this horse is unbelievable. I don’t know what to say. I’ve had so many special days. I wouldn’t swap the Grand National for anything, but this is the Gold Cup. I wish I had something better to say right now. I just can’t.” This is a constant, almost apologetic post-race refrain of Blackmore’s: one in which she repeatedly feels the need to explain how bad she feels at not having the requisite vocabulary to put her increasingly regular post-race feelings of euphoria into words. It really matters not one whit – as long as she continues to let her riding do the talking, it’s difficult to imagine that too many punters will care.",Sport/Sport,Rachael Blackmore reaps Gold Cup reward for sticking with old friend | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/18/rachael-blackmore-lets-her-riding-do-the-talking-after-gold-cup-triumph-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing
3/19/2022,"It will be no surprise if Chelsea executives approach the double doors leading into the Riverside Stadium’s boardroom with an element of trepidation on Saturday evening. Whoever among the Stamford Bridge hierarchy imagined that it might be a good idea to pick a fight with Steve Gibson this week swiftly learned a harsh lesson as, quite justifiably, Middlesbrough’s famously feisty owner raked his metaphorical studs down their shins. With sanctions imposed on Chelsea’s outgoing owner, Roman Abramovich, by the UK government dictating they can no longer sell match tickets, the London club demanded that Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final on Teesside be played behind closed doors for “reasons of sporting integrity”. Shortly after Gibson had declared that, among several other things, Bruce Buck, Chelsea’s chairman “lacked intellect” and the London club were “rotten to the core”, the demand was dropped. Accordingly the Riverside will be filled to near-35,000 capacity with about 700 seats occupied by those away fans who bought tickets before the imposition of sanctions on a Russian owner with ties to Vladimir Putin. All ticket receipts will be donated to Ukrainian war victims and related charities. “I agree with the sanctions and I think our club handled that nonsense magnificently well,” said an approving Chris Wilder on Friday as he prepared to pit his promotion-chasing Championship side against the European champions. “Steve, in his honest, blunt and forthright manner said it how it was.” By kick-off Gibson’s mood may have mellowed with his thoughts turning to recollections of a watershed Saturday afternoon in late August 1995 when the newly built Riverside staged its first game. Thanks to goals from Craig Hignett and Jan Åge Fjørtoft, Bryan Robson’s team won 2-0. A Chelsea side managed by Glenn Hoddle and featuring Ruud Gullit at sweeper had hoped to brush aside recently promoted opponents, but that defeat rather set the tone for a somewhat mediocre season in which they finished 11th in the Premier League, one place ahead of Boro. Given history’s habit of repeating itself, Chelsea fans may be disinclined to recall that football’s spotlight was then dominated by a Newcastle team revitalised by Sir John Hall’s takeover and Kevin Keegan’s inspirational management. Newcastle would eventually allow the title to slip from their grasp and finish second behind Manchester United but, 26 years on, a Saudi Arabian-led buyout has transformed them into potentially the world’s wealthiest club. No one knows whether a new Chelsea ownership faced with the prospective challenge of reconstructing or replacing Stamford Bridge will be able, or even inclined, to take on an ascendant Newcastle, let alone Manchester City, Liverpool et al, in the transfer market. Moreover, despite Thomas Tuchel’s repeated protestations of happiness in west London it would not be a huge shock were the German to defect to Manchester United this summer. By then Wilder hopes Boro will be back in the Premier League. As part of his preparation for Saturday’s tie, the former Sheffield United manager watched Chelsea beat Newcastle 1-0 last Sunday and he departed Stamford Bridge determined to return on a league assignment with his players next season. “It brought back some really good memories and hammered home that it’s where we really want to be,” said Wilder. “It’s a special division the majority of the world’s best managers and players want to be part of.” Significantly Gibson represents a big reason why England’s top tier has become so enticing to so many. In 1995 when the then Chelsea owner, Ken Bates, became distracted by disagreements with his vice-chairman, Matthew Harding, Gibson was busy plotting to make his club as global as his international chemical distribution business, Bulkhaul. That August, Fjørtoft, Gullit and Chelsea’s Russian goalkeeper Dmitri Kharine – now coaching at non-league Hemel Hempstead – were the only non-British and non-Irish players on view at the Riverside but two months later the Premier League’s topography shifted when Gibson secured Juninho’s £5m signing. As Boro officials talked the Brazil attacking midfielder out of an initial desire to live next door to that Aladdin’s cave otherwise known as Marks & Spencer in the town centre, Gibson and Robson spearheaded a revolution destined eventually to draw, among others, Abramovich and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to the Premier League. As Chelsea fans continued to mourn Harding’s death in a helicopter crash, the Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli arrived on Teesside from Juventus for £7m at the start of the 1996-97 season. When he scored a hat-trick against Liverpool on his debut it became clear precisely why Boro had elected to spend £40,000 a week on making him the best-paid player in Premier League history. With the Brazilian midfielder Emerson and Italian defender Gianluca Festa signing from Porto and Internazionale respectively that longstanding Boro footballers Mecca, the Tall Trees nightclub in the nearby Georgian market town of Yarm, assumed a newly exotic vibe. Similar glamour swiftly spread south, enveloping Stamford Bridge. With Hoddle departing to coach England, Gullit became Chelsea’s manager in the summer of 1996 and wasted no time in recruiting Gianfranco Zola, Ginalucca Vialli, Roberto Di Matteo and Frank Leboeuf. The following May, the Dutchman led Chelsea to their first trophy success in 26 years: a 2-0 FA Cup win against soon-to-be-relegated Boro. Wilder, after beating Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds, hopes to ensure Chelsea do not reach Wembley and seems slightly disappointed an increase in their government-controlled travel allowance means they journeyed to Teesside by air rather than road. “From my viewpoint there’s not a lot of sympathy towards Thomas and the players,” said Boro’s manager. “But I don’t think there’s an incredible amount of sympathy for them anywhere in football.”",Sport/Football,Steve Gibson and sanctions leave Chelsea facing tough tie at Riverside,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/steve-gibson-and-sanctions-leave-chelsea-facing-tough-tie-at-riverside
3/19/2022,"In the end it was probably the private zoo that did it. Or the hall of mirrors. Or the talk in the bread queues of drunken banquets where the mille-feuille flowed like wine. Perhaps it was the queen’s private faux-rustic village where she pretended to be a farmhand while glugging porcelain jugs of cream at her marbled bench. I don’t know about you, fellow peasants. But I feel objectified. Either way historians agree that the March on Versailles, a key event in the French revolution, was sparked by the sense that all this boundless excess – those mirrors, the cream, that alpaca – was in the end just a little too much. Reading the details this week of Erling Haaland’s proposed transfer from Borussia Dortmund to [A Massively Wasteful Super Club], it was tempting to wonder what it might take for football to feel something similar. The anger and alienation around sport is very real but also diffuse, distracted by the lights. Perhaps it will take some hard details to focus the energy. How much is too much? How much more are we willing to consume passively from beyond those long French windows? According to the latest figures floating around Haaland’s move will cost £300m all in. That figure includes wages, sale fee and worst of all an estimated £30m cut for the agent Mino Raiola. Raiola has added nothing to the spectacle. But he will still receive a sum eight times the amount Sport England puts into grassroots football each year for doing not much more than a spell-check on some contracts and clamping himself like a parasitic homunculus to this divine, hard-honed talent. It is tempting to simply goggle at the this gratuitous excess. But it is also vital to remember that this is real money: it’s your TV subscription, your match ticket, your advertising value. It’s every underfunded point of access, every club in danger of going to the wall. Just as the bellows of triumph at each new broadcast deal are the sound of someone else selling this shared treasure back to you for an exorbitant cut. Then of course there’s the game itself. What is the combined effect of these strange forces? Haaland is already a remarkable figure. There has never been a talent quite like this, so obviously compelling (and he is staggeringly good) and so relentlessly commodified. This is the first star footballer not just processed through the modern machine but born into it, to the extent the midwife probably insisted on a sell-on clause on the delivery table. His talent is so obvious, such a known quality. There are early stories of his dramatic promotion from the under-fives to the under-sixes. Has there ever been such a sense of inevitability, of bolt-on success ready to be cashed in by the wealthiest party? At times it feels as though this has already happened, that we are already standing outside it tallying up the numbers, the shiny pots, basking in the hall of mirrors. It is a tribute to the scale of Haaland’s talent, and to the game itself, that he is still fascinating. Those who saw his father play will remember a really good bad footballer. This is not a slight. English football was like that. Haaland Sr, who kicked the ball like a steam engine shunting a cart, who moved at right angles like a mobile crane manoeuvring, was good enough to win that first battle for space and time. Erling is something else altogether. Watch him and immediately the pitch looks too small, the game too simple, the other players too flawed. There is no real element of surprise here, no corners, just a player able to execute every basic skill with supercharged technique, power, conviction. He moves in straight lines because straight lines are the best lines. He scores goals because goals are good and make you win. Watch his Bundesliga highlights reel back and at first you think, OK, he loves crosses. He just has that preternatural eye for finding space, a skill that would make him utterly irresistible at Manchester City. But before long teammates are discovering he can do anything, from cute diagonal runs to headers to balls pulled out of the air via some kind of time-freezing power, to moments where he takes possession in his own half, devours the ground like he hates it, and annihilates the ball into the furthest corner past some poor cowering human. He doesn’t get bored or seek unnecessary variation. He doesn’t want to stop or fall over (Haaland is 120th on the list of 139 most-fouled regular strikers in Europe). Is it entertaining? Can you love this? Even with Kylian Mbappé, more of a one-off, self-made player, there is a sense of edge, fragility, the unexpected. With Haaland you just wonder about the numbers. How many can he score? How much can he win? Which of the available super-teams will he make into the winning super-team? This of course an illusion born out of his style, an appearance of easy efficiency that comes from that same old place, talent and hard work. And there is jeopardy here. Haaland has had injuries and missed games in the last year. No real cause for concern, but he has also played 200 games already, processed through every level as the asset, the show, the thing to be stretched to its limits. There are other kinds of drama too. Signing for Manchester City would be a deeply logical step. Everything in this equation points to success. But let’s face it, given the maths of this, the feeling of irresistible forces gathering, failure would be so much more of a twist. More importantly, can he remain happy? Will we break him? Haaland seems smart, fun and mischievous enough to survive this process. Quite what the numbers, the leeching of wealth, the extreme monetising of an extreme talent does to the rest of our game is another question.",Sport/Football,Erling Haaland and the £300m question: how much is too much? | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/18/erling-haaland-and-the-300m-question-how-much-is-too-much
3/19/2022,"Last week the France coach, Fabien Galthié, invited a special guest to address his squad before their trip to Cardiff. And so, into this room of brawny, outsized men steps the author and philosopher Charles Pépin, who proceeds to pepper the players with gnomic rhetorical questions. “What is a beautiful team?” he asks. “What is a real team? Is it ultimately nothing more mysterious than a sum of talents? Or is it something more?” It’s interesting, by way of contrast, to speculate on who might conceivably deliver an equivalent lecture to the England camp. You may remember that a few years ago, the guest speaker invited by Eddie Jones to address his team ahead of the World Cup was the former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane. And perhaps there is a certain cultural divide at work here. In France, a country that has always had a healthy esteem for public intellectuals, it is sport that can learn lessons from wider society. The very opposite is true in this country: here sporting currency possesses its own insoluble and universal mystique, as evidenced by the fact that one of our most celebrated popular philosophers is a guy who used to play table tennis. But then in many ways this is also a trait specific to Galthié himself: a coach who for better or worse has always sought to challenge his players, to provoke them, to rip them out of their comfort zone and force them to confront new problems. Before their grand slam showdown in Paris on Saturday night, there has been a good deal of talk about how a young French team will cope with this entirely new scenario: a potential first clean sweep since 2010, the sort of pressure and stress that can force players to crack. Yet in another sense France have spent the last two years in a state of high stress because that is simply the nature of playing under Galthié: a restless, ruthless and divisive coach whose perfectionism, according to those who have played under him, verges on obsession. At half-time against Wales last week, his dissatisfaction was palpable, despite his side’s 10-9 lead. “Twice they scored three points from opportunities that you gave to them,” he railed bitterly in the Cardiff dressing room, directly addressing No 8 Grégory Aldritt and singling him out for blame in front of his teammates. In contrast, it is usually the other coaches and senior players who take on the responsibility of delivering more uplifting, positive messages. At times like this, one is reminded of the many criticisms of Galthié that have accumulated over the course of his career, often in regard to his man-management skills: a blunt, brusque manner high on censure and low on sentiment. “Humanely, you are worthless,” the former Stade Francais wing Raphaël Poulain once told him. “You shouldn’t be allowed to coach. You rip up your players like a dog feeding on scraps of meat.” This extends to Galthié’s relationship with the media. “There are no Toulousains in the French team,” he snapped on Thursday at a reporter who pointed out that there were nine Toulouse players in his starting XV. “Or Bordelais, Clermontois or Parisians. This is our French team.” Yet, thus far, all the signs are that the Galthié method is enjoying remarkable success. A team stuffed with talent and secure in its own supremacy has responded in electrifying fashion, building on its progress last autumn and storming to the verge of a grand slam. Perhaps the most impressive element of this French side is its lack of discernible weaknesses: outstanding carriers in the pack, matchwinners all over the backline, a strong kicking game and an ever-present running threat. International rugby at the highest level is as much a game of eliminating flaws as accentuating strengths, and it is in this respect that Galthié has left his deepest imprint. Such is the assurance of this French side that you occasionally get the impression their biggest fear is not the opposition but their own complacency. If everyone does their jobs, they win. The contrast with England here is stark, and particularly with Jones, a coach who seems to revel in playing up his team’s limitations, hedging their chances, toying with expectations, even bizarrely suggesting that this game is simply an acclimatisation exercise for the next World Cup. “Six weeks together, we don’t fuck it up now,” François Cros urged his teammates in Cardiff last week, and we can expect a similar attitude against the English, where the odds will be loaded in their favour. If France do manage to keep their heads and bring their A-game on a clear and crisp Paris night, it is England who will be facing the deep and meaningful questions.",Sport/Sport,"Restless, ruthless, obsessive … but Galthié has France reaching new heights | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/fabien-galthie-france-six-nations
3/19/2022,"Joe Biden spoke for nearly two hours with Xi Jinping as the US sought to dissuade China from backing Russia’s war on Ukraine. A White House account of the call on Friday said that the US president “described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians”. A senior administration official said there would be consequences “not just for China’s relationship with the United States, but for the wider world”, but would not give more details on whether Biden had gone into specifics on possible sanctions, other than to point out what had happened to Russia as an example. “The president really laid out in a lot of detail the unified response from not only governments around the world, but also the private sector to Russia’s brutal aggression in Ukraine,” the official said. “The president made clear that there would likely be consequences for those who would step in to support Russia at this time.” Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the attack. “The president really wasn’t making specific requests of China. He was laying out his assessment of the situation … and the implications of certain actions,” the official said. “Our view is that China will make its own decisions.” The Chinese account of the conversation in the state news agency, Xinhua, said it was “candid and in-depth” but gave little detail about Ukraine. The report said that Xi expressed the wish that the war was not happening, but gave no sign of what the Chinese leader’s intentions were towards support for Moscow. Xi said the situation in Ukraine had developed to such a point “that China does not want to see” according to the report, which stuck to Beijing’s policy of avoiding the words “war” or “invasion”. Beijing’s readout of the call did not suggest any Chinese role in ending the war. It quoted Xi as referring to a favourite aphorism, “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger’s neck take it off”, a seeming reference to China’s position that the US and Nato are ultimately to blame for Vladimir Putin’s actions. Beijing blames the war on Nato’s refusal to rule out future Ukrainian membership of the alliance, and western supplies of weapons to the country. Xi also expressed concern about the impact on Taiwan, which he has vowed to restore to rule from Beijing. Xi claimed “some people in the United States are sending the wrong signals to the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces, which is very dangerous”. “If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries,” Xi added. The US “One China” policy acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China, but Washington does not recognise Beijing has sovereignty over the island. Before the call, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion. US officials fear that Xi has already decided to give Russia economic assistance and some military aid, though it unclear what difference Chinese arms supplies would make on the battlefield, as the more sophisticated weapons, like drones, would not be compatible with Russian equipment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, both had hour-long conversations with Putin on Friday morning, According to Scholz’s office, the German leader had “put pressure on [Putin] to introduce a ceasefire as soon as possible, to improve the humanitarian situation and to make progress in the search for a diplomatic solution for the conflict”. A spokesman gave no details on whether any progress had been made, adding that the conversation had been focused on the war and attempts to stop it. In the Kremlin’s version of the conversation, put out ahead of the statement from Berlin, it was described as “harsh but businesslike”, with Putin complaining about war crimes he said had been committed by the Ukrainian army, referring to attacks he said had taken place in the eastern cities of Donetsk and Makiivka that had led to “numerous deaths”. “These war crimes are being ignored by the west,” Putin said according to Russian news agency reports referring to the Kremlin. Putin reportedly told Scholz the Russian army “is doing everything to avoid civilian victims”. According to the Kremlin’s account, Putin accused Ukraine of trying to “slow down” the discussions with Russia, and said that the government in Kyiv was making “unrealistic suggestions”. It added that the Russian leadership was “ready to seek solutions appropriate to its basic views”. The Kremlin account of Putin’s call with Macron said the Russian president had talked about the Kremlin’s approach to peace talks with Ukraine but gave no details. The Elysée Palace said Macron had said he was “extremely concerned” about Mariupol, which has suffered constant shelling. According to the Kremlin version, Putin repeated the claim that Russian forces were doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties. The US, UK, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway have all accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, and the prosecutor at the international criminal court has begun collecting evidence. The UN’s international court of justice has ordered Russia to halt its invasion, declaring that it had no evidence to support Russian claims, used to justify the attack, that Ukrainian forces were committing genocide against Russian speakers in the east of the country. The UN security council met on Friday to hear a repetition of Russia’s unsubstantiated claims, circulated after the invasion as a justification, that Ukraine had run biological weapons laboratories with US help. “The UN was clear that there was no evidence. It was nonsense then. It’s nonsense now,” the UK permanent representative, Barbara Woodward, said afterwards. “And as far as we’re concerned, frankly, this is the disinformation of the desperate. Things are clearly not going well for Russia in Ukraine.”",News/US news,Joe Biden warns Xi Jinping of ‘consequences’ if China backs Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/joe-biden-xi-jinping-call-china-russia-ukraine
3/19/2022,"In a career that spanned three continents and in the early 1990s included the editorship of the Daily Mirror, David Banks, who has died aged 74 of pneumonia, showed a flair for dealing with challenges. Though the business is renowned for cynicism, back-stabbing and disloyalty, he navigated his way through newsrooms around the world leaving nothing but friends in his wake. The episode that most severely tested the widespread good relations that “Banksy” enjoyed came when he left the Sun in 1985 as its assistant editor, apparently to spearhead the launch of Rupert Murdoch’s new London evening newspaper. He would be based in a new building in a part of the East End of London that few of us in the conference room for his send-off that evening had heard of, let alone visited. However, it proved to be an elaborate ruse. Within days David flew to New York for a crash course in producing newspapers using computer technology. Six months later, in January 1986, when the Sun, the News of the World, the Times and the Sunday Times decamped overnight to Wapping, David was there, ready to teach hundreds of confused journalists how to master screen-based writing and editing. He had not hinted to even his closest friends that he knew of, and would be a part of, the huge upheaval to come. Born in Warrington, Cheshire, David was the son of Helen (nee Renton) and Arthur Banks, a foreman at British Aluminium. He grew up on a council estate, and on leaving Boteler grammar school (now Sir Thomas Boteler Church of England high school) at the age of 16 he joined the Warrington Guardian. He took work – but not himself – seriously, a self-deprecating sense of humour being one of his greatest strengths. He had an instinctive skill for writing punchy, attention-grabbing headlines and being able to captivate an audience in the pub or the boardroom. His oversized character – at 6ft 5in tall, he was a substantial figure – secured moves from Warrington to the Journal, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then to the Daily Mirror’s Manchester operation. It did not take long for the Mirror’s head office to come calling, and he prospered in London as production editor. His friend and mentor Kelvin MacKenzie possessed an uncanny ability to spot talent. In 1979 he recruited David to join him at the New York Post, where he had been dispatched by Murdoch to introduce the US to Fleet Street-style tabloid journalism. As assistant managing editor, David helped energise a moribund newspaper, and when MacKenzie became editor of the Sun in 1981, David was not far behind, as night editor and later assistant editor. In the Bouverie Street newsroom it was daunting to be confronted by this giant of a man, your copy in his hand, as he needed the answer to a glaringly obvious mistake in the story – “Mate, mate, go back and ask him this” – but he rarely raged or yelled. His frustrations were only born of a determination to make the newspaper the best. He was the first to help reporters, particularly young ones, hone their craft. The Wapping revolution was a gruelling experience for journalists ferried in armoured buses past angry picket lines in and out of the News International compound every day. Whatever he may have felt personally, David was the ideal colleague for the moment, inexplicably breaking into the chorus from Oklahoma! during the darkest moments. As one of the few people to understand the new computer system, he was asked by the Sunday Times to help lay out pages. A headline was suggested but David could not make Trade Talks Falter on Great Wall of China fit the allotted space. Desperate to meet deadline, he summoned up his tabloid creativity, admitting that for one edition the headline memorably read Trade Talks Falter on Big Wall of China – one of the many stories he was happy to tell against himself. He also wrote a Saturday opinion column for the Sun – Banks of England. At the end of 1986 he left News International to join the New York Daily News. As deputy managing editor, in effect the No 3, he cast a huge shadow, literally and figuratively, over the newsroom in its celebrated East 42nd Street building. His task was to reinvigorate the News, his first edition hitting the streets with a front-page story about a gruesome murder, the headline CHOPPED TO PIECES printed at twice the newspaper’s traditional size. Pushing himself around the editorial floor on a roller chair, he urged the bemused staff to think bigger, bolder and brasher. While his Fleet Street stories and northern charisma left an impression still talked about when I became editor-in-chief of the News five years later, it was a brief and difficult marriage. He rejoined the Murdoch organisation in 1987, sent to be deputy editor of the Australian and then editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph-Mirror. He enjoyed six years of hard work in Australia, leavened by long family barbecues, and to many of us it seemed that he had found his natural home. In 1992 he returned to London as editor of the Daily Mirror, a newspaper that in many ways most naturally reflected his politics. David wanted the Mirror to return to its roots as a campaigning tabloid, dealing less with celebrity news, with a mission to help those with no voice. Sadly it proved a poisoned chalice, as cost-cutting was already eating away at national newspapers. Despite his physical presence, David was a sensitive man. He resented being instructed to cull staff and left the editor’s chair in 1994. After some less important roles at the Mirror Group, he reinvented himself as a radio host. From presenting LBC’s breakfast show (1997-99), he went to join his former newspaper colleague Nick Ferrari at Talk Radio (1999-2000), venting his feelings about politicians (for whom he had not a lot of regard), business moguls (even less) and celebrities (don’t ask). In recent years, suffering from ill health, he found that his career had come full circle as he wrote columns for his old Newcastle paper, the Journal (2006-15), and then a local news website, voiceofthenorth.net, from his home in the Northumberland village of Crookham. He was passionate about football, rugby and cricket. A keen guitarist, he loved music, particularly folk music, once playing live with Lindisfarne. In 1975 he married Gemma Newton, the sister of a friend. She survives him along with their son, Tim, daughter, Tash, and grandchildren, Logan, Tyga and Xander.

3/19/2022,"It feels very Disney+ to have Cheaper by the Dozen premiering on the company’s streaming service, Disney+, in 2022. The family film is the remake of a remake – the 2022 version puts a new spin on the 2003 movie of the same name, which updated the 1950 movie based on the the semi-autobiographical novel by siblings Frank Butler Gilbreth Jr and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey. It’s also potent nostalgia bait for young millennial parents; the 2003 version, starring Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents of 12 rowdy children, was a reliable (if tepidly reviewed) family-friendly staple of the 2000s whose brood contained a bevy of millennial-beloved stars – Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Tom Welling, Alyson Stoner. The 2022 version, directed by the Black-ish producer Gail Lerner from a script by the show’s creator, Kenya Barris, and writer/producer Jenifer Rice-Genzuk, makes several welcome updates to the formula of large family hijinks, but shares the 2003 film’s flat humor. There are too many moving parts to find a consistent groove; its tone wavers even more haphazardly from kids flick to marriage portrait to slapstick comedy to stark commentary on race, without nailing any particularly well and despite endearing commitment from its performers. The Disney+ version necessarily modernizes what had always been a uniformly white family at the center into a mixed group. In a cheesy but effectively succinct opening montage, Paul (Zach Braff) and Zoey Baker (Gabrielle Union), the interracial married co-runners of an all-day breakfast joint in Los Angeles, explain how their blended family came to be. Paul was married to the spacey, LA yoga girl Kate (Erika Christensen), with whom he had three kids (one, a child of South Asian descent named Haresh, played by Aryan Simhadri, was adopted as a baby). Zoey was married to NFL pro-bowler Dom (Timon Kyle Durrett), with whom she had two kids. Both marriages ended cheerily – “we agreed to close that chapter of our lives,” said twice – and Zoey and Paul fall in love at his diner. Two sets of twins later, the Bakers are up to nine kids. A foster situation – Paul’s sister, it’s mentioned with careful yet breezy sensitivity, goes to rehab, so the Bakers take in her (very lightly) troubled teenage son Seth (Luke Prael) – makes a full dozen. As with the 2003 film, the gist of Disney Plus’s remake is cheerful domestic chaos molded into light didacticism: the importance of the nuclear family (albeit a blended one, in this update) with reminders to not get blinded by financial success or the lure of growth. Paul decides to market his special sauce, and possibly franchise the restaurant, in order to help pay for a bigger home. The Bakers move from Echo Park, a middle-class neighborhood in LA proper, to Calabasas – “Kardashian country”, as one Instagram-savvy child puts it. The new mansion, bougie neighborhood and private school puts a strain on the family in obvious, predictable ways: eldest daughter Deja (Journee Brown, a standout among the ensemble), a basketball star, gets benched in favor of the teammate whose surname is on the gymnasium. The white country club parents do not take to Zoey, mistaking her as the nanny. The latter is one of several moments where the film seems unsure how it wants to handle the elephant in the room of racism. As a joke? (Zoey schooling a haughty, racist country club mom.) As a subtle condition to be addressed obliquely? (Paul telling Zoey, who feels out of place in Calabasas, that there are some places he doesn’t fit in, such as when she took him to a barber’s shop in Inglewood). As a teachable moment? (Dom, a black man skeptical of Paul, launches into a speech about how Paul will never be able to understand how it feels to be profiled by police, let alone prepare his black children for it.) All of the intentions are capital-G Good, all the politics and views firmly progressive, in a Disney sense, while being palatable. There is a utility for this, especially for young viewers, but the moralizing feels more like a brand straining to be correct rather than a family figuring things out. Still, some of the sillier material that’s painfully awkward for an adult viewer – Paul and Dom’s dance battle during Deja’s basketball game, Paul copping what he thinks is hip to impress younger potential investors – will probably play well for children, who enjoy TikTok dances and adults making fools of themselves. Braff and Union have passable chemistry, but Union’s charisma and confidence is magnetic in any context including this one. It’s all breezy – there are no bad actors or malicious intent (other than that one Calabasas woman), so the drama is light and the messes are quickly cleaned up. From an adult perspective, it seems unlikely that 2022’s Cheaper by the Dozen will engender the same loyalty as its predecessor, but who knows? Maybe in 2042, Gen Alpha parents will feel seen by Disney’s newest iteration of the Bakers.

3/19/2022,"The Metropolitan police will appeal against a high court ruling that they breached the rights of the organisers of a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in their handling of the event. The Met said it had “taken time to consider with great care the decision itself and the wider implications for policing” and planned to appeal against the ruling “to resolve what’s required by law when policing protests and events in the future”, in a statement published on Friday. The ruling last week was hailed as a “victory for women”. The four women who founded Reclaim These Streets had brought a legal challenge against the Met over its warning that they would face fines of £10,000 each and possible prosecution if the socially distanced event they were planning to mourn Everard and protest against violence against women went ahead. Instead, a spontaneous vigil and protest took place. Jessica Leigh, Anna Birley, Henna Shah and Jamie Klingler said that the force had breached their human rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and that it did not assess the potential risk to public health. Everard, 33, was murdered by a serving Met officer, Wayne Couzens. The vigil was to be held near to where she went missing in Clapham, south London, in March last year. The Met’s statement said: “It’s absolutely right that we are held to account for our actions and that there is proper scrutiny of the decisions we make as a police force in upholding legislation and maintaining public order. “We also respect the strong views held by Reclaim These Streets in defence of human rights and public protest, and their pursuit of justice for these views. “As an organisation we work with, support and police hundreds of protests and events across London every day, and take our responsibilities under the Human Rights Act in doing so very seriously.” On Friday night, Klingler condemned the force’s decision to appeal and urged it to “learn the law”. She wrote in a tweet: “I’m not going to pretend I am not furious. I was stood outside of Stoke Newington police station when I heard they filed permission to appeal. They want us to give up. They want to exhaust us. Fuck that. Learn the law.”",News/UK news,Met to appeal against ruling on handling of Sarah Everard vigil,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/met-to-appeal-against-ruling-on-handling-of-sarah-everard-vigil
3/19/2022,"Josh Frydenberg has flagged he is “open” to further market interventions making insurance more affordable, but says more preparatory work will need to be done before the Morrison government would extend its $10bn cyclone reinsurance pool in northern Australia to cover more natural disasters. In an interview with Guardian Australia ahead of the budget on 29 March, the treasurer said he was conscious that a changing climate rendered insurance problematic in some parts of Australia. Frydenberg said the cleanup after catastrophic flooding in New South Wales and Queensland would be a focal point in his pre-election economic statement. Asked whether he would extend the current reinsurance scheme in line with a recent call from the scheme’s principal architect, the veteran Liberal Warren Entsch, Frydenberg said: “There’s more work to be done.” “I’m open to finding ways to make insurance more accessible and affordable,” the treasurer said. “I’m conscious that many people in flood- and fire-prone zones are either underinsured or not insured at all because the cost of insurance can be prohibitively high.” Asked whether he was happy with the reinsurance model, which had been controversial with both the insurance sector and Australia’s consumer regulator before its ultimate adoption by the Coalition, Frydenberg said: “It’s early days but it’s been well received and there was a lot of work done. “But I’m not creating expectations. There are questions about how to make that workable, so we’ll have to get further work done.” Legislation giving effect to the current proposal, which covers cyclones and related flood damage, has already passed the House of Representatives and is expected to clear the Senate during budget week. The scheme is supposed to be operational by July. The current reinsurance pool model for cyclones and related flood damage covers residential, strata and small business property insurance policies in northern Australia. Entsch, the north Queensland MP, told Guardian Australia earlier this month recent disasters, including the recent floods, had made the case to apply the government guarantee more broadly a “no-brainer”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Morrison government is hoping the looming March budget will create a political springboard into the election the prime minister will call shortly after. A raft of polls suggest Labor would win an election held today. The economic statement is expected to contain cash payments providing cost-of-living relief for low and middle income earners, as well as spending on security and defence and on local manufacturing and regional infrastructure, including new hydrogen proposals for the energy transition. With fuel prices soaring, and other consumer prices on the rise, the government faces political pressure to assist households given wages growth is persistently sluggish. The government favours short-term cash payments to help with rising petrol and grocery prices in order to avoid building structural spending into the budget bottom line. Asked whether the Reserve Bank of Australia could lift interest rates while Australia was on an election footing, Frydenberg said that was ultimately a decision for the central bank. But he said the RBA, based on its public commentary, would be monitoring inflation and employment and looking for signs of wages growth before increasing the official cash rate. With the latest labour force statistics confirming Australia’s unemployment rate fell to 4% in February, down from 4.2% in January and its lowest level since 2008, the government will attempt to engage disadvantaged and disengaged young Australians in labour market readiness programs. The budget will contain a $46.8m pre-employment program for people between the ages of 15 and 24. The government says the program will provide community-focused interventions including training and work experience. In another pre-budget announcement, the government has also earmarked about $75m in additional support for travel agents and tour providers, following pandemic-related disruptions. The tourism minister, Dan Tehan, said the targeted program would “support travel agents and tour arrangement service providers to meet ongoing costs of running outlets, continue to process rebookings and provide high-quality customer service to their customers”. Asked whether the government was serious about moving past fiscal support for businesses hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic even if new variants necessitated a public health response – a position Frydenberg has publicly signalled – he said the days of “large economy-wide-scale support has ended”.",News/Australia news,Josh Frydenberg open to intervening in insurance market as climate change pushes up premiums,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/josh-frydenberg-open-to-intervening-in-insurance-market-as-climate-change-pushes-up-premiums
3/19/2022,"Fifty years ago, at a rowdy meeting at the Hobart town hall, the world’s first “green” party was formed. While the word Green was not officially used, and it would take some time for the United Tasmania Group to be formally registered as a political party, it was the beginning of an organised effort to use the political system to push for a spotlight on environmental issues. The UTG was born of a desire to stop the state’s powerful Hydro Electric Commission from flooding pristine Lake Pedder, in the state’s rugged south-west wilderness. And, for that fight, the UTG deserves formal recognition as the first green political party to contest an election anywhere in the world. Both the Labor and Liberal parties were committed to the Hydro’s policy of damming every wild river in the state to generate cheap electricity. The fight for Lake Pedder had been brewing ever since the Menzies government funded a road cut into the south-west wilderness, putting conservationists on high alert. There was nothing quite like Pedder anywhere – a glacial outwash Lake, with a mile-long beach of pink quartzite sand, and a dozen endemic species. The natural wonder came to be recognised nationally and internationally. Compounding the sense of grief and outrage, the dam made no economic sense: Tassie had enough power and the Hydro was only proposing to use the Lake as dead water storage. At a Hobart exhibition by the passionate nature photographer Olegas Truchanas – simply slides of his pictures of Pedder, set to the music of Sibelius – people walked out in tears. Dr Richard Jones, a former vice-president of the Queensland Country Party, was a botanical scientist who moved to the University of Tasmania in 1970. After visiting Pedder he began working with the Lake Pedder Action Committee. For Jones, Pedder was symptomatic of a wider problem. As he wrote in one 1971 lecture: “Concern for the environment is completely unrepresented in our governments.” One of the original campaigners, geomorphologist Kevin Kiernan, described Jones as one of the most strategic thinkers he had ever met – a real “chess master”. In Sydney, Milo Dunphy had been the first dedicated conservationist to run for parliament in Australia, contesting the New South Wales state election in 1971. Dunphy joined the Lake Pedder campaign and, after twice visiting Tasmania, wrote heartfelt letters to Rupert Murdoch’s The Australian calling for the flooding to be halted. Dunphy, Jones and Kiernan were constantly in touch by letter. In February 1972, Dunphy got word that the sole Centre party member of the Tasmanian parliament, Kevin Lyons, was about to cross the floor, robbing the Bethune Liberal government of its single-seat majority and almost certainly forcing an election. The Colong Committee, which Dunphy was a member of, minuted plans to run “total environment” candidates in Tasmania, and Dunphy announced that the Lake Pedder Action Committee would fly him down to Hobart to help run the campaign. When the election was called, a meeting was scheduled at the Hobart town hall for 23 March, with ads running in the Mercury featuring the stylised triangles – representing the saw-toothed “mega-ripples” of the lake’s edge – that would become the logo of the new UTG. Jones and his mates had word that the Hydro had planned to stack the hall with 200 engineers. And there was plenty of rowdy and fiery debate that evening. But eventually, there was support for the landmark resolution: “In order that there is a maximum usage of a unique political opportunity to save Lake Pedder … there be formed a Single Independent Coalition of primarily conservation-oriented candidates”. The coalition was called the United Tasmania Group, and its first campaign was under way. The UTG may have had no candidates elected in 1972 – in the four seats they contested, they averaged 4.9% of the vote – and they did not direct preferences (Jones believed neither major party deserved them). The Bethune government was punished for instability, and Labor’s “Electric” Eric Reece was returned in a landslide. And there was no reprieve for Lake Pedder and it was flooded. A rearguard action by the Whitlam Labor government, led by environment minister Moss Cass, who hoped to reverse the flooding and restore it, proved too little, too late. But the UTG refused to give up on Pedder, keeping up pressure over the Lake, formally establishing itself as a political party and fleshed out a policy platform which was bursting with new ideas for the future of the state. In 1975 a young doctor from NSW who had moved to Launceston, Bob Brown, inspired and mentored by Jones, ran second to him on the UTG’s Senate ticket. The following year a handful of mostly UTG members gathered for a strategy meeting at Brown’s house in Liffey Falls, resolving to form the Wilderness Society andcampaign for conservation using non-violent direct action. Brown would lead the Wilderness Society to a spectacular win in the Franklin Dam campaign, after the Hawke Labor government delivered on a promise to save the wild river in the lead-up to the 1983 election. Brown sat for the next decade as spiritual leader of a growing number of green-minded independents in Tasmania and around the country. He would go on to co-found the Australian Greens in 1992 and then represent the party in the Senate from 1998 until 2012. The UTG petered out after a disappointing result at the 1977 elections, although it has since been revived. The party may not have led directly to the formation of the Australian Greens – activist movements for the environment, social justice and peace had to coalesce before that would become possible, and that process would take 20 years. But there is no doubt that the seed of a new green political party was sown in the Hobart town hall in March 1972 when a few hundred people resolved overwhelmingly that no existing party would do enough to confront an environmental crisis, looming even then, or just as importantly save Lake Pedder and its pink sandy beach … which remains intact, submerged, 50 years later.",News/Australia news,How the fight to save Tasmania’s Lake Pedder led to the world’s first green party,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/how-the-fight-to-save-tasmanias-lake-pedder-led-to-the-worlds-first-green-party
3/19/2022,"It feels more than uncomfortable to be writing a column about a woman who died suddenly just over a week ago at the age of 52. Uncomfortable because the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching is no longer here to exercise the judgments that inevitably shape how, when and on what terms her story is told. Other players featuring in the reported cameos of Kitching’s last months in public life also feel constrained in how they respond, either out of self-preservation, or because contesting the recollections and confidences of a recently deceased woman feels unseemly. But Kitching’s allies and many friends are mourning with the visceral grief that accompanies a sudden and terrible loss – and they are talking. Anthony Albanese has spent a chunk of this past week trying to nudge Labor past the controversy. But Kitching’s supporters have made it clear to colleagues they don’t appreciate others mandating ground rules for how and when the late senator’s life should be discussed. There has been internal umbrage about policing the terms of the discussion. The tussle over Kitching’s story, and who can assert the right to tell it, speaks to the corrosive impact of power plays, second guessing and mistrust in professional politics. If you’ve imbibed the dominant media narrative of the week, you’ll have read that Kitching was allegedly bullied and ostracised in the months leading up to her death by the “mean girls” of Labor’s Senate leadership team: Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher. On Friday, the three issued a joint statement flatly denying that bullying had occurred. If you are reading some of the coverage on the fly, you might gain an impression that Kitching was helpless in the face of arbitrary bitchy hostility – something of a victim. I wasn’t a media intimate of the late Victorian senator, but this characterisation doesn’t really capture the person. Kitching, in my observation, was formidable. It’s why she was widely respected. Highly intelligent, charming and shrewd, she was a power player in every sense of that word – an experienced factional operator and a consummate networker, entirely fluent in the blood sport of Victorian Labor politics. To imply otherwise is a disservice to truth. It robs Kitching of agency, and reduces a talented and complex woman to the role of untethered ghost in a history war. But people are complicated and contradictory creatures. Like any human, she could also be vulnerable, and Kitching’s friends and allies insist she was isolated and ostracised by some of her Labor colleagues – a trend that intensified in the months before her untimely death. She raised this with a number of people. Some of the underlying friction, I suspect, was caused by basic philosophical differences. Kitching was, by disposition, a cold war Catholic, an anti-communist hawk. Once upon a time, the Labor party used to brim with cold war Catholics, but these days most of them have migrated to the Liberal party. The centre of gravity in modern Labor is post-material progressive, not conservative. Some of Kitching’s political and policy instincts – and she was ambitious and self-confident enough to pursue them whether that was convenient for senior people or not – went against the grain. In the way of politics, some internal battles were overt, some subterranean. Then there was her modus operandi. Kitching maintained a substantial personal network outside her own tribe. She cultivated friendships with political opponents, and pursued relationships with commentators and journalists on her own terms. Kitching roamed regularly and widely outside the chain of command, gathering and sharing information. The substantial footprint of her extensive network can be measured in the tone and scale of eulogising after her death, and in some of the media narratives of this past week. Cultivating personal networks is hardly a crime against the Labor party. It’s smart and entirely proper for politicians to build the coalitions they need to advance the greater good, or to further their own career interests. Everyone in politics does this to a greater or lesser extent. But given Canberra has become more hierarchal, pugilistic and tribal over the 20-plus years I’ve been ringside, Kitching’s independence generated suspicion from some colleagues. There were significant trust issues, and they triggered periodic confrontations that Kitching doubtless found very bruising. We also need to surface another largely undeclared dynamic lurking behind this story. Persisting with hierarchies and tribes, the alleged “mean girls” – Wong, Keneally and Gallagher – are all close to each other, and to Anthony Albanese. Kitching’s most significant and enduring relationship in public life was with the former Labor leader Bill Shorten, a mate who brought her into parliament in 2016. Shorten waited with her husband, Andrew Landeryou, after Kitching died in her car last Friday. The thought of that vigil is gut wrenchingly sad. It’s fair to say Albanese and Shorten are not close, and in the piranha pen of politics, behaviours of principals and surrogates are always parsed to the nth degree. Politics is inherently a high-conflict, low-trust environment, and non-conforming behaviour is routinely interpreted as provocative proxy warring, whether it is or not. Often these interpretations are correct, because politics is studded with corrosively ambitious people playing constant three-dimensional chess. These people also know each other’s habits intimately, because most of them have been jousting and jockeying among themselves since they were adolescents. But sometimes the paranoia that builds up in the Canberra cloisters colours interpretation. In these cases, innocent forays are assigned greater meaning. In any case, Kitching’s death, and the roiling around it, has exposed a rupture that persists in Labor after the trauma of losing the so-called unlosable 2019 election. What the past 10 years tells us is Australia’s major parties lack the collective emotional intelligence, the quality of mercy or, frankly, the rudimentary human resources capability, to deal cathartically and productively with the fallout of leadership transitions, whether they are managed or regicidal. Given these transitions now happen at pace, this presents a significant problem. One last relevant factor is Kitching’s preselection. Anxiety about that was supercharging some of the tensions. At the moment, the national executive is calling the shots with Victorian preselections, because a branch-stacking scandal precipitated a federal intervention in the branch. Because the left faction has the numbers on the national executive, Kitching was rendered vulnerable in the event frenemies in the right suddenly decided she was surplus to requirements and someone else was owed a prize. Kitching’s right faction in Victoria is also in flux because the scandal triggered a realignment in the power blocs. So there was certainly active speculation around about her future. The sum of these parts lead inexorably to this conclusion: Kitching was under significant professional stress at the time of her passing. Now stress tends to go with the territory in politics. People experience it themselves, and they inflict it on others. But Kitching’s personal triggers – feeling isolated in Canberra, and deprived of the comfort of a stable power base in Melbourne – overlapped and intersected. On the flipside of this terribly sad human story are Kitching’s colleagues, another bunch of complicated humans, who reacted to what they regarded as disloyalty and internecine brinkmanship at the expense of the current leadership both in the Senate and the party – with an election in sight that none of these people want to lose. My point here is simple. Conflicts are always plural. There is never just one perspective, and suffice to say, all of that is one a hell of a brew. This is fundamentally a story about politics, and the way politics is practised in contemporary times. The story isn’t pretty because the arena can be hostile to humans. Politics needs a culture correction. The way many politicians conduct themselves – the way power is routinely exercised, through rolling cycles of provocations and punishments, the gaslighting and the reverse gaslighting – would not be tolerated in other professional workplaces. Brutality – both dished out and returned – is normalised as the “rough and tumble” of politics. People don’t ask themselves often enough whether this culture needs to be the default. The Jenkins review, triggered by more sad stories than I have strength to tell you about – some that have been told, and some that will never be told – found that power imbalances and misuse of power were primary drivers of a toxic culture, and the media are certainly not blameless here. For anyone who cares about the health of Australian democracy, that insight about abuses of power in the political ecosystem is the key takeout of the past 12 months, and it should remain front of mind. If we care about our collective future, we might want to experiment with something a bit more nourishing and soulful and sustainable than “whatever it takes”, and “what goes around, comes around”.",News/Australia news,Kimberley Kitching’s death and its aftermath are another glimpse into the routine brutality of Australian politics,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/mar/19/kimberley-kitchings-death-and-its-aftermath-are-another-glimpse-into-the-routine-brutality-of-australian-politics
3/19/2022,"For the second time in a month the Andrews government this week unfurled a big social reform to be funded by a levy on business. And for the second time in a month, it provoked outrage from the usual quarters, including the state opposition, the federal government and industry groups. But whereas February’s attempt to introduce a developer levy to pay for social housing was quashed within 10 days, the electoral politics of paid sick leave for casuals will be very different. In announcing the $246m two-year trial of paid sick leave, the premier, Daniel Andrews, said the pandemic had exposed the “completely and utterly toxic” nature of insecure work. Some casuals were forced to choose between going to work while infected with Covid, he said, putting their colleagues at risk; or feeding their families, given they couldn’t afford to call in sick. The trial will mean about 150,000 eligible casual and contract workers will receive up to five days a year of sick or carer’s pay each year at the national minimum wage, or about $772.60 a week. More than 2,000 people have already signed up, with 600 of them approved for the scheme so far. But like clockwork, industry groups released statements criticising the proposal, the federal industrial relations minister, Michaelia Cash, described it as a “tax on jobs and a handbrake on our economy”, and the state opposition indicated it could scrap the trial if elected in November. Much of the criticism centred upon Andrews’ comments made in an interview with Guardian Australia, during which he confirmed that while the government was paying for the trial, any ongoing scheme would be funded by an industry levy. “It’s not a matter of, ‘can business afford to support this?’ It’s a question of, ‘can all of us afford not to do this’,” he said. Andrews was unapologetic about targeting taxes at specific groups in order to fund his reform agenda. This is despite his government, just days before the interview, was forced to dump another levy that would’ve slugged developers to fund new social housing. While Andrews will tell you the backdown had nothing to do with backlash from industry, the proposal had many within Labor’s ranks panicked. It would’ve ultimately meant first-home buyers in outer suburbs (read: Labor voters) would’ve had to pay more for their property. It handed the opposition a golden opportunity to target the government in its heartland over housing affordability. They had already begun calling it a “housing tax”. The sick leave trial, however, has the support of the unions and a huge cohort of Labor voters. “It speaks to the young inner-urban professional, it speaks to the young person that is working in hospitality as they study to get another job, the mum who works casual shifts, or the migrants in the outer suburbs who have only ever known casual employment or temporary contract work,” said Kosmos Samaras, a former Labor campaign strategist turned pollster. “The electoral politics of it is quite profound.” Samaras said research conducted by his firm RedBridge before the pandemic had found casual workers were a growing constituency. In 2019, there were more than 650,000 casual workers in Victoria. In 2021 it dipped to about 600,000. “It’s a real generational divide. For anyone under the age of 50, they at some time in their life have worked in a casual job and even if they have moved on, they are empathetic to those workers,” he said. There is also a generational divide when it comes to support for Andrews. The latest Roy Morgan poll, conducted in November 2021, showed approval of Andrews’ handling of his job is heavily correlated to age. A large majority of young Victorians aged under 35 (72%) approve of his handling of the job, compared with only 28% who disapprove. This approval declines progressively with age: 62.5% of those aged 35-49 and 61% of those aged 50-64 approve of Andrews’ handling of the job, while this drops to only 55% of people aged 65 and older. A Newspoll conducted that same month showed women aged under 34 were most likely to approve of his pandemic performance while men 65 and older were most likely to disapprove. Andrews knows that in order to hold on to as many seats as possible at the next election, he needs to keep young people on side. While the social housing levy is scrapped, his government will need to do more to address housing affordability. Much has also been made of Andrews’ comments that the “great Australian dream” of owning a home is less important to younger generations. He said some young people he knows would prefer to rent in a location that suits their lifestyle rather than buy in an area they can afford, so long as they have secure terms. This may be true for some. But for others, home ownership is not less important, rather, it’s unattainable.",Global,Victorian politics of paid sick leave is very different to developer levies,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/mar/19/victorian-politics-of-paid-sick-leave-is-very-different-to-developer-levies
3/19/2022,"Joanne Moody fell asleep to the sound of steady rain on a tin roof. When she got out of bed, Moody’s legs – “very unexpectedly” – sank knee-deep in water. On that night of 25 February, the nearby creek burst its banks and water rose through her corrugated-iron cabin in the woods of Beerwah, near the Glass House Mountains, in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. The events that followed would result in Moody becoming one of the thousands of Queenslanders displaced by widespread flooding – a disaster that’s thrown them at the mercy of a housing market already in the grips of crisis. It is a crisis that urgently demanded a government response on the magnitude of the one Covid triggered, says the St Vincent de Paul state chief, Kevin Mercer. Mercer says the charity was seeing several hundred people seek assistance every week – a number he said was growing on a daily basis. He says his organisation is working on an estimate that 20,000 homes are affected by flooding, over an area that sprawled from Gympie south to the Gold Coast and into New South Wales. “When you look at it in the context of housing, that’s 20,000 that need housing on top of the 50,000 people we already had on the housing waiting list before the floods.” Mercer says. “So these things are just compounding into a housing crisis that we already had.” Mercer says drastic action is needed to give tens of thousands of Queenslanders hope. But more on hope later. Because last month, as the flood waters swirled around her, Moody was not afforded the luxury of thinking about the long term. She shoved some valuables on high shelves, grabbed her phone and waded – barefoot through waist-deep water in only the T-shirt and shorts in which she had slept. Even her wallet was left behind. When she opened the front door, the water gushed in to even higher levels. Soon, SES volunteers arrived on a boat to rescue Moody and the family who owned the Beerwah property on which she rented. A whirlwind of events followed. The owner of her property paid for an Airbnb, the proprietor of which donated clothing. After two nights, the property owner drove Moody 30 minutes up the Bruce Highway to Nambour. “She left and I was there with a bag of clothes, not quite knowing where to go,” Moody says. “So I rang the homeless line.” They directed her to a flood evacuation centre, where a charity worker drove her 20 minutes back down the Bruce to another centre at a university in Sippy Downs. Another night passed and she was driven south again, almost back to Beerwah, to stay at a Landsborough motel, courtesy of Vinnies. Nothing of much financial value remains at the cabin. Some possessions could be salvaged. Quilts her mother made, her dad’s old watch – mementoes of parents now passed. The Seagull cherry oak guitar she has lugged around with her for years. Cook books, which helped inspire a career change to cheffing after more than a decade working in child protection. A laptop. Other belongings are wrecked. Her car. The washing machine and fridge. The laptop charger. Her record collection, including special-edition Pearl Jam and Jeff Buckley albums. Journals and notes from her 47 years of life. “It was only observational stuff, there wasn’t anything of great, Nobel prize-winning literature,” Moody says. “In a way it was refreshing, to wipe the slate clean.” Moody is similarly philosophical about the institutional response to the flood. She received a text with a general flood warning, but the rain fell inconsistently in the days prior. So when Moody went to bed that night, she was totally unprepared for the life-threatening situation to which she would wake. The speed at which the SES responded was “pretty impressive”. The neighbours, “God love ’em”, provided a hot shower and a cuppa. “In that emergency stage of a flood, people respond to what people need immediately: food, water, clothing,” she says. “Clothes are definitely not a problem in a flood, let me tell ya.” But despite everything she has already been through, the greatest uncertainties for Moody lie ahead. She is in motel room, paid for less than a fortnight. “I’m not too sure what will happen after that,” she says. “I’m looking for properties but nothing has come up yet.” Others displaced by the floods are relying on family or friends for emergency accommodation. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority says it finished this week assessing 16,500 homes and commercial buildings, of which nearly half were flood-affected. The number of people affected, however, is likely to be higher than the number of homes. Ellen Loeffel, 25, and her doberman, Xena, are now living downstairs in a friend’s Queenslander in Brisbane’s inner-northern suburb of Albion. She too speaks about the rapidity with which her life changed. For her it was on the last Sunday of February. “I was keeping an eye on the water in the back yard,” Loeffel says. “I went outside to check – and suddenly the water was in the house.” Loeffel had enough time to carry the TV upstairs and get out with a bag of clothes and her dog. She has been crashing with a friend since. She plans on moving back in, but the owners need to wait for an insurance assessment before renovations can start. While she lost most of her possessions, she’s OK. She owns a place in Ipswich and rents in Brisbane to be closer to her work as a personal trainer. Mercer says the crisis demanded a suite of short-term responses. Holiday rentals should house flood evacuees. Commonwealth rent assistance needed to be indexed to property prices. Welfare support should match the soaring cost of food and fuel. The National Rental Affordability Scheme needed to be retained, not scrapped. But, ultimately, the crisis demanded a long-term commitment to build “serious numbers of social and affordable housing stock”, Mercer says. “We are talking tens of billions of dollars. We really need a broader vision, not just a reactive response, because a lot of people are feeling quite hopeless. They need a vision and they need hope.”",News/Australia news,‘I rang the homeless line’: How Queensland’s floods compounded a housing crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/i-rang-the-homeless-line-how-queenslands-floods-compounded-a-housing-crisis
3/19/2022,"Kevin “Rusty” Adams’ home flooded in 2011, in 2017, and again in 2022. He has lived in Brisbane’s Paddington area his entire life – and no flood is going to drive him from the community or his home in the low-lying area near Rosalie Village. “That’s a daunting thought,” Rusty said, when asked if he’d ever considered leaving. “I’ve got four other brothers who live up the coast and they want me to move up. But this is where I live.” In the aftermath of the floods that hit Queensland and northern NSW this month, some communities are reckoning with a harsh and climate-fuelled reality: that their homes may become uninsurable or even uninhabitable. Some are questioning whether to rebuild. Others have called for property buybacks. There has also been plenty of commentary about the need for “climate resilience”, without much – if any – detail about what that term really means. Rusty said that to understand climate resilience, take a look at his place. About a year ago, as part of a Brisbane city council program to help renovate flood-prone homes, the ground-floor unit was retrofitted to cope with inundation. Skirting boards were replaced with wall tiles up to the highest level defined in the council’s flood mapping. Waterproof kitchen and bathroom cabinets were installed. After the worst flood Rusty could remember came through, he lost some property, but was able to quickly clean up his place and keep living in the unit. “Because of the way they’d tiled the place I was able to put a hose right through my unit,” he said. “Really there was no structural damage to my place at all, because of the work these guys did. “The guy next door in unit two, beside me, he’s only a renter, he’d only been there for three or four weeks and he got done over. The drains just couldn’t handle it, on top of that we had a river coming down [the street].” As the floodwaters came through Brisbane’s older suburbs, the city’s traditional homes – Queenslanders and workers cottages – were in many cases able to allow water to flow underneath the floorboards. But in recent decades, many people have built rooms underneath these old homes, sometimes raising the old part of the house to allow for a more modern open-plan-living style. Planning rules in Brisbane do not require a development application to build within the existing envelope of a home; and the “build-under” has allowed many people to add bedrooms – and value – to their property at relatively low cost. “You can make relatively large increases in size quite quickly by building underneath [the house],” said John Macarthur, a professor of architecture at the University of Queensland. “There are a lot of structural issues behind this, but the principle one is land value – it’s just skyrocketed. “Banks and financial institutions will instruct people to capitalise their property at a certain rate. The more land prices go up, the more expensive the buildings have to be, and that’s expressed in size, numbers of rooms, number of car spaces, a lot of things that don’t fit on the lot the house was built for.” Architect James Davidson, whose practice specialises in climate adaptation and flood resilience, has been working with Brisbane council on a flood resilient homes program for the past few years. He oversaw the renovation of Rusty’s place. The traditional design of the Queenslander is “not really supportive of family living,” Davidson said. “The idea of having a separate living room, a separate kitchen, that’s sort of gone out the window. When it comes to Queenslanders, a lot of clients want to put kitchen and living area on the ground level, next to their backyard,” he said. “The problem we have is that the original Queenslander was built well above a flood line. Building underneath is an affordable approach for a lot of families. “I’m not that critical of people who build in under, because subconsciously … we think the hard infrastructure will save us. It’s a reminder we can’t trust dams, we can’t trust drainage and pipes. “So we need to look at accepting water and living with water and making it simple to recover from events like the one we’ve just had.” So what does “resilience” – this catch-all term tossed about frequently in recent weeks – actually look like? Some talk about raising dams and levees and home buybacks. But in the face of climate change, Davidson said it has to mean more than just physical adaptation. “Resilience is about community, it’s not about the house,” he said. “If the asset is good at protecting itself, then the broader thing [is] about being able to assist your community quicker. It’s not about the house at all, it’s about people. “All councils around the country that are affected by flooding recognise the legacy issue. I don’t blame anybody, nobody predicted we would be facing this level of climate change so quickly – I was personally expecting it to happen another 20 or 30 years. “There’s legacy issues about developing on a floodplain in the first place. But people don’t want to leave, they really don’t. Talks about buybacks are fraught with emotional drama. It’s problematic. We’re displacing community.” Davidson said buybacks would need to happen in the longer term – that properties that were acquired could then be used for water flow or retention to mitigate damage at those that remain. “It needs some thought and an understanding that it’s not just about homes, it’s about livelihoods, economies, culture and education for kids.” In the meantime, homes could be built or renovated like Rusty’s – using materials that won’t be damaged by floodwaters and can be easily cleaned – so floods don’t displace people in the longer term. Davidson said it was easy to criticise people who buy or build in a flood zone “when you’re not the one being affected”. “How do you displace an entire community without losing your sense of belonging?” he said. “It’s a big conversation that has to be had [about buybacks and climate resilience], but it needs to happen with a bit of thought, a bit of sensitivity.”",News/Australia news,‘Build-under’: the impacts of renovating the traditional 'Queenslander',https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/as-floods-worsen-some-say-it-is-time-to-rethink-how-queenslanders-build-for-the-future
3/19/2022,"State elections are not always of great interest to people beyond the borders, but today’s South Australian poll is getting more attention than usual as it comes in the lead-up to the May federal election. The latest poll shows Labor poised to tip out the Marshall government after just one term in power. It shows a swing of about 8%, putting Labor ahead 56 to 44 on a two-party preferred score. That election-winning lead is slightly bigger than the one federal Labor currently enjoys over the Coalition. Premier Steven Marshall’s government is clinging to minority power with just 22 seats of 47 in the House of Assembly after three of his MPs quit to join the crossbench. Labor holds 19 and there are six independents in the mix. Haydon Manning, an adjunct associate professor in politics, policy and global affairs at Flinders University, says there are many unknowns about the SA election outcome, and even more about what it might mean federally. He says it’s unusually hard to predict. That’s partly because of the polling – pollsters adjusted their methods after predicting a federal Labor win in 2019. It’s also because the swings are never uniform across the board. Each electorate – even each booth – can be swayed by hyperlocal issues. “The consensus is clearly that it’s with Labor. But do we believe the margin’s as big as it is?” Manning said. “It’s really hard to read.” Marshall and his Labor opponent, Peter Malinauskas, had a busy final day of campaigning on Friday. Marshall faced questions about his decision to open the then Covid-free state’s borders in November – he opened them in time for Christmas, knowing the pandemic would follow. The state was then hit with a wave of Omicron that saw many having to isolate for the festive season. “There’s no doubt that many businesses, many individuals have made sacrifices … but those sacrifices have kept our state safe and kept our economy strong,” he told the ABC. Malinauskas has attacked the government over ambulance ramping, a highly visible and highly emotive outward sign of trouble inside hospitals, and an issue that is dominating talkback radio. The government has attacked Malinauskas for only releasing Labor’s costings on Thursday, while spruiking its own economic credentials and talking up new investment in space and cutting edge technologies. The pair have bickered about costings of their policies, each accusing the other of lacking credibility. Local issues such as swimming pools, public transport and development decisions can swing different seats, and bigger pledges such as Labor’s bringing back the Adelaide 500 supercar race could be a winner in some seats and a loser in others. Marshall’s signature announcement was a $662 million city entertainment arena, Malinauskas pledged a $593 million hydrogen power plant. Manning says there are different concerns at a state level, but that it is clear any kudos leaders won from keeping Australia relatively safe in the pandemic has dissipated. That applies at both state and federal levels, he says. He quotes Labor veteran Geoff Anderson, who said “voters tend to say thank you for what you’ve done … but ask what are you going to do now?”. He believes Malinauskas’s success in the polls comes from the opposition leader’s focus on what he is going to do, as opposed to Marshall relying on what he has already done. Meanwhile, any predictions for the May election are made more complicated by a broader acceptance of debt and deficit in the wake of government pandemic spending. It’s also not clear how global insecurity will affect incumbency. However the votes fall, there is unlikely to be a result by Saturday night. More than 172,000 South Australians have cast an early vote, and more than 162,000 have cast a postal vote. With a voting population of about 1,267,000, that means about a quarter of the votes won’t be counted until the counting of Saturday’s votes are done. And if it’s a hung parliament and either side has to woo those independents, it might take even longer.",News/Australia news,‘Hard to read’: Labor is clear favourite in South Australia’s election – but local issues muddy the waters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/hard-to-read-labor-is-clear-favourite-in-south-australias-election-but-local-issues-muddy-the-waters
3/19/2022,"It’s hard to imagine many inside the New South Wales government were particularly upset with veteran Nationals backbencher Geoff Provest when he aimed both barrels at the prime minister over his response to the state’s flood disaster this week. Hardly the state government’s most prominent attack dog, Provest did not miss in his assessment of Scott Morrison after his north coast electorate of Tweed was inexplicably excluded from extra disaster funding announced by the prime minister last week. The decision was “deplorable”, Provest said, adding that he was personally “disgusted with the prime minister” and would struggle to vote for him at the upcoming federal election. “There’s a real venom out there directed at the prime minister that he doesn’t understand what’s occurring on the ground,” he told ABC radio. The backstory, if you missed it, was that when Morrison announced extra disaster funding payments for flood-affected individuals last week, it was restricted to areas surrounding Lismore, the Richmond Valley and Clarence Valley. All of them are in the federal seat of Page, held by the Nationals. Coincidentally, the areas excluded - Tweed, Ballina and Byron - all happened to be in the federal seat of Richmond, held by Labor. By Thursday afternoon the feds had backflipped, with minister for emergency management, Bridget McKenzie, announcing that following an assessment by the National Recovery and Resilience Agency the grants would be extended across the north of the state. But the saga fit neatly with the now-familiar impression of the Morrison government as either missing in action during a crisis, or else obsessed with creating political advantage wherever possible. “This is like a remake of the bushfires,” Provest helpfully added. Which, for the NSW government, may be the perfect comparison point – in that it’s a low bar that’s easy to outperform. It’s been clear this week that the state Coalition is keen to distance itself from its federal counterparts, with reports suggesting that senior NSW government MPs were frustrated with Canberra delaying new support packages - something Morrison denied - and that requests for Australian defence force support were ignored. It’s not a new dynamic. In a speech to economics thinktank CEDA last month, Perrottet joked about his frequent run-ins with the federal government, saying he had “got myself in trouble going after the commonwealth government at points in time”. “I’ve promised the prime minister I will deal with him via text message [rather than] through a public forum,” he quipped. More recently, the treasurer, Matt Kean, has taken on that role, criticising the federal government for failing to provide business support during Omicron, clashing with the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and suggesting that he supported a federal Icac. But it’s a particularly useful tactic when NSW’s own flood response has not been without fault, including revelations the State Emergency Service had warned about the impact of budget cuts on its capability in the northern rivers and questions about what exactly it is Resilience NSW does with its $1.4bn budget. Indeed, a year out from the next state election, things are hardly running smoothly in Macquarie Street. The government is grappling with a protracted industrial dispute with the state’s rail union, and knows more is coming down the line as teachers’ and nurses’ unions flex their muscles in a bid to do away with the increasingly controversial 2.5% wage cap on public sector workers. Add to that the ballooning costs on its centrepiece infrastructure commitments, teacher shortages and increasingly regular grants scandals, and it’s little wonder MPs such as Catherine Cusack and Don Harwin are headed for the exit. But unlike Morrison – who seems preternaturally inclined to perceived gaffes during emergencies – Perrottet’s response to the floods has been both pragmatic and (it feels weird to have to write this as a point of contrast to other politicians) human. He spent a significant amount of time in the flood-affected areas immediately following the disaster, while acknowledging the shortcomings of the response and quickly announcing a review into why so many people had been left to fend for themselves. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And the relief packages announced by his government – such as the rental support announced last week – have won him some unlikely friends during the crisis. “I’m not a natural ally to the ultra-right wing of the Liberal party, but he’s been amazing,” the Ballina Greens MP, Tamara Smith, said this week. “He hasn’t been playing politics, which is refreshing. I think there is a real intention and will to do the right thing.” Which isn’t a blank cheque, of course. Smith also questioned Resilience NSW’s capacity to actually deliver support into the affected communities, and noted that the real “danger zone” would come in a few months’ time when the news cycle had moved on. But as politics in NSW enters an unofficial shutdown while Perrottet takes parental leave and the opposition steps back to give free air to its federal colleagues ahead of a likely election in May, the NSW government can be satisfied that, the more it is held up against the Coalition in Canberra, the better it looks.",News/Australia news,"Against the foil of the Morrison government, Dominic Perrottet’s flood response has been pragmatic",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/against-the-foil-of-the-morrison-government-dominic-perrottets-flood-response-has-been-pragmatic
3/19/2022,"Many Australians have little pause to deeply consider their interactions with police. But for many First Nations families, interactions with police and the judicial system are imbued with violent and often deadly experiences handed down through the generations and correspondingly documented by the white state. A critical final finding of the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project – that half the massacres of Aboriginal people on the Australian frontier were carried out by government forces, including police – reinforces how contemporary Indigenous deaths at the hands of state law enforcement agencies are part of a history of violence that began with European invasion in 1788. Memories of terrible massacres perpetrated by police on the colonial and postcolonial frontier remain at the forefront of the sensibilities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Until recently the survivors of some of the most brutal attacks were still alive; the Central Land Council’s remarkable Every Hill Got a Story project documents the disturbing first-hand oral accounts of some, including the 1928 Coniston massacre in the Northern Territory. Is it any wonder, then, given the frontier experience and the ongoing shame of Aboriginal deaths in custody, that so many First Nations people harbour a deep suspicion and fear of police. Non-Indigenous Australians should dwell on this as they contemplate the latest findings of the massacre map. Denial – of the collective conscience, of national misdeeds of the past – is succoured by wilful ignorance. Knowledge and understanding are the fuel of ongoing reckoning. And reckoning is at the heart of the massacre map project. Part of that reckoning is understanding that some police forces have at their genesis a purpose to “disperse” (a genteel white frontier euphemism, along with “tranquilise”) the troublesome “native” or “aborigine”. Take the New South Wales mounted police unit, established in 1825 by the then colonial governor, Thomas Brisbane, after the Bathurst wars with the Wiradjuri to further quell Aboriginal resistance. You will struggle to find mention of that in the proud NSW police writing of its history. But the state mounted police involvement in the notorious Waterloo Creek massacre of 1838 and numerous other orchestrated killings is firmly established history with a disturbing resonance for some Aboriginal people (and their defenders). The Northern Territory police has its own shameful history of acute violence against Aboriginal people that manifests in the profound contempt many NT Indigenous people have for the force. Some individual NT police – beginning with Paul Foelsche – stand out for their barbarity and for the historical stain their actions bequeathed to the NT mounted police (which evolved into the territory’s chief law enforcement agency). Today Foelsche would be called a gun-nut for his obsession with firearms, and a ghoul for his twin fetish for Aboriginal ethnology and penchant for collecting Indigenous human remains. The outback justice historian Tony Roberts wrote of Foelsche, who was in charge of the NT force from 1870 until 1904: “... the man who masterminded more massacres in the territory than anyone else was Inspector Foelsche. A former soldier he was cunning, devious and merciless with Aboriginals … Some considered him an expert on Aboriginals, not knowing that the skulls he studied were not merely collected by him.” Foelsche is celebrated in territory history as a rough, resilient pioneer. So much so that a street was named after him in Darwin. His contemporary William Willshire, a constable posted to Alice Springs in 1882, oversaw 20 years of disproportionate outback reprisal against the local Aboriginal people. He detailed some exploits in several books, not least The Land of the Dawning, which point to the psychopathy that led him to be charged with murder and, perhaps inevitably, pardoned. The settlers all but mutinied in his defence and he was not dismissed from the force. He resigned in 1908 – the first but not last territory police officer to be charged with murdering an Aboriginal person. It seems imponderable that he could write The Land of the Dawning in 1896, while still a serving police officer and while continuing to mete out extreme violence. He writes of encountering a big group of Aboriginal people at Victoria River: “... camped amongst rocks of enormous magnitude and long dry grass ... They scattered in all directions, setting fire to the grass on each side of us, throwing occasional spears, and yelling at us. It’s no use mincing matters – the Martini Henry carbines at this critical moment were talking English in the silent majesty of those great eternal rocks.” Of Indigenous women, Willshire mused: “Men would not remain so many years in a country like this if there were no women, and perhaps the Almighty meant them for use as He has placed them wherever the pioneers go … what I am speaking about is only natural, especially for men who are isolated away in the bush at out-stations where women of all ages and sizes are running at large.” Willshire has a street named in his honour in Alice Springs. Then, of course, there was George Murray – the former Anzac who became an NT constable and orchestrator of the 1928 Coniston massacre where, according to the accounts of some Indigenous witnesses, up to 170 people were killed. Murray, also revered at the time and for decades after as a heroic frontiersman, was cleared in a government inquiry. Bill McKinnon was the NT cop who murdered the Anangu man Yokununna at Uluru in 1934 and in so doing drove his people away from their home around what was for many years renamed Ayers Rock. McKinnon also lied to an official inquiry to cover his tracks, though his evil was exposed decades later, after his death, by the archive he left. This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the territory police’s history of violence against Indigenous people. In the context of that bloody history, the tortured sensibilities and emotions of so many during and after this year’s trial of police officer Zachary Rolfe are easy to understand. A jury acquitted Rolfe of murder last Friday over the 2019 shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu. The court heard that Walker was shot three times, with Rolfe arguing he had acted to protect his and his partner’s safety. There is no suggestion that the events outlined in the Rolfe trial mirror the course of massacres and murders in the 19th and early 20th century referred to above. But there is no doubt that the anguish of the Warlpiri people of Yuendumu at the verdict has its roots in that traumatic history. Not least because the 1928 massacre of Warlpiri at nearby Coniston in 1928 is still very much alive in familial memory around Yuendemu, where distrust and suspicion of police has a very long tail. Now, with the findings of the massacre map project, there is a national paradigm through which to view such simmering suspicion and distrust. First Nations people have for 200 years seen police across this continent shoot Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people – and face few, if any, consequences. After the Rolfe verdict Scott Morrison said he respected the decision of the “justice system”. But frontier history tells a different story when it comes to the police killing of Aboriginal people – and justice for those victims and their families.

3/19/2022,"It’s not often the prime minister gets taken to the NSW supreme court, especially by a member of his own party. But such is the vehemence of some NSW Liberal party members’ views towards the party’s internal preselection processes, that it has come to this. The challenge is the second legal action launched in recent weeks against the Liberal hierarchy by little-known 43-year-old businessman Matthew Camenzuli. Having already won a previous supreme court challenge last month – allowing the NSW executive to remain in place amid factional infighting – Camenzuli has now set his sights on an even bigger target. If he wins, the political future of two federal ministers plus a long-term federal MP will be in doubt. As it stands, the federal budget is less than a fortnight away, with the federal election campaign likely to start a few days later. Yet the Liberal party in NSW is without candidates in at least four winnable seats. This challenge could see another three thrown into disarray. Camenzuli’s suit names a suite of senior Liberals, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison; the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet; and the former federal president of the party, Chris McDiven, over actions taken in March. As a three-person committee appointed by the federal party, they briefly took control of the NSW branch and administratively affirmed three preselections: federal environment minister Sussan Ley in Farrer; immigration minister Alex Hawke in Mitchell; and Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. All three had been facing challenges for preselection, with Ley under threat from conservative rightwinger Christian Ellis. All three are now also named in Camenzuli’s court action, as well as the presidents of the state and federal Liberal divisions. With the ministers’ futures supposedly secured, the remaining preselections had been set to proceed via plebiscites in late March. But just as it seemed like the long-running factional war within the NSW Liberals had reached a ceasefire, Camenzuli this week launched another legal foray. He argues that Ley, Hawke and Zimmerman were not preselected according to the Liberal party’s constitution, and the federal executive acted beyond its powers by appointing the three-person committee of Morrison, Perrottet and McDiven. Camenzuli, a member of the NSW state executive, is either standing on principle or he smells a double-cross coming on the remaining preselections. A businessman from Parramatta, Camenzuli is the son of migrants. He founded an IT company in a garage in Greystanes that has grown into a multimillion dollar enterprise that provides software systems for residential property developers to help manage jobs. Critics within the party point out that Camenzuli’s case could indirectly benefit his cousin Charles Camenzuli’s political ambitions. Charles Camenzuli is the likely frontrunner for the seat of Parramatta if the promised plebiscite occurs, but no outcome is certain. Others say the action is proof of Matthew Camenzuli’s own desire to be in the limelight However, Matthew Camenzuli vehemently denies both suggestions. While he himself is not permitted by Liberal party rules to talk publicly, confidantes say his motivation is simple: he’s truly committed to seeing grassroots democracy take hold in the NSW Liberal party. The 43-year-old is one of a relatively small group on the state executive that has been insisting that new democratic processes introduced to the constitution of the NSW Liberal party in 2018 – and being used for the first time in 2022 – be followed. The group has resisted several proposals devised by factional leaders to carve up seats administratively and has used a rule that requires a 90% vote to use special powers to effectively stymie these deals. “The prime minister just doesn’t understand that what’s at stake here is the very heart and soul of the Liberal party, and giving members a say,” said one friend. Friends of Camenzuli say he was motivated to join the party 15 years ago because he believed the Liberals best represented small business, freedom and democracy. He and Charles Camenzuli became active in the Parramatta branch and the conservative right faction. While Charles decided to run as a candidate – he represented the Liberals in Parramatta in 2019 and is one of several people seeking preselection this time around – Matthew has involved himself in behind-the-scenes politics. He became a member of the party’s NSW state council, which represents the branches, and was elected as one of the “urban representatives” on the state executive, which effectively functions like the division’s board. In 2017 Camenzuli and other like-minded conservatives, including former prime minister Tony Abbott, were behind the so called Warringah motion that called for rule changes to give ordinary members a bigger voice in choosing candidates. The right was particularly supportive of the rule changes because they believe that the moderates have too much control over the NSW machine, while they, in fact, have a bigger base among the grassroots. But other factions opposed it, warning plebiscites could lead to outbreaks of branch stacking and destabilise the party. The 2017 Warringah proposal was modified before being adopted in 2018 so that branches got a 75% say and state executive was allocated 25% of the votes. State executive could still take over preselections but the party put in safeguards that required 90% support from state executive before special powers could be used. The 2022 federal election preselections are the first major use of the Warringah rules and the result has not been pretty. What started as an embarrassing impasse has now become a crisis. Although aligned with the right faction, Camenzuli has made it clear he has no time for the factional power brokers within the party and wants to see their power curtailed. “He puts his money where his mouth is,” said one confidante. “He doesn’t care about spending a million on legal fees, if that’s what it takes.” Camenzuli’s case is currently not due to be dealt with until April, which would make it impossible to resolve before the May election. A request for an urgent hearing is being considered. It’s possible that the remaining plebiscites will proceed and the court action will be discontinued. Or it’s possible that this will trigger a wholesale takeover by the federal division when they meet next Friday. Predicting what will happen in the NSW Liberal party has become nigh on impossible, even for those inside the tent.",News/Australia news,Who is Matthew Camenzuli?

3/19/2022,"Des Grace and his 15-year-old daughter, Rahleigha, thought they were hearing the death cries of two of their dogs, Big Boy and Rex. They had been sitting on the kitchen bench of their house in Lismore when the water came up so fast that they decided to get out at 3.30am. One of their dogs, Ripper, followed them, but Big Boy and Rex were too scared to go through the water to the front door. Des and Rahleigha would spend the next eight hours in kayaks tied to the house before climbing up a tree on to the roof. They could hear the two dogs banging their heads against the ceiling before father and daughter were rescued by a police boat. “It was very upsetting,” Des says. “Dad tried to rip the roof sheet off to get them through, but he’s actually just had surgery – like a mastectomy – so he has no muscle in one side,” says his other daughter, Annanekah. The water had come right up to the roof of the house and they thought the dogs had perished. “But they got up into the loft in the roof cavity – obviously there was enough room for them,” Annanekah says. “They were there for two days before we could get someone to rescue them.” Rex and Big Boy, now in foster care until their homeless family can take them back, are among countless animals displaced by the flood. Staffie Big Boy – who had never had separation issues before – now won’t let his foster carer out of his sight. Derek Knox, from the Animal Rescue Cooperative (ARC), says difficult decisions were made during the floods. “When the floods hit, people had to make insane choices of what to save and even which animals they could save,” Knox says. “It is an area with a lot of animals, and people were rescued from roof cavities with animals crying from the roof.” From the beginning, Kate Morris, from the charity Willow Tree Sanctuary, was on the ground. “The moment the roads opened, we were handing out donations to people on the ground and to the choppers and helping with our own search and rescue efforts,” she says. “We heard many harrowing stories of animals in trouble and sent out our volunteers and staff wherever we could,” Morris says. “We helped dogs trapped in houses, rescued cats living in tents with their owners, and helped farm animals that had been swept up in the flood waters. “We had a call from a woman who had seen a horse in Bungawalbin standing in rising flood waters with just its nose above water. We took a call to help two great danes stranded on a roof that couldn’t fit in the rescue boat. We saved 10 cats from a flooded house in Coraki. We took a call from a flooded vet clinic about a cow stuck in River Street, Ballina.” Morris says there is “a sea of displaced animals that have been showing up in the flood-affected areas”. “In the early days of the floods, local vets started reaching out to us as the lost and displaced animals started flowing into their clinics as strays.” Knox says vets have dealt with “pet animals ranging from large pythons to goats, chickens to cats and dogs”. People already traumatised by losing everything are being further traumatised by having to give up pets to go into temporary housing which cannot take animals. The lack of pet-friendly accommodation “really compounds the stress and trauma”, says Sali Bracewell of ARC. Knox says: “There is nowhere safe for animals to stay … They have no place to go.” People are choosing to live in their cars rather than give up the only thing they have left: the animals they love. One couple in touch with Knox are living with four dogs and three kids in a cabin without power or water. For five nights, Chris Trew and his wife slept in cars with two children, three dogs, two cats and a snake. “My wife has got a car and [my] son has bought a car. We sort of shared the dogs. My son would have the two dogs one night and the next night I’d have the two dogs. They are up all night, barking and carrying on.” The snake had lost its enclosure, Trew says. “We had to handle him quite a bit because you have got to try and keep it warm, so you just keep it on your body, he wraps around your neck.” The snake is now at a vet until they can get another enclosure. Others are going back into uninhabitable houses rather than surrendering a pet. Morris talks of the help provided by Willow Tree Sanctuary to a man named Doug. “One of Doug’s beloved dogs died in the floods and his other 14-year-old dog was taken to the local pound, terrified and deeply traumatised,” Morris says. “The pound thought the dog was deaf and blind because it had shut down so much. Doug left the evacuation centre so he could bring his dog home, despite their house still being filthy.” Other animals have not been so lucky. “We have seen a massive spike in the number of animals that have been surrendered over the past two weeks as the enormity of rebuilding lives with pets in tow becomes too overwhelming for some people,” Morris says. “Many more animals, both lost and surrendered pets, are ending up in local pounds and pushing them to capacity. “It is incredibly distressing, and we are doing our very best to get as many out as possible, but this is sadly an ongoing problem writ large by these disastrous floods.” At the frontline and in addition to supplying food, medical and support, Willow Tree Sanctuary and ARC are finding foster carers to look after displaced animals until they can be with their people again. Knox says they are starting to get “a flood of people offering to help and a flood of people saying, ‘I need your help’”. “Over 150 people have offered space in their homes so far and that number increases every day.” Sarah McKenzie, from Northern Rivers Animal Services, has taken nine dogs and four cats from Cabbage Tree Island, an Aboriginal mission that was completely flooded. They have all lost their homes. She says she is aiming to get the animals into “emergency foster care homes that can take care of them, where it’s a bit nicer for them than being at the shelter”. “Given that it’s going to be a protracted thing, we just don’t know how long it’s going to be. They absolutely love their pets on Cabbage Tree Island. They’re really upset to have to leave them here. “There are a lot of generous people in the community that have offered to open up their homes and care for these pets until the owners are able to take them back. So yeah, it’s awful for everyone.”",News/Australia news,"Snakes in cars, dogs on roofs: the battle to save animals stranded in the NSW floods",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/snakes-in-cars-dogs-on-roofs-the-battle-to-save-animals-stranded-in-the-nsw-floods
3/19/2022,"Practically every Australian has a favourite line from The Castle. For some it is the serenity of Bonnie Doon, the daggy dad kitchen conversation (“what do you call that, darl?”) or the jousting sticks for sale on Trading Post (“tell him he’s dreamin’!”). For others, it is the classic exclamation: “This is going straight to the pool room!” That Castle-speak remains pervasive today is just one indicator of the 1997 film’s enduring cultural resonance. The relatively low-budget local production has become one of the most beloved Australian movies of all time. Next month, the film will celebrate its 25th anniversary. “When we first did a sit-down read, it was just a funny, lovely, humble, charming little film,” Tiriel Mora, who played suburban solicitor Dennis Denuto, tells Guardian Australia. “But very much a little film. We shot it in 10-and-a-half days, and that included a half day in Canberra for the high court stuff. We couldn’t possibly know that it would resonate like it did.” But resonate it has, at the time and ever since. “It just grew and grew and grew,” he adds. The Castle tells the story of the Kerrigan family’s battle to save their suburban Melbourne home, their castle, from compulsory acquisition as the airport bordering the property seeks to expand. Father Darryl Kerrigan persuades local solicitor Denuto (more familiar with defending petty criminals – including Kerrigan’s son – than the constitution) to challenge the acquisition. After Denuto loses the case, retired barrister Lawrence Hammill QC (played by Bud Tingwell) offers to appeal pro bono to the high court. Against all odds, they win. For some, the most well-known and consequential of the numerous catchphrases of the film comes from the courtroom scene where Denuto flails haplessly for a legal authority to support his client’s case. “It’s the constitution, it’s Mabo, it’s justice, it’s law, it’s the vibe,” says Denuto. “It is rare that popular culture and the high court intersect,” says George Williams, a law professor at the University of New South Wales. “Never have they done so more spectacularly than with The Castle. The movie places the high court at the centre of a David and Goliath battle that taps into deeply held Australian values around fairness and home.” Williams says that under the real law of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution (which prohibits the federal government compulsorily acquiring land other than “on just terms”), the Kerrigans would have lost. The opposite outcome however, he says, made for a better storyline. One reason for the film’s cult status is that its producers, Working Dog, have left The Castle to a life of its own. They have largely refused to speak publicly about the film; executive producer Michael Hirsh declined an interview request from Guardian Australia. In an interview last year with Radio New Zealand while promoting the TV series Utopia, Hirsh’s Working Dog colleague Rob Sitch said, “I think in some ways the smartest thing we did was stay out of the way. It’s been a gift that keeps on giving for us.” The movie is often repeated on Channel Nine and is available to stream on Stan. “What is so refreshing about The Castle is its profound Australianness,” says William MacNeil, an honorary professor at the University of Queensland and leading expert on law and culture. MacNeil says the film corrected the cultural cringe that had previously seen Australian audiences more familiar with US or British legal dramas. “Indeed, Denuto makes so much of its ‘vibe’ that the Australian constitution – hitherto unknown in terms of its dramatic possibilities – practically becomes a leading character in the film.” In turn, the amorphous “vibe” has permeated the typically rarefied language of the legal world. The concept has found its way into many legal arguments, including in numerous hearings before the high court. Denuto’s famous submission was quoted in a NSW court judgment in 2010, while a Queensland lawyer sued for $250,000 in defamation damages after being described as “Dennis Denuto from Ipswich” (he lost). Such is the movie’s resonance within the law that it was the only film to gain an entry in the Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia. In a rare break from his silence around the film, the entry was written by Sitch, who directed and co-wrote The Castle. “It is a sweeping saga that takes the harsh Australian outback, the rugged characters of the Anzac legend, the spirit of Banjo Paterson and ignores them in favour of a greyhound-racing tow truck driver who never meant to be a hero,” he jests. In the written entry, Sitch also takes aim at the high court authorities, who refused to permit filming inside the brutalist court building in Canberra. Instead, the courtroom scenes were filmed in Melbourne, before a quick trip to Canberra to film outside the high court. Mora recalls the filming was done on a freezing Canberra Saturday, with local journalists press-ganged into being extras. “That added authenticity,” he chuckles. But The Castle, released five years after the high court’s landmark decision in Mabo, also contained a more serious message. “The film was not just brilliant entertainment,” says Emeritus Professor Tony Blackshield from Macquarie Law School. “Its real social function was to communicate a deeper social understanding of the importance of Mabo.” Blackshield suggests that the scene where Darryl Kerrigan exclaims that his predicament has helped him understand how Indigenous Australians feel about dispossession “is the central point of the film”. (In another scene, Denuto somewhat mischaracterises Mabo in a legal argument: “That’s your classic case of big business trying to take land … and they couldn’t.”) The movie was released at a time of increasingly fractious national discourse, after Mabo and the Native Title Act had recognised that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities had legal rights to land. “The film becomes this wonderful intervention, that flips this idea of home and country and land into a language that becomes identifiable [to mainstream Australian audiences],” says Professor Kieran Tranter, chair of law, technology and future at Queensland University of Technology. At a time when rightwing politicians and newspapers were arguing against native title, The Castle “sold a story to a nervous nation that was quite reassuring”, says Tranter. Mora suggests The Castle’s political message was “pointed and yet subtle” (although he acknowledges, laughing, “that doesn’t make sense”). “The very powerful underlying theme of the film is about justice, and that’s justice for all, not just for some people,” continues the actor. By using an ordinary suburban family as the vehicle, Mora suggests, it made “bigger questions of injustice to first Australians more approachable”. These remain live political issues (including before the high court). “[The Castle] touched on a very significant conversation that we are still having,” Mora adds. Whether it would be considered appropriate today to make a film indirectly addressing Indigenous issues with a largely white cast is questionable. “There are a lot of problems talking about [Indigenous] stories without having [Indigenous] representation,” admits Tranter. Asmi Wood, a Torres Strait Islander and professor at the Australian National University College of Law, says The Castle has withstood the test of time. An expert on Indigenous legal issues, Wood often discusses the film with first-year law students and is full of praise for its subtle political message. “To make people understand that there is another group of people who might feel alienated, for different reasons and different circumstances, but to create that level of empathy, I think the film is absolutely brilliant,” he says. But for all The Castle’s cultural commentary, legal legacy and political purpose, it remains popular because it guarantees a laugh. “I think it was very funny,” says Wood.",Arts/Film,"‘It’s the vibe’: 25 years on, how The Castle became an Australian classic",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/19/its-the-vibe-25-years-on-how-the-castle-became-an-australian-classic
3/19/2022,"Julie-Marie Hay didn’t always struggle on her nurse’s salary – even as a single parent and the primary carer of her three children. “I used to be able to afford what we needed when we needed it, and only struggled on the odd occasion when something big came in. Even a couple of years ago,” Hay says. Hay, 41, is an enrolled nurse and works full-time in Perth. Her fortnightly take-home pay comes in at just under $2,000. She receives small stipends from the family tax benefit and carer’s allowance from Centrelink, and occasional child support payments. And it’s not enough to keep the family’s heads above water. “I’d say I’m shorter each fortnight by about $300 in the last year alone,” Hay says. “I don’t have any debt at all. I don’t have any loans. Even that’s not enough for me to survive. If I had a loan, I would drown.” Hay is far from alone in her fears. With a federal election imminent, the rapidly rising cost of living is shaping up to be a hot-button issue. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Monday that the government was “very aware” of the strain on household budgets. “These cost of living impacts are real, and the Australian government understands that,” Morrison said. The federal government’s current solution to the issue of astronomical rises in the cost of living is to propose tax cuts. But the opposition says it is a matter of raw income. “Families are under massive pressure – everything is going up except people’s wages,” the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said this week. In a speech to the Australia Institute on Tuesday, Australian Council of Trade Unions president Michele O’Neil said that in 2021, workers earning the average income of $68,000 effectively had a pay cut of $832, as price increases outstripped the minor raises negotiated in enterprise bargaining. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, consumer prices rose 3.5% and wages just 2.3% last year. Hay says she does her best to provide everything her family needs, juggling costs fortnight by fortnight, but it’s what she has to go without that is the most telling. Hay’s children, aged seven, 11 and 16, all have attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). One of them is also autistic. They require regular visits to a paediatrician (around $600 every six months), medication (approximately $220 a month) and GP visits in between for supplementary scripts. They are inflexible about what they will and won’t eat, so budgeting opportunities in the weekly grocery shop are limited. So Hay restricts her own food “so I don’t have the excess costs”. She taught herself to service her own car so she could save on routine maintenance. She had to access her superannuation so she could pay for dental work. She borrowed money from a colleague to pay for Christmas presents. And although she was diagnosed with ADHD too, she hasn’t yet been able to seek treatment for herself. “I couldn’t follow up on it because I couldn’t afford it,” she says. Hay’s small Mazda3, which she needs to drive to work each day, used to cost around $60 to fill. Now it costs more like $80 or $90. And then there’s rent, which has “skyrocketed” in Perth. Hay’s rose $60 per week last April and she is terrified it will rise again next month. “I don’t have any savings, so if they say to me ‘you’re out’, then I’m stuck.” Hay is concerned that even the relatively ambitious pay rises on her industry’s agenda are unlikely to make a dent on her day-to-day life. “We’re asking for 4% in this next raise, and even that scares me because I don’t think that’s going to cover what I require to be able to survive. And if they push my rent up, then it’s not going to cover anything.” “The wage system in this country is broken,” says Tim Kennedy, national secretary for the United Workers Union. “This is not by accident; it is by design.” The economic crisis caused by the pandemic exacerbated already existing inequalities in Australia, Kennedy says. “Unless Australian workers are given the capacity to obtain a fair share in wages, then more people will fall back into unnecessary poverty.” It’s not just wages that aren’t keeping up with the cost of living. If even those on a full-time income are struggling, things are even tougher for people who need to rely on government support payments. Desanka Ogrizovic, 36, supports her 12-year-old daughter and herself on jobseeker payments. Having worked as both a counsellor and in the beauty industry, she has been looking for jobs and trying to build her own business, but has struggled to land work. Ogrizovic is luckier than some: she and her daughter have been able to live rent-free in her grandmother’s apartment since her grandmother moved into aged care. It cuts out one of the biggest cost burdens – at least for now. But it’s not a permanent solution, especially as she knows that there is literally no housing in the cities that is affordable for people on jobseeker payments. “It’s not an easy situation,” Ogrizovic says. “I know married couples that live together also struggle but I feel like it’s harder when you’re just one parent. “Sometimes I’m left with $5 by the end of the fortnight. My daughter knows how hard we budget. I don’t try to bombard her with that stuff but you can see that she can see how little I have.” Jobseeker payments are scheduled to rise on 20 March – by $13.20, taking the base rate to $629.50 per fortnight. The change, a routine indexing increase, was described in a media release from Senator Anne Ruston, the minister for families and social services, as “a boost” that would “help [people] keep up with the changes in the cost of living”. The sting feels particularly sharp, coming two years after the federal government doubled those same payments as the Covid-19 pandemic hit, and then halved them again a year ago. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) has condemned the decision to cut back the rate to pre-pandemic levels as “shameful”. “It is a scandal and international disgrace that despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the world, Australia is back to having one of the lowest rates of unemployment payment in the OECD,” Goldie says. “We know from personal testimonies and surveys that the majority of people on these very low income support payments will struggle even more to feed their families and keep a roof over their head. “They sink into debt because they can’t pay their energy bills, keep a car on the road or meet unexpected costs for appliances or computers. We are facing a homelessness and housing affordability crisis as more people struggle to pay increasing rents.” Hay says she feels like the struggles of ordinary people aren’t being heard by those in power. “I think the government needs to listen to the people who are actually working on the ground, doing all the essential things that are keeping [the country] going. “I’m on the frontline trying to help keep our city and our country and people safe and alive. And we’re getting no recognition for that. None at all. It’s almost like they’re saying, we’re going to penalise you for doing that, that’s how it feels.”",News/Australia news,How Australia’s skyrocketing cost of living is pushing people into poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/how-australias-skyrocketing-cost-of-living-is-pushing-people-into-poverty
3/19/2022,"In early 1924, when work began on arguably this country’s most defining built structure, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Australia was torn between self-identifying as a loyal outpost of empire and one of the globe’s most innovative new democracies. The bridge, for all its ambition, was always going to signify – in the political, cultural and (white) Australian social sensibility of the day – more than a mere “proud arch” linking the topographically close but practically remote north shore at Milsons Point to Dawes Point in the south. In just 23 years of federation, Australia had become a template for global social progress, with women’s suffrage, workers’ protections, social security and high living standards – albeit at the expense of the dispossessed, near-eradicated First Nations peoples. When it opened nine decades ago on Saturday, the bridge – with its distinctive bow constructed of 40,000 tonnes of steel and six million rivets – stood as a breathtaking sculptural testimony to Australian (and harbour city) exceptionalism. “The bridge was an early and very powerful symbol of the modern Australian project,” says the Sydney-based urban historian Paul Ashton. “It ties in with the idea of ‘Australia unlimited’ – where there were no limits to what a young nation could aim to do if its natural and human resources were harnessed to the full capacity using the latest engineering technology.” Great Britain, apparently, viewed it differently. The “coat hanger” was built under the direction of the visionary Australian public works engineer John Bradfield (responsible for much of Sydney’s urban transport infrastructure), but was designed by the British firm Dorman Long of Middlesborough, and based on that company’s own Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne. Most of the steel for the bridge was smelted in England and then shipped in pre-formed sections to Australia, though some of the steel was sourced from Newcastle. When somewhere between 300,000 and a million people turned out for the opening, they did so under two giant flags – the Union Jack and the Australian ensign – snapping symbiotically atop construction cranes. The neophyte nation was finding its stride alright, but for Great Britain the bridge signified this was all still very much part of the colonial project. “In the orgy of self-congratulation that accompanied the opening ... much was made of this bond [between Australia and empire], with most of the British press hailing the bridge as a triumph of British engineering’,” writes Peter Spearritt in his “biography” of the bridge, The Sydney Harbour Bridge – A Life, released for its 50th anniversary. “That Australians had thought up the idea, raised the loan funds, [£6.25m, finally fully repaid through tolls in 1988] manufactured much of the materials and physically erected the structure was all too readily forgotten, though at that time many Australians still thought of themselves as British, even if they had been born here.” Ashton points out the bridge also embodied a profound symbolism in still extant parochial tensions between Sydney and Melbourne, which, due to the political chicanery surrounding colonial federation negotiations, served as the interim national capital until 1927 when federal parliament opened in Canberra. “Even then I think there was this sense in Sydney of, ‘Well, yes, you’ve got the Yarra and the federal parliament – but just look what we are going to have’,” Ashton says. These intercity tensions highlight another truth about the new nation from early federation. Despite many of its early 20th-century writers and journalists – not least the “bush bards” Henry Lawson and AB “Banjo” Paterson – depicting a mythical Australia of rugged, egalitarian frontiersman, by the time the bridge was under construction Australia was already one of the most urbanised countries in the world. Sydney was its exemplar. As the great steel arches inched towards closure, 134m over the harbour, the new bridge was celebrated as a monolithic testimony to that white urban modernity and growth. Instructively, after the 1930 census when the city’s population reached 1.23 million, Sydney regarded itself as the “second white city of empire” after surpassing Glasgow. As the unjoined spans stretched across the harbour, the emerging bridge was an everyday fascination for Sydney residents. The newspapers were captivated by its engineering intrigues, publishing daily articles during construction. Spearritt writes how “the construction of the arches was so much more spectacular than anything that had gone before that press, amateur and professional photographers competed in an unceasing photographic orgy of attempting to shoot the bridge from a new angle or in a new light”. The bridge, it was reported, “rises and falls and expands and contracts with the effects of the temperature, without, of course, impairing the stability or safety ... With an increase of degrees ... the crown, or centre, of the arch will rise or lift about seven inches, with a proportionate and, of course, lessening rise at the other portions of the arch towards either end of the bridge.” Its capacity for climatically-responsive contraction and expansion was tested on the very day – 19 August 1930 – the arches met. As the evening cooled there was a slight contraction and reopening. The gap was finally, permanently, closed at 10pm. There was every sense that this landmark would stand for an effective eternity – like the Pyramids or the Colosseum or the oldest English bridges. “Those designing and building the bridge have had to have regard for the most minute details, and for the fact that they are responsible for a structure, not of a day, but for all time.” It is a global landmark – an architectural/engineering wonder that crowns the harbour. Every New Year’s Eve it lights up with a firework display that is televised globally – a first talisman of the new year for many in the northern hemisphere. Novelists, poets, journalists, photographers and visual artists – notably Grace Cossington Smith – were similarly inspired and captivated by what they embraced as an iconic testimony to 20th century Australian progress (the use of “iconic” is cautioned against in the Guardian style guide, except in the most exceptional circumstances – of which this is surely one). Perhaps the most extraordinary literary testimony to the bridge was the self-published, decidedly esoteric 534-page Parables of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, written in 1930 by the Rev Frank Cash, rector of Christ church in Lavender Bay. He was fascinated with every element of the demolition works and subsequent construction taking place outside his windows. However, he seemed barely cognisant of the human cost (16 lives were lost in construction) and the countless businesses closed and many poor rendered homeless for the leviathan. This attitude, Ashton says, was pervasive, as “the bridge profoundly demonstrated how naturalised the ideology of progress had become in Australian society”. He says: “A delegation of workers made a case [to government] for the working-class families whose homes were going to be demolished to make way for the ‘coat hanger’ ... their petition said that they knew that they could not stand ‘in the way of progress’ and simply wanted to be re-housed.” But, Spearritt points out, there was no state housing authority to help and politics impeded any effective rehousing assistance – Jack Lang’s Labor government lost power in 1927, and after reelection in 1930 the New South Wales governor sacked his administration soon after the bridge opened in 1932. As Delia Falconer writes in her seminal book, Sydney, great swathes of Millers Point and The Rocks were levelled. “So intent was the city on achieving this feat of engineering that it used a strong arm to evict struggling residents from their many terraces and shops; few received compensation or support, and some heartbreaking letters remain in the archives from people pleading for a few pounds’ assistance.” It should also be acknowledged that the bridge and the harbour city it and its twin, the Opera House, architecturally define are imposed on the lands and waters of the Eora custodians, who, by the time the demolitions began, had been thoroughly dispossessed and decimated by violence and disease. When the First Fleet anchored in the harbour in 1788, the shore was dotted with towers of shell, some 12m high – monumental middens proudly bolstered over countless generations, testimony to 60-plus millennia of Indigenous continental civilisation. The colonists quickly burnt them all for building lime. So, not everyone will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the bridge’s eventful opening – when the antique dealer, former soldier, staunch royalist and member of the proto-fascist New Guard Francis De Groot inveigled his way into the vice regal party on horseback and cut the ribbon with his sabre, ahead of Lang, thereby guaranteeing himself an eccentric posterity. Suburban streets emptied as Sydneysiders poured into the city to traverse the bridge, which would not be open solely to pedestrians again until the 50th anniversary in 1982. In 2000, the bridge was once again closed to traffic as 250,000 people took part in the people’s walk for Aboriginal reconciliation. It was an optimistic moment on a stunning clear morning, in the most photogenic city of a modern nation at the beginning of a new millennium. Twenty-two years later, reconciliation’s progress is slow; the Aboriginal flag has been permanently flown from the bridge’s apex since last month. “Eternity”, the fireworks on the bridge spelled out at midnight on 1 January 2000 – a tribute to another Sydney eccentric, Arthur Stace, taken to chalking the evocative forevermore word on footpaths across the burgeoning city. An eternity for a modern marvel forever reaching across the harbour, perhaps – but always steeped in the bedrock of a land with a timeless human past.",News/Australia news,A bridge to empire – and beyond: Sydney’s ‘coat hanger’ turns 90,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/a-bridge-to-empire-and-beyond-sydneys-coat-hanger-turns-90
3/19/2022,"It was a classic Peter Dutton outing. The defence minister used a speech this week to warn that “ominous clouds are forming” in the Indo-Pacific, that China and Russia’s “unholy alliance” should ring alarm bells, and that countries in the region must confront the “mounting threats to regional stability”. Dutton then turned his attention to threats closer to home: specifically Labor, his electoral enemy, based on a simplistic extrapolation of its previous record in defence. “When we came in to government [defence] spending was at 1.56% of GDP – the lowest level since 1938,” he told a United States Studies Centre event in Canberra. “Had spending continued on that trajectory we would have had $55bn less in aggregate spent in defence and on acquisition over the course of the last several years, and we would be facing a budget today with a three in front of it instead of a four. This year we spent $41bn.” It’s a taste of what voters are likely to hear during the election campaign as the Coalition seeks to make national security a central issue, with Scott Morrison repeatedly declaring that we are living in uncertain times and now is not the time to change captains. But experts say there is largely bipartisanship on major defence issues, including on ramping up spending levels, recruiting more ADF personnel and implementing the much-trumpeted Aukus pact with the US and the UK – even as the nuclear-powered submarines plan is yet to be bedded down. In one sense, the Coalition’s attempt to cast backwards is a marker of how the parties are largely united on the major strategic settings that they believe are suited to the current security environment. But Dutton’s defence spending tale describes a parallel universe that doesn’t exist. He’s taken a single-year percentage and added up the total gap in spending in the unlikely scenario that the rate had remained at that historical low for every year between then and now. Dennis Richardson, a longtime public servant who has worked under both sides of politics, started as defence secretary a few months after the Gillard government’s 2012 budget outlined plans to cut about $5.5bn from the defence portfolio, spread over four years, including by deferring some acquisitions and reducing the civilian workforce. That was a time when Labor remained under significant political pressure to deliver promised budget surpluses, and months before Xi Jinping took power in Beijing. (Two years later, Tony Abbott invited China’s president to address the Australian parliament and feted him at a state dinner.) “That sole budget is not the reason why we have a problem now, quite obviously,” Richardson says. He notes that the Gillard government published a new defence white paper in 2013 that “did commit the Labor government to increasing the defence budget to 2% of GDP”. “In other words, the Labor government learned from the criticism it legitimately got following [that] budget.” According to an analysis of official data compiled by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, annual defence spending as a share of the economy hovered between 1.7% and 1.8% of GDP during the life of the Howard government. Under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, it hit a peak of 1.96% in 2009-10 and a low of 1.59% in 2012-13. Under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments it has steadily risen to be about 2% now – and will continue to increase. Prof Peter Dean, the director of the University of Western Australia’s defence and security institute, says defence spending “is and will continue to be a big battleground” in the election even though both parties have a commitment to 2% or above. He notes how the same figures can be interpreted multiple ways. “The Coalition is right that defence spending under Labor fell to the lowest point of GDP since 1938 – if you want to compare defence spending to the monetary value of final goods and services in the economy,” Dean says. “If, however, you want to look at government spending on defence as a percentage of the [overall] budget, Labor spent more in their last two years in office than the Coalition has in 2021-2022. Nine years on from 2013, though, both the budget and the economy are much larger, as is overall defence spending.” Increased defence spending is one thing. What it actually delivers is another. Dean says Aukus “will be difficult for no matter who wins government” and “will require closer cooperation with the US in a period of increased risk”. Regardless of who forms government, leaders will face post-election decisions about how the nuclear-propelled submarines are actually built and delivered, which remains subject to a study conducted jointly with the US and the UK. Dean published a paper this week describing the Aukus announcement six months ago as “the moment the Australian government came to terms with the repercussions of a more assertive China, a more multipolar global order and changing US power”. But he argues the broader security cooperation aspects of Aukus “are far more important than Australia’s shift to nuclear-powered submarines”. “The benefits of Aukus in the near term will be found in other areas such as long range missile collaboration and science and technology,” he says. While Labor has attempted to dismiss any suggestion of a divide on Aukus or on the major national security threats, it has also sought to chip away at any perceived Coalition political advantage on the issue. Labor says it is entitled to question the Coalition’s record on major acquisitions, including the new frigates and the handling of the now-dumped French submarine contract. “We are facing times of global instability, particularly growing tensions within our region,” Brendan O’Connor, the shadow defence minister, told the same US Studies Centre event that Dutton addressed this week. “And though we share concerns on these matters, we have an obligation to question the gap between what the government says and what the government delivers.” Chief among Labor’s concerns is the so-called “capability gap” between now and when the first of the new nuclear-propelled submarines are ready in the late 2030s. The government has committed to major work to extend the life of the existing conventionally powered Collins class submarines. Labor says, if elected, it would take advice on what can be done to bridge the gap, including considering fitting tomahawk missiles to the existing submarines and assessing what strike capabilities could be accelerated or strengthened in the near term. It has also committed to ensuring all defence contracts “have measurable and enforceable levels of local content”. On the whole, these may seem to be minor differences and tentative commitments. But it would be wrong to say there is no difference between the major parties on approaches to national security. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has sought to elevate recognition of the climate crisis as a key national security threat. He said he would order the head of national intelligence and the secretary of defence to undertake a climate-driven security risk assessment within four months of coming to government. One option is to set up a new Office of Climate Threat Intelligence. And, in the wake of severe flooding in northern NSW and south-east Queensland, Labor would consider the need for a new national emergency taskforce. Albanese argues a stronger climate policy – including a more ambitious 2030 target – would give Australia more credibility in its relations with Pacific nations. Dean observes: “Morrison has issues inside his own party with this and chose not to make the link to national security while visiting flood areas. Albanese has no such problem with this – meaning Labor is more aligned with the US than the government on this, given the Biden administration’s work on climate and security.” When it comes to the relationship with China, however, both major parties now see the differences as largely structural, and not something that can enjoy a simple “reset” merely by a change in tone. This week Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, met with the new Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, a week after the minister, Marise Payne did so. Wong made largely the same points as Payne (on human rights, detained Australians, and free trade) and affirmed that those positions were bipartisan. Wong also “expressed her serious concerns over reports that Russia has asked China for weapons” and urged Beijing to reject the request. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After being rebuked by current and former national security officials, the Morrison government appears to have stepped back from last month’s heightened rhetoric about Albanese being the Chinese Communist party’s choice in the forthcoming election. That doesn’t mean the Coalition’s warnings against “appeasing” China won’t return as polling day approaches, but it is far from clear whether that line of attack has resonated with voters. “It’s legitimate for there to be differences on national security in a liberal democracy. There always have been,” Richardson told the National Press Club this week. “There were differences over the Vietnam war. There were differences over the Iraq War.” Richardson said he had spoken up because he objected to the government’s attempt “to create the perception of a difference on China where, in fact, there was none” – something he saw as contrary to Australia’s national interests. “Beyond that, however, I hope there is debate, an active debate on matters of national security,” Richardson said. “That’s as it should be in a liberal democracy. That doesn’t weaken us. I suspect [Vladimir] Putin would be in a better position today if there was a bit more debate and questioning within his own system.”",News/Australia news,Peter Dutton casts Coalition as stronger than Labor on defence as election nears – so how different are they?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/peter-dutton-casts-coalition-as-stronger-than-labor-on-defence-as-election-nears-so-how-different-are-they
3/19/2022,"The truck convoy that paralyzed much of downtown Ottawa for nearly a month cost the city more than C$36m, officials have said, and the figure is expected to rise in the coming weeks. A memo released by the city on Friday said policing costs accounted for the vast majority of the $36.3m bill. The so-called ‘Freedom Convoy’ arrived in the Canadian capital at the end of January, initially a protest over Covid-19 vaccine mandates, but eventually turning into a broader demonstration against the incumbent government, with calls to overthrow the prime minister. In mid-February, after the federal government invoked emergency legislation, hundreds of police dismantled the barricades and arrested nearly 200 people, including influential figures in the protest and convoy organizers. In a breakdown of the costs associated with the occupation, the city said it paid out $27.7m to police officers for wages, accommodation for police from out of town, vehicle expenses and food. Costs for bringing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to aid in dismantling the protests were not included in the $27m figure. Ottawa is expected to ask the federal government to reimburse the city for “all costs associated with the response”, city manager Steve Kanellakos told councillors Friday. The figure probably does not reflect the broader economic damage to the city. Local businesses in the downtown area were forced to shut down for weeks and city infrastructure will also need repairs. The $36m is more than double what the city earmarked for affordable and supportive housing in the most recent budget. In addition to a stiff economic cost, the convoy has already exacted widespread political damage in the city, deepening rifts and leading to raucous council meetings. Midway through the protests, police chief Peter Sloly resigned amid mounting criticism that he and his team had let the protests get out of hand. “This city is in chaos and it doesn’t need to be,” councillor Anne Meehan said before abruptly resigning from the police services board. All other board members also resigned in the days that followed, except for board chair councillor Diane Deans, who was removed by a council vote.",News/World news,Ottawa truck convoy cost the city more than C$36m – mainly in police expenses,https://www.theguardian.com/discover-cool-canada/2022/mar/18/ottawa-truck-convey-cost-c36m-police
3/19/2022,"Consumers will no longer be able to buy free-range eggs in the UK from Monday, with birds not having been allowed outdoors since November due to fears of avian flu outbreaks. Eggs sold in shops will have to carry a sticker or label saying they are in fact “barn eggs”, the name given to eggs produced by hens permanently housed indoors. The UK was hit by what government officials have said is the “largest ever outbreak of avian flu” this winter, with more than 80 reported outbreaks in England. As a result, birds reared for meat and eggs have been ordered by the UK government to be kept indoors since November to reduce the risk of outbreaks. The length of time they have been kept indoors means their eggs can now no longer be labelled free-range. The rules apply to all birds, whether produced by one hen in a garden or a large-scale poultry business. Farmers had hoped the government would lift the housing order next week, but after new avian flu outbreaks in the past week, officials have decide to keep the order in place. Suffolk-based egg producer Daniel Brown, who keeps more than 40,000 free-range hens, said his birds had coped well indoors so far. “We’ve given them extra things in the shed like hay and grit to give them things to peck at and keep them amused.” Brown said avian flu outbreaks usually drop off as the weather warms, so he hopes the latest housing order will be lifted soon. “A chicken won’t be bothered about not going outside in December and January, but when it’s nice in May they’ll want to be out late into the evening,” he said. The UK has not been alone in being affected by avian flu outbreaks this year, with continental Europe suffering one its worst winters for the disease too. France has been trialling avian influenza vaccines, but the solution has been complicated by the numerous strains of bird flu and the bans some countries have on importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The 16-week grace period we allowed for free-range eggs has now been exceeded, and eggs must now be marketed as ‘barn eggs’. We have worked closely with the sector and retailers to implement these changes as smoothly as possible.” The British Retail Consortium said that supermarkets would be providing signage to explain the change to consumers, but that “when the current measures are lifted, eggs will go back to being free-range”.The National Farmers’ Union’s chief poultry adviser, Aimee Mahony, said: “Shoppers may notice different labels on egg packs explaining that the eggs have been laid by hens temporarily housed to protect their health and welfare. Once the risk levels have reduced and the housing measures have been lifted by Defra, birds will be able to go outside again.”",News/World news,Free-range eggs unavailable in Britain from Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/free-range-eggs-unavailable-britain-avian-flu
