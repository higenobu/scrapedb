1/1/2022,"The number of confirmed Covid cases in the UK continued to rise on the last day of 2021, with 189,846 reported in the previous 24 hours, while the number of people in hospital and the number of deaths also rose. The figures follow two consecutive days when the number of new cases was above 180,000, with a record 189,213 reported on Thursday and 183,037 on Wednesday ‚Äì although the latter included a backlog in some nations of cases recorded before and during the Christmas period.  Friday‚Äôs figures reported 203 people having died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Thursday‚Äôs data had 332 recorded deaths, a steep rise from 57 on Wednesday, explained in part by NHS England not reporting hospital deaths since 24 December. The number of Covid patients in hospital in England increased to 12,395 on Friday, from 11,452 the day before. Experts say the daily case figures do not include reinfections and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, suggesting the true number of infections is likely to be higher. According to a new estimate on Friday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in 25 people in England had Covid before Christmas, including one in 15 in London. Based on swabs collected from randomly selected households in England, the ONS said an estimated 4% of the community had Covid in the week ending 23 December ‚Äì equating to about 2,024,700 people. The week before, about one in 35 people were estimated to be infected.",News/World news,"UK Covid case numbers climb to 189,846 on last day of 2021",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/uk-covid-case-numbers-climb-to-189456-on-last-day-of-2021
1/1/2022,"The financial markets climbed a wall of worry through 2021, as investors drove up asset prices in the face of persistently high inflation, a global supply chain crisis and one of the most frenzied speculative booms in decades. Shares rallied to record levels as money poured into stocks, deal-making soared and the gamification of investing hit new heights. Here are some of the biggest moments from a rollercoaster year.  The year‚Äôs drama began on Wall Street, where groups of retail traders teamed up through online forums to attempt one of the biggest short squeezes in market history. Organised through Reddit‚Äôs Wall Street Bets group, they homed in on beaten-down stocks that hedge funds had shorted (by selling borrowed stock, planning to buy it back cheaper in future). In a frenzy that gripped Wall Street, the WSB army used two weapons to cut down the hedgies: call options ‚Äì derivatives that gave the right to buy shares at a certain price ‚Äì and memes, to fuel their orchestrated buying, as they tapped into public distaste for predatory speculators. The phenomenon started with GameStop, the US video game retailer, driving its share price up an astonishing 1,700% in a month, and briefly causing the markets to wobble as hedge funds ran up huge losses trying to buy borrowed stock back. But this squeeze was dramatically, and controversially, punctured after trading app Robinhood curbed share buying. It blamed demands from its clearing houses; r/wallstreetbets cried foul, although a lawsuit claiming a conspiracy with market-maker Citadel Securities was thrown out last month. The saga resulted in a new vocabulary entering the markets, with ‚Äúdiamond handed‚Äù traders refusing to fold their positions, and others crying ‚Äúyolo‚Äù (you only live once) as they embarked on risky but potentially lucrative trades. This GameStop frenzy was repeated with the cinema group AMC, the retail chain Bed Bath & Beyond, and the car rental group Avis, flaring up several times in the year. These rallies ended in tears for some retail traders, who were left holding the bag as these meme stocks dropped back. But despite a tumble in late December, GameStop is still up 700% this year, with AMC about 1,200% higher. Special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) ‚Äì created to buy other, yet unknown, companies ‚Äì also boomed early in the year, before fizzling out as some performed badly. By December a fund that tracked Spacs was down more than 20% for the year, while the S&P 500 was up more than a quarter. This speculative fever was fuelled by a lot of money sloshing around the system, thanks to record low interest rates and pandemic stimulus programmes. ‚ÄúThe big theme remains how the price of all financial assets remains grossly inflated both on a relative and outright basis,‚Äù says Bill Blain, a strategist at Shard Capital. Central bankers continued their ultra-loose monetary policy through 2021, repeatedly soothing the markets that rising prices would be temporary. America‚Äôs Federal Reserve kept buying $120bn (¬£89bn) of bonds each month, but finally started to taper the programme in November, as inflation hit its highest level in decades. This ‚Äúmonetary distortion‚Äù has warped the way people think about capitalist free markets, Blain argues. ‚ÄúDistorted financial asset prices create all kinds of unintended consequences ‚Äì from stalling the normal ‚Äòbusiness cycle‚Äô by allowing obsolete zombie companies to survive, stifling and distorting business evolution, to facilitating the misdirection of capital within the economy.‚Äù Or, as the Wall Street Bets crowd put it, ‚Äúmoney printer go brrr‚Äù. ‚ö†Ô∏èBREAKING:*U.S. CORE PCE INFLATION JUMPS 4.7% IN NOVEMBER, LARGEST ANNUAL INCREASE SINCE 1989üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ pic.twitter.com/EL2VIOQFfq These massive distortions were most evident in the cryptocurrency market, where the combined value of bitcoin, ethereum and newer entrants such as solano reached $3tn in the summer, before prices chilled later in the year.

Covid disruption to trade networks and factory production was exacerbated after the Ever Given container ship became wedged in the Suez canal in March. While iron ore and copper experienced volatility, lumber prices really stood out. They surged in the first half of 2021, jumping 400% to a peak of $1,700 per thousand board feet in May amid short supplies. But prices then tumbled, as builders put construction projects on ice. Agricultural inflation hit people in the pocket, too. Global food prices reached 10-year highs, with corn and wheat up 20%, and arabica coffee bean prices gaining 80%. Had investors known on 1 January that US inflation would rech 6.8%, a 39-year high, by November, they would have be forgiven for investing in gold. But the traditional hedge against inflations had its worst year since 2015, losing about 4% and lagging many other assets. Inflation also affected fixed income assets, with global bond markets on course for their worst year since 1999. Overall, the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100 had a solid year, gaining about 14%. Wall Street saw strong gains ‚Äì with the Nasdaq Composite up 21% and the broad S&P 500 index surging 28% over the year, including a remarkable 70 record highs.

1/1/2022,"My friend Terence O‚ÄôMalley, who has died aged 79, was an inspirational teacher who became a passionate campaigner for the rights and welfare of the people of Afghanistan, and chairman since 2000 of Safe, the Irish aid organisation for Afghanistan. Terry was fired by a deep sense of injustice at the neglect by foreign powers of their former battleground in Afghanistan. In 2001, a month after the September 11 attacks, he wrote in the Irish Times of that neglect and of the aid efforts that had been hampered by a failure to grasp local nuances of behaviour and custom. The exceptions occurred when aid workers ‚Äúwho had spent many years working among the Afghans ‚Ä¶ knew and understood Afghan tribal customs and identified with them and were privileged to have Afghans as close friends‚Äù.  In that spirit (and for comfort) he wore local dress when visiting remote communities on horseback, immersed himself in the culture ‚Äì and made friends. He put his trust in Afghans and sought partnership with local NGOs, initially helping to educate young people for the reconstruction effort, later laying more emphasis on direct aid for rural development projects. The rights of Afghan women were a key concern. Terry aided Mary Akrami, who founded the first women‚Äôs shelters in Kabul. He was equally intent on creating the conditions for change, knowing that a Safe-funded school where girls would study alongside boys was a gateway to their liberation. Terry was born in Oldham, Greater Manchester, the son of Marion (nee Hilton) and George O‚ÄôMalley. George‚Äôs job with ICI took the family to County Dublin when Terry was five and he was schooled at Midleton College, Cork, the High School Dublin and Trinity College Dublin, where he studied science and mathematics. Already he was drawn to the east: embarking for India straight after university, he spent six happy years managing tea estates in Assam. He and Patricia Daybell were married in Dibrugarh, Assam, in 1968 ‚Äì they had known each other for years in Ireland. Back in Ireland, they worked shoulder to shoulder at Aravon preparatory school, south of Dublin, where Terry was headteacher for 20 years from 1977. The enthusiasm and sense of adventure that had taken him to India, and led him to get involved in Safe (Support for Afghan Further Education) in the 1990s, were part of what made Terry a gifted educator. Long before science became part of the Irish primary school curriculum, his pupils were engrossed in breeding locusts in the classroom ‚Äì to name one award-winning project. He drew the children into his own passion for cricket and other sports, for drama, music and much more. Behind his old-school gravitas and pursuit of high standards lay a belief in education in the fullest sense of the word, and a warm, deep and thoroughly modern rapport with his pupils, in many cases lasting long after they had left school and until his final days. He is survived by Patricia, his daughters, Kate, Clare and Lucy, son, Jamie, his sister, Barbara, and seven grandchildren.",News/World news,Terence O‚ÄôMalley obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/terence-omalley-obituary
1/1/2022,"‚ÄúThe future is far from certain,‚Äù says Julian Pariera, the owner of Beauchamp Laundry Services in Birmingham. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely concerned at how things are panning out.‚Äù Pariera is one of thousands of small business owners across the UK who will bear the brunt of the national energy crisis that risks driving the UK to a cost of living catastrophe within the next year. Before next winter, he will need to renegotiate an energy deal to run the washers and clothes dryers that his customers rely on after a record surge in energy market prices.  ‚ÄúWe fix our energy tariffs for up to five years, and every time we renew a deal it seems to double. This time I won‚Äôt be surprised if our energy costs quadruple. It‚Äôs madness,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThese costs can‚Äôt be reflected in our charges because if we put up our prices by this much our customers wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it. So the question I have to ask myself is how we can manage while still protecting our customers?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe government talks about getting business back on track after Covid ‚Äì and I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre doing a bad job ‚Äì but with these cost pressures it‚Äôs just ridiculous. We‚Äôll carry on somehow because this business has been in place for the last 30 years ‚Äì we‚Äôre established ‚Äì but if we were just starting out we wouldn‚Äôt manage,‚Äù Pariera says. For now, it is still more affordable for many of Beauchamp Laundry‚Äôs customers to bring in damp clothes and linen to be tumble dried during the winter than to run their own dryers at home, Pariera says. But at some point in the next year he may need to adjust his dryers to offer fewer minutes for each pound spent. These concerns are shared by small business owners across the country, which employ almost 13 million staff and make ¬£1.6tn in turnover every year. The Federation of Small Businesses has warned that energy costs are the top concern of its members and could prove to be ‚Äúan existential threat‚Äù, particularly for the fragile end of the small business sectors that were hardest hit by Covid-19 restrictions. Ibrahim Dogus, the owner of three restaurants near the London Eye, says a ‚Äúvicious circle‚Äù of rising costs and falling revenue endemic across the hospitality industry means even longstanding eateries in prime locations are struggling to secure affordable energy deals. Many suppliers refuse to offer contracts to restaurants without a hefty security deposit, or charge eye-watering rates to guard against the risk they might go under, he says. ‚ÄúBefore the recent price hike I‚Äôd pay between ¬£2,500 and ¬£3,000 a month for energy at one restaurant. But my latest bill for November was ¬£5,600. At the same time, turnover has fallen to between 10% and 15% of what it used to be. Before the pandemic we might serve 600 people; these days it‚Äôs closer to 60. But our costs are still climbing. We‚Äôre quite worried,‚Äù he says. Dogus has already cut his staff from 60 to 25, made use of the government‚Äôs support schemes, and negotiated payment plans to manage the debt he owes to his landlords and pay business rates. But energy companies are the exception, he says, and this could prove the difference between whether his chain survives or not. ‚ÄúEnergy companies are not interested in helping at all. If you don‚Äôt pay in full for a couple of months someone comes to turn off your lights. Never mind that you can‚Äôt pay them if you can‚Äôt serve customers. It would be over,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very difficult moment for small businesses. There‚Äôs been Brexit, there‚Äôs been Covid. But on top of everything else, energy costs could be the breaking point,‚Äù he says.",News/Business,‚ÄòEnergy costs could be the breaking point‚Äô: UK‚Äôs small businesses being pushed to brink,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/31/energy-costs-uk-small-businesses-restaurants
1/1/2022,"My wife, Ruth Freeman, who has died aged 67 of breast cancer, was a researcher, author, and teacher in dental public health. Unusually, she was also a practising psychoanalytic psychotherapist. In her public health role, much of her work focused on people being unable to access the dental care they needed. Born in Glasgow, Ruth was the daughter of Joan (nee Goldblatt), a medical social worker, and Tom Freeman, a renowned psychoanalyst. Her formative years were spent at the groundbreaking Demonstration School, Dundee, where children were taught through a series of projects. After then attending Belfast Royal Academy, she began her dental training at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, qualifying in 1974. After a master‚Äôs in dental public health at University College London, she returned to Queen‚Äôs as a lecturer and began her research in health promotion, working partly with young children frightened of the dentist. She was appointed the first female professor at Queen‚Äôs dental school in 2000.  Ruth trained in psychotherapy with her father and practised from the family home in Antrim. In 2006 she became professor of dental public health research at the University of Dundee. Here her focus was on minority groups without easy access to dental care. She developed two nationally funded Scottish government programmes to improve the oral health of homeless people and those in prison. The work is continuing. She also set up her own psychotherapy practice at her home in Newport. Ruth was a member of the British Psychoanalytic Council and a fellow of the Faculty of Public Health, Royal College of Physicians (UK). These overlapping interests motivated her focus on the needs of minority care groups. Drawn to the work of Anna Freud on children and adolescents, Ruth edited Anna Freud: Selected Writings (1998) for Penguin Classics, with Richard Ekins as her co-editor. Ruth possessed the unusual qualities of making research fun and engaging both for her colleagues and the people she sought to help. She also wrote many books, including Psychology of Dental Patient Care: the Common-sense Approach (2000); Preparing for Dental Practice (2004), with Trevor Burke; and Communication in General Practice (2006). She had recently written papers for an international research group on the social exclusion of many people through economic, political, cultural and individual factors. She was concerned that too many were not getting the oral healthcare that they needed, not only in developing but also developed societies. She had also completed a paper for the BMJ about emotional exhaustion in Scottish dental staff. She retired from her own practice in April and from the University of Dundee in August. Outside her work, she was interested in gardening, pottery and pen-and-ink illustration. Ruth and I first met at a dental conference in London and eventually married in 2014.

1/1/2022,"Since the first cases of Omicron were reported in the UK just over a month ago it has spread rapidly across the UK, fuelling a surge of infections. But scientists have also been working at speed. Here is an overview of the expanding scientific knowledge of Omicron.  Soon after the variant was first detected in southern Africa, it became apparent Omicron was highly transmissible. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Omicron is displaying a growth advantage over the Delta variant in the UK. ‚ÄúAlthough we now have high confidence in a substantial component of immune evasion, the very high growth rate and laboratory findings suggest that an increase in transmissibility may also be contributing,‚Äù the latest risk assessment for Omicron notes. The growth of Omicron has been reflected not only in record confirmed case numbers but also in random swab tests taken in the community. According to the latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics, about one in 25 people in England ‚Äì equating to 2,024,700 ‚Äì had Covid in the week ending 23 December. A number of studies have shown that Omicron has a substantial ability to evade immune responses. According the latest data released on Friday by the UKHSA, two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid jabs offer little protection against symptomatic infection, while 20 weeks after a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna jabs, protection against Omicron is only about 10%. However booster vaccinations have been found to ramp up this protection to about 65-75% two to four weeks after the jab, falling to about 40-50% protection from 10 or more weeks after the booster. Data from the insurer Discovery Health and the South African Medical Research Council has suggested protection against severe complications after two jabs was about 70% for Omicron, compared with 90-95% for Delta. But research from Imperial College London has suggested vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation 60 days after a booster is between 80% and 86% against Omicron, depending on how fast booster protection wanes. Such findings chime with the latest UKHSA data suggesting 88% vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation two weeks after a booster dose. The NHS announced on Friday that more than three-quarters of adults in England had received their booster. Some experts have suggested that high levels of protection against severe disease may, in part, be down to the action of different components of the immune system. While the mutations in Omicron mean it has a high capacity to escape neutralising antibodies, research has shown it is less able to dodge the body‚Äôs T-cells. However, Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, notes questions remain. ‚ÄúIf Omicron has thrived by evading the most potent protection through [neutralising antibodies], it‚Äôs unsurprising that the different and numerous T-cell targets are intact, but [we] still lack proof this buys you any protection,‚Äù he said. Recent research in the UK has backed up early suggestions that Omicron may cause less severe disease than Delta, even for those who are unvaccinated and have not previously been infected. According to the latest figures from the UKHSA, overall, people with Omicron are estimated to be about half as likely to go to A&E or be admitted to hospital compared with those with Delta, while the risk of hospital admission alone is approximately a third of that for Delta. The data also reveals the importance of Covid jabs, noting there is an 81% reduction in the risk of hospitalisation after three doses compared to unvaccinated Omicron cases. As experts have pointed out, even if only a small proportion of a very large number of infected people end up in hospital, that is still a large number. And both hospital admissions and the number of Covid patients in hospital are rising. Modelling released by researchers at the University of Warwick on Thursday, yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that even if Omicron has 50% severity compared with the Delta variant, there could be peaks of 1.4m daily infections, about 13,600 daily hospital admissions and 2,890 deaths a day in January. That is assuming England remains under plan B measures only, there is a rapid rollout of booster vaccinations and an efficacy against severe disease with Omicron of 85% after boosting. However, the team add that shouldthe level of booster protection be higher, the number of individuals requiring hospital admissions would be lower. There are also other uncertainties that could affect the size of the peaks, including whether Omicron has the same generation time as Delta. Prof Christina Pagel, the director of UCL‚Äôs Clinical Operational Research Unit, said that even under the team‚Äôs optimistic scenarios, hospital admissions are likely to be higher than last January under current plan B measures. ‚ÄúOne of the most worrying aspects of their modelling is that time to prevent these hospital pressures was last week or, latest, Boxing Day. If true, this means huge new pressures on the NHS within weeks,‚Äù she said.",News/World news,What do we know about the Omicron Covid variant so far?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/what-do-we-know-about-the-omicron-covid-variant-so-far
1/1/2022,"New York City‚Äôs leaders are pushing ahead with plans for the annual New Year‚Äôs Eve party in Times Square despite record numbers of new Covid infections driven by the Omicron variant. Outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is set to step down at midnight on Saturday, told NBC‚Äôs Today show that pressing ahead with the public celebration would show ‚Äúthat we‚Äôre moving forward, and we want to show the world that New York City is fighting our way through this.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important to not give up in the face of this,‚Äù he added. De Blasio has already scaled back celebrations from the ‚Äúfull-strength‚Äù celebration he originally approved. Crowds will be limited to 15,000, down from 60,000 pre-pandemic, and everyone who enters must wear a mask. But the decision to press ahead comes in contrast to public health messaging from Washington and decisions in other large, populous cities, including San Francisco and Atlanta, to cancel their events. On Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr Anthony Fauci said he approved of small, at-home New Year‚Äôs Eve gatherings among vaccinated and boosted individuals but urged Americans to cancel plans to attend larger gatherings. ‚ÄúIf your plans are to go to a 40- to 50-person New Year‚Äôs Eve party with all the bells and whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a happy new year, I would strongly recommend that this year we do not do that,‚Äù Fauci said at a Covid-19 briefing. De Blasio said Thursday: ‚ÄúOur health-care leadership believes this is the right way to do it.‚Äù He said his administration had not held discussions about canceling or reducing the ‚Äúball drop‚Äù event further. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to send a message to the world. New York City is open,‚Äù he said, adding that the festivities at Times Square would ‚Äúshow the world that New York City is fighting our way through this‚Äù. Incoming mayor Eric Adams cancelled his inauguration party, but is still scheduled to take his oath in Times Square soon after the ball drop. He expressed hope on Thursday that 2022 would be ‚Äúa new beginning of our resiliency‚Äù. New York governor Kathy Hochul released figures on Thursday showing that the city, state and country are all breaking records for newly confirmed Covid-19 infections. New York state has set a new high in the average number of daily reported cases for the last 11 days. Across the state, more than 7,700 are currently hospitalized with the virus and the number is increasing. The city reported a record number of new, confirmed cases ‚Äì more than 39,590 ‚Äì on Tuesday, according to New York state figures. ‚ÄúAs we approach the New Year it is vitally important that we don‚Äôt let our guard down in our fight against the pandemic,‚Äù Hochul said. ‚ÄúWe have the tools and we know what works ‚Äì mask up, get vaccinated, get boosted, and exercise caution in large gatherings, especially this weekend.‚Äù The decision to press on with the Times Square party has received criticism from other elected officials. Mark Levine, who takes over as Manhattan borough president tonight, called for the event to be cancelled. ‚ÄúWe are not doing enough to slow this,‚Äù he said on Twitter. ‚ÄúNow is the time to act. Time is of the essence.‚Äù That warning comes as one fifth of the city‚Äôs police force is out due to virus infections, according to NYPD commissioner Dermot Shea. Kelly Doran, an emergency physician with NYU Langone, tweeted: ‚ÄúPretty unreal to me that NYC is still holding its big New Year‚Äôs Eve bash tomorrow when Covid cases are higher than ever, hospitals are having to call in visiting help & cancel elective surgeries, and FDNY is pleading with the public not to call 911.‚Äù As many as 20% of the city‚Äôs restaurants and bars are temporarily shuttered and owners report a sharp drop in trade. On Thursday, some of the thousands of tourists visiting the city for New Year said they were not unduly inconvenienced by the sharp rise in Covid infections. ‚ÄúWe prefer to go to places where there are less people. On New Year‚Äôs eve we will stay in our hotel,‚Äù said Antonio Palmeri, visiting from Turin with friends. ‚ÄúBut it is our dream to be in New York so we are happy to be here.‚Äù Tourists visiting the bronze charging bull on lower Wall Street on Friday said while they were anxious about the number of cases, they wanted to continue enjoying their visits. ‚ÄúThe reality is that everyone is fatigued by the pandemic, and at this point everyone knows they should be doing what they can to stay safe, but at this point we‚Äôre in a fuck it phase,‚Äù said Ben Martin, visiting from Boston. ‚ÄúIf the government is telling us to be less careful by cutting quarantine times in half, and we should go back to work, we‚Äôre all in the space of like whatever‚Ä¶We don‚Äôt have the energy to keep stressing as much.‚Äù",News/US news,New York presses ahead with New Year‚Äôs Eve party despite record Covid cases ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/31/new-york-times-square-new-years-eve-party-covid-surge
1/1/2022,"With the first pick in the 2019 NBA draft, the New Orleans Pelicans made the obvious choice. Back then 19-year-old Zion Williamson, a Duke University freshman, was inarguably the most mesmerizing player in all of basketball, pro or amateur ‚Äì a 6ft 7in, 285lb flying sledgehammer who dunked with disturbing power, rejected shot attempts with stunning alacrity and otherwise defied the accepted physics of the game in ways too inconceivable not to retweet about in wonder. His rivalry game debut against North Carolina, already an NBA All-Star-level happening that featured former president Barack Obama and other bold-face names among the capacity crowd at Cameron Indoor Arena, became an even bigger deal when Williamson ripped a Nike shoe and limped off the floor with a knee injury a minute into the game.  These days, though, Williamson is a mixed bag. It‚Äôs not his talent that‚Äôs in doubt. (He‚Äôs rated among the league‚Äôs more productive players at both ends.) It‚Äôs his flagging durability, either a product of his unholy alloy of size and speed or the consequence of living in the fried food capital of the world. Williamson missed most of his rookie season with a torn right meniscus and has been dogged by injuries to his hands. He has yet to play a game this season because of a broken foot. All of this has made Williamson ripe for potshots from Charles Barkley and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal. Two years ago they roasted dire reports claiming Williamson had to relearn how to walk; in November they fell out laughing over footage of Williamson lumbering through a basic warm-up drill. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like me and Shaq had a baby,‚Äù Barkley cracked. ‚ÄúYou should not get hurt when you‚Äôre young.‚Äù All the while New Orleans continues to play mediocre ball. It‚Äôs enough to make you wonder if maybe the Pelicans got this wrong, if maybe instead of Williamson they should‚Äôve taken that other South Carolina hoops phenom. Compared to Williamson, Ja Morant, an old youth travel league teammate, was a 6ft 3in, 173lb wisp jumping to the pros from Murray State ‚Äì a ‚Äúmid-major‚Äù school that had won just three NCAA tournament games. And yet: In his two years there, Morant lost only four games and reached the tournament both seasons, leading the 12th-seeded Racers to an upset win over Marquette. As Williamson began his rookie year recovering from surgery to repair his meniscus, Morant ‚Äì who went second in the ‚Äô19 draft to the Memphis Grizzlies ‚Äì tiptoed out of Williamson‚Äôs shadow to claim Rookie of the Year honors. In 2020-21, Morant quietly willed the Grizzlies to the playoff precipice, single-handedly knocked off the Steph Curry-led Golden State Warriors in the NBA‚Äôs inaugural play-in tournament ‚Äì sealing the Grizzlies‚Äô first playoff appearance in four seasons. Against the top-seeded Jazz, Morant poured in another ace scoring effort to help steal a game on the road. This season the Grizzlies floor general with the dreaded hair and handles isn‚Äôt sneaking up on anyone. Prior to 2021-22 campaign, he declared himself a top-five point guard ‚Äì a boast that was met with some consternation. But all he‚Äôs done over the past week is state his case. On Monday at league-leading Phoenix, Morant capped a 33-point night with a twisting, fallaway, game-winning layup over two defenders. Two days later against the Lakers he went toe-to-toe with LeBron James from the three-point line, missing just once on the way to rallying the Grizzlies from a 14-point deficit to victory on the strength of a 41-point night. Incredibly, this all comes nine days after Morant heard Grizzlies fans call for him to return to the bench when he had an off night in a loss to Oklahoma City, his first game back from a three-week layoff with a sprained knee and a bout in the league‚Äôs health and safety protocol. For true Morant loyalists, the Lakers performance will hark to his college hot steaks against the likes of Belmont and SIU Edwardsville. For the rest of us, it‚Äôs more fodder for comparisons to Curry ‚Äì the ultimate underrated small college kid who turns his sleights into cannon fodder. ‚ÄúGo back to LA!‚Äù was his parting shot to the spectators who dared show up to FedEx Forum dressed in purple and gold. Morant has always been a wizard with the ball, equally adept at displacing defenders off the dribble or off a glance. Now he‚Äôs applying that same sorcery in service of his greatly improved long-distance stroke. Mindful of Morant‚Äôs explosive first step, Lakers defenders had to think twice before deciding whether to pick him up at the three-point line. That moment of hesitation was often enough to guarantee Morant wide-open looks against a flailing Avery Bradley or Russell Westbrook when Morant wasn‚Äôt crashing the offensive boards, blocking shots or spinning around more lost Lakers defenders in the paint. Overall he burned them for six makes, a career best. Most impressive: the Grizzlies, who have rebounded from an 9-10 start to leading the Southwest division, have the form of a playoff shoo-in. As Morant‚Äôs scoring average (24.5 points) and his three-point accuracy (38.3%) continue to climb, it appears the 22-year-old may have sold himself short. Forget the league‚Äôs top-five point guards. Right now Morant looks like a top-five player ‚Äì like a prime Derrick Rose, but with far greater judiciousness and restraint. Or, at the very least, Morant looks like he should‚Äôve been the top pick all along. Why he wasn‚Äôt has less to do with Morant‚Äôs talent than the LeBron-level hype around Williamson. What‚Äôs more, New Orleans tried building a team around a point guard before, and Chris Paul ‚Äì one of the best ever at that position ‚Äì could only do so much. Still: as hard as it is for any pro talent evaluator to justify passing on a big man many were touting as the next Charles Barkley, there remained some doubt about exactly what position Williamson would play. And that was before the questions about his eating habits. Citing his league sources, ESPN hoops reporter Tim MacMahon reckoned Williamson weighed around 330lbs ‚Äì and damned if that doesn‚Äôt come across in Williamson‚Äôs Mountain Dew commercials. While Williamson reaches for another beignet (allegedly), Morant seems to have stayed away from Memphis‚Äô famed BBQ and soul food joints. That figures, given Morant‚Äôs estimable reputation as a workout warrior who owes his own early viral fame to the improvised workouts dreamed up by his father, Tee ‚Äì a high school teammate of Ray Allen‚Äôs. But here‚Äôs really why Morant could‚Äôve gone No 1: basketball is a little man‚Äôs game now. And in a league where layups and threes rule, Morant, not Williamson, is the player with the greater upside. But then again it is still early days. Williamson‚Äôs career isn‚Äôt over yet, and who knows how much time he could buy back time with a better diet and discipline. Until he gets it back together, you can‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt see Ja Morant coming anymore. If you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a top player yet, at the very least you now know this: he‚Äôs hungry, too.",Sport/Sport,Ja Morant is showing he should have been the No 1 draft pick all along | Andrew Lawrence,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/31/ja-morant-memphis-grizzlies-star-zion-williamson
1/1/2022,"Lawyers representing a woman who has accused Prince Andrew of sexual abuse are demanding that he hand over documents explaining why he does not sweat. Virginia Giuffre‚Äôs legal team have requested a wealth of information from Andrew‚Äôs lawyers in response to his BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 when he said he visited a Pizza Express on the day of the claimed sexual encounter.  Giuffre is suing the Queen‚Äôs son for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. She claims she was trafficked by the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with the duke, and was pictured with the royal and his friend Ghislaine Maxwell during the period when the alleged intercourse is said to have taken place. Andrew has denied all the allegations. In the Newsnight interview, Andrew claimed he never got sweaty on a dancefloor with Giuffre in 2001, an argument used as evidence that he had never met her. Giuffre‚Äôs lawyers said in court documents that they want Prince Andrew to give them information about his ‚Äúalleged medical inability to sweat‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf Prince Andrew truly has no documents concerning his communications with Maxwell or Epstein, his travel to Florida, New York, or various locations in London, his alleged medical inability to sweat, or anything that would support the alibis he gave during his BBC interview, then continuing with discovery will not be burdensome to him at all,‚Äù the documents state. Andrew claimed that he did not sweat because he had an ‚Äúoverdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war, when I was shot at ‚Ä¶ it was almost impossible for me to sweat.‚Äù In the court documents, Giuffre‚Äôs lawyers also ask for information from the royal including any documents around ‚Äúallegations of sexual abuse‚Äù or ‚Äúextramarital sex‚Äù made against the duke. This week, Maxwell was found guilty on five of six charges for her involvement in Epstein‚Äôs sexual abuse of teenage girls. Prosecutors said Maxwell ‚Äúpreyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them and served them up to be sexually abused.‚Äù She is expected to receive a significant prison term, and is expected to appeal. The documents filed by Giuffre‚Äôs lawyers include a list of what they want from Andrew during the process of discovery, a pre-trial procedure through which each side can obtain evidence from the other. One of the requests is for ‚Äúall documents concerning your alleged medical condition of anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, or your inability to sweat‚Äù. Andrew‚Äôs lawyer, Andrew Brettler, has rejected this request on the grounds that it is ‚Äúharassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence‚Äù. Giuffre‚Äôs lawyers also want information on Andrew‚Äôs schedules and meetings in 2001, when the alleged abuse took place. Another request made is for ‚Äúall documents concerning defendant‚Äôs travel to or from, or presence in or on: a) Epstein‚Äôs planes; b) Florida; c) New York; d) New Mexico; e) the United States Virgin Islands; f) a Pizza Express located in Woking, England; or g) the Club Tramp nightclub, located in London, England‚Äù. Pizza Express is where the duke said he was the night Giuffre claims they had sex in London. Another request is for communications between Andrew and Epstein or Maxwell and their lawyers concerning ‚Äúsexual abuse‚Äù, a request rejected by Andrew‚Äôs lawyers as ‚Äúoverbroad, burdensome and oppressive‚Äù. Andrew‚Äôs legal team have rejected the requests for the documents citing various reasons including that the information is protected from disclosure by rights of privacy under the US constitution and article 8 of the European convention on human rights. His lawyers also state in papers filed to a New York court that some of the documents requested are already publicly available.",News/UK news,Giuffre lawyers seek details on Prince Andrew‚Äôs claimed inability to sweat,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/giuffre-lawyers-seek-details-on-prince-andrew-claimed-inability-to-sweat
1/1/2022,"The BBC has faced further complaints over its coverage of Ghislaine Maxwell‚Äôs conviction for recruiting and grooming teenage girls after an interview with her brother on Radio 4‚Äôs flagship news programme. Ian Maxwell made the case for his sister‚Äôs innocence on the Today programme, casting doubt on the testimony from victims and detailing plans for an appeal while Ghislaine awaits sentencing for trafficking young girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse between 1994 and 2004.  On Thursday, the corporation was forced to admit it had not met its own editorial standards during a BBC News interview with Alan Dershowitz, Epstein‚Äôs former lawyer who has also been accused of the sexual abuse of a minor. It was inundated with complaints after Dershowitz was introduced simply as a ‚Äúconstitutional lawyer‚Äù, and was then allowed to attack the credibility of Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Viewers were not told Giuffre and Dershowitz were engaged in a legal battle over the veracity of her claims that he was part of a group of powerful men to whom Epstein offered her for sex. She has also made similar claims against Prince Andrew. Both men strenuously deny the allegations. During a five-minute interview, Ian Maxwell said while the trial had heard ‚Äúheart-rending testimonies‚Äù his view was ‚Äúthat Ghislaine had nothing to do with it‚Äù. ‚ÄúThese were Epstein‚Äôs crimes and he‚Äôs not here to pay that price, and she has been made to pay the price that he should have paid,‚Äù he added. Pressed by the interviewer Mishal Husain on whether the women who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell were lying, he replied: ‚ÄúOf course, the prosecution didn‚Äôt put into evidence the prior interviews they had with these accusers, which showed a completely different case. Memory is faulty, and so, in my view, the trial that has occurred was not a fair trial from Ghislaine‚Äôs perspective. And that is why she‚Äôs going to appeal, and I think she‚Äôll be successful,.‚Äù He said the appeal would be based on ‚Äúlegal grounds, both in terms of pre-trial process and indeed the trial process itself‚Äù. He also claimed that the months his sister had spent awaiting trial since her arrest at her luxurious 63-hectare (156-acre) property in New Hampshire in July 2020 had taken a toll. Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, wrote on Twitter that those who gave character references to those convicted as part of ‚Äúso-called grooming gangs‚Äù, many of which were from a British Pakistani background, were ‚Äúrightly shamed‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow is that those supporting the convicted child sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell are being given air time on national media?‚Äù The author and criminal barrister who uses the pen name Secret Barrister tweeted: ‚ÄúI cannot understand why #r4today is providing a platform for family and friends of Ghislaine Maxwell to proclaim her innocence and undermine the jury‚Äôs verdicts. Is this service to be made available to all convicted sex offenders?‚Äù. In the wake of his sister‚Äôs conviction, Ian Maxwell has also given interviews with Sky News and the Daily Telegraph. A spokesperson for the BBC said it had ‚Äúcovered the guilty verdict against Ghislaine Maxwell extensively, including interviews with her victims on multiple outlets‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe interview on the Today Programme with Ian Maxwell was about the family‚Äôs decision to appeal the verdict; he was robustly challenged and his arguments were critiqued directly afterwards by a barrister,‚Äù it added.",News/US news,BBC criticised for giving Ian Maxwell airtime to defend sister Ghislaine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/31/ian-maxwell-bbc-radio-4-today-interview-sister-ghislaine
