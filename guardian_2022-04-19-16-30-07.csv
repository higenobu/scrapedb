4/19/2022,"Refugees resettled in New Zealand from Australia will be unable to return even if they’ve become New Zealand citizens, the Morrison government has announced. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, revealed on Tuesday that Australia will prevent the resettlement deal for 450 refugees from becoming a “back door” by stopping would-be travellers at the border. In an interview with Radio National Andrews struggled to explain how such a ban would be enforced, after home affairs department officials warned in March legislation would probably be required. But Labor’s shadow minister, Kristina Keneally, gave bipartisan support for the ban, promising to “close that back door by legislation or by regulation” if elected in May. In March the Morrison and Ardern governments inked the deal, first agreed in principle between Julia Gillard and John Key in 2013. Labor labelled the move a humiliating backflip, after senior Coalition figures arguing for years that the deal would encourage dangerous boat journeys to Australia by asylum seekers and refugees. Refugees resettled in New Zealand from Australia will have the same rights as others, including pathways to citizenship after five years, raising questions about whether they could get special subclass 444 visas that allow New Zealanders to remain indefinitely in Australia to live, work or study. Asked how Australia would prevent refugees who become New Zealand citizens returning to Australia, Andrews said “that door is shut”. “We will never allow them to settle here and the New Zealand government is aware of that,” she told Radio National. “They have said that it is up to us as to how we manage our borders.” “They have been clear they don’t agree to it – that is fine – we have also been clear that they will never be allowed to settle here in Australia.” Andrews was asked repeatedly how the ban would be enforced, before stating “it will be a border policy matter that they will not be able to settle here. “They will be stopped at the border, just like we don’t let people come in who don’t meet the requirements to enter into Australia.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Andrews explained that “we know who they are” because they are “part of a resettlement arrangement”, implying that there will be a standing list of refugees resettled in Australia banned from re-entry. In March, New Zealand immigration minister, Kris Faafoi, said in relation to the deal that “we didn’t make any concessions”. “We’ve always said that this is an issue for Australia, in terms of whether it allows these refugees to visit Australia. I think they’ve made a decision, I think I’ll leave that to them to flesh out their arrangements.” In March, the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, told Senate Estimates that New Zealand had left it “entirely up to us” how to enforce Australia’s borders. Pezzullo said there is “no other way” to achieve the ban except through legislation, warning that he needed an “absolute tool” to enforce the policy for refugees not to resettle in Australia. Such a bill would “make it unambiguously clear as a matter of statutory law that it would be impossible for a person to take advantage of arriving here on a 444 visa, once they were entitled to that as a New Zealand citizen, and ever permanently settling here”, he said. Pezzullo added that when the Turnbull government had proposed it, it was rejected. “So, if I can, I will just take this opportunity, in the dying days of this parliament, to say that, however the parliament is in future constituted and whoever forms government, if someone can get around to giving me the tools to enforce the policies that you both agree on, I’d be very grateful.” On Tuesday, Keneally said the home affairs department had “admitted” that the door from New Zealand to Australia was not closed because “they couldn’t name one legislation or regulatory change as to how that would happen”. Keneally accused the government of having backflipped on the New Zealand deal to “sandbag those inner-city Liberal seats that are up against those teal [independent] candidates”. “Look, we will implement the deal. We will implement the deal in full and we will close that back door by legislation or by regulation.”",News/Australia news,Refugees resettled in New Zealand from Australia to be permanently banned from returning,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/refugees-resettled-in-new-zealand-from-australia-to-be-permanently-banned-from-returning
4/19/2022,"Doctor Miranda Ruiz went to work one Friday in September knowing she was likely to be arrested. The prosecutor of Tartagal, a city in Argentina’s province of Salta, had announced his intentions the day before: that Ruiz, 34, would be detained for administering an abortion – in a country that had legalised the procedure less than a year earlier. “I couldn’t believe it, it was very surreal,” said Ruiz. “It’s crazy to jail a doctor who performed a legal abortion when there is a national law that permits it.” Ruiz had been working in a drop-in clinic in Tartagal when a 21-year-old came in. A team of doctors assessed the woman, who was 22 weeks pregnant, and determined she met the criteria for a late-stage abortion – her health was at risk. Ruiz prescribed misoprostol, a drug that induces miscarriage, and admitted the woman.. Days later the woman’s family filed a criminal complaint. Ruiz was released a few hours after her arrest, but the charges against her have since been broadened to include providing an abortion without consent – something she denies. “The person puts pills under her tongue for half an hour, and then swallows. That procedure is repeated every three hours. No one can force someone to abort in those circumstances,” says Ruiz, one of just a handful of doctors to provide abortions in Tartagal. In December 2020, Argentina legalised all abortion up to 14 weeks, and in later stages of pregnancy if life or health is at risk, or in rape cases. It was a victory for reproductive rights campaigners. But feminists, human rights groups and government officials say Ruiz’s case is an example of the battles still being waged in Argentina. The minister of women, gender and diversity, Elizabeth Gómez Alcorta, has called the charges an attempt to “discipline” doctors who are guaranteeing a right. The national Secretariat on Human Rights Office says: “It is extremely problematic for the rule of law that those who comply with current regulations are criminalised, simply because some people do not agree with those regulations.” In the first year since abortion was legalised, 64,164 terminations were recorded. The number of health centres that provided abortions increased from 907 to 1,347. In the province of Buenos Aires, home to a third of the population, the number of municipalities offering abortions jumped from 38% to 96%, according to government data. “The symbolic effect of the law has been strong, at least in our province,” says Soledad Deza, a renowned feminist lawyer, who heads the Tucumán-based organisation Mujeres x Mujeres (Women for Women). Tucumán, a very conservative province, saw the number of official abortions jump from about 600 a year to more than 4,000 after legalisation. “The barriers have dramatically gone down,” says Deza. But other provinces have recorded far fewer abortions, and the national government has had to defend the legislation. At least 37 legal challenges have been mounted since the law passed; 26 have been thrown out, four were archived and seven are awaiting judgment. “The first barrier is information,” says Patricia Cuomo, of the feminist organisation La Hoguera in Tierra del Fuego. “There isn’t a single public institution in any city here that has signage or graphic information explaining how to access an abortion.” In Rio Grande, the province’s largest city, a helpline that tries to dissuade women from having an abortion is promoted in the public hospital. All the hospital’s doctors have declared themselves conscientious objectors, notes Cuomo. The law allows individual doctors to opt out on moral grounds but the institution has to ensure access to an abortion. Women are often sent to another city for late-stage abortions, in this case the provincial capital, Ushuaia, 220km away. Gabriela Chavez, a nurse in Resistencia, the capital of the northern province Chaco, says there is a fear among health professionals of a backlash to providing abortions but things are changing. “A few years ago, you’d walk down the halls of the hospital and people might say, there goes that aborter – but now it’s something that is much more accepted,” she says. But Deza says anti-abortion campaigners are now targeting later-stage pregnancies, which has potential implications for younger women. Argentina has a high rate of teenage pregnancy which are often the result of abuse and disclosed late. In Ruiz’s case, a local politician publicised the case through social media. Ruiz said misinformation spread widely, including the claim that the foetus cried. Ruiz is fighting to have her charges thrown out by the court. In the meantime, she continues to see women seeking abortions at the clinic. There’s an uptick in demand since her arrest. “All of this had the unexpected effect of strengthening the attention we give to [abortion],” she says.

4/19/2022,"West Ham’s hopes of winning the Europa League have suffered a setback with David Moyes facing a defensive crisis after Issa Diop suffered an ankle injury that could rule him out for the rest of the season. Diop picked up a knock during the final stages of last Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Burnley and initial tests have indicated that the defender could be out for eight weeks with ligament damage, leaving Craig Dawson as West Ham’s only fit centre-back. With Angelo Ogbonna and Kurt Zouma already unavailable for the season that leaves Moyes with a major selection headache before his side’s Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt. West Ham, who are seventh in the Premier League, will need to be creative as they attempt to win their first European semi-final since 1976. One solution could be to move Ben Johnson, who can play in both full-back positions, alongside Dawson. Another would be to promote Jamal Baptiste or Aji Alese from the academy. Baptiste, 18, and Alese, 21, started when West Ham lost to Dinamo Zagreb in December. Declan Rice can also play as a centre-back, though Moyes is reluctant to move him out of central midfield. Another option would be to switch from a 4-2-3-1 to a back three. West Ham are clinging on to hope that Diop will overcome the problem before the season is over. However questions will be asked about their failure to bring in extra cover at centre-back during the January transfer window. Ogbonna has been out since November with a knee injury and Zouma, who was out with a hamstring injury during Christmas, was sidelined with an ankle injury this month.",Sport/Football,West Ham facing Europa League defensive crisis after Issa Diop ruled out,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/west-ham-europa-league-defensive-crisis-issa-diop-ruled-out
4/19/2022,"For Sean Dyche the road to salvation would begin at Rock City in Nottingham. Liberated from the treadmill of management for the first time in almost a decade after being sacked by Burnley, Dyche enjoyed his first weekend of freedom having drinks with friends before taking in a bill of Manchester tribute acts. Camera‑phone footage from Sunday night shows him swaying along to a band called The Clone Roses. Which on reflection feels about perfect. Given everything else going on at the moment, we may not have been ready as a society for the idea of a sad Sean Dyche. Dyche’s year-long New York sabbatical. Dyche’s lonely, penitent pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. A tearful Dyche addressing his adoring public one last time from the steps of Burnley town hall, as mourners lay scarves and candles at his feet. Nobody wants any of this. Dyche grooving along to (Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister on a shaky camera phone: nature has healed. Perhaps, on reflection, this was the defining motif of Dyche’s decade at Burnley: that striking point of difference, the absence of pretensions or affectations, elite football with a recognisably human face. Dyche never claimed to have all the answers, never obsessed over enemies and agendas, never pretended that football was any more serious than it is, never stopped joking about signing Lionel Messi. And in retrospect his departure represents the loss of something vital and tonal to this great glossy global entertainment product, something that may not be recovered in a hurry. Seven years ago, when Dyche took Burnley down for the first time, it was basically fine. The club’s finances were in decent shape. There was patience and potential and a vision. You get relegated, you have another go. These days the revenue streams are too essential, the thirst for returns too urgent, the competition too unforgiving. The club is laden with debt, the football poor, the squad a mixture of the good enough, the once-good enough and the not-quite good enough. The end could quite conceivably have come sooner. Naturally a good deal of mythologising nonsense will be talked about this Burnley team in years to come: that they were an ugly long-ball side, that they were dirty and ill-tempered, that the failure to refine or adapt their brutish style of football ultimately proved their undoing. Dyche himself feels ripe for caricature: the gravelly voiced, worm-eating dinosaur with the look of a nightclub bouncer and tactics to match. The truth is that many of Burnley’s critics clearly did not watch them very much. Dyche always hated possession for its own sake, wanted his teams to get the ball forward, but he was not remotely fussed how they did it. They could cut you open, skin you down the flanks or shock you with a counterattack. They have Aaron Lennon, Dwight McNeil and Maxwel Cornet. They have had two red cards in five seasons. Dyche himself is one of the most thoughtful and sincere coaches in the game, never more so than when standing up to his club’s own fans in 2020 for their racist “white lives matter” plane banner. Meanwhile he has been forced to rebuild almost an entire squad on a budget of about £750 while his owners load the club with takeover debt. The problem was not that Burnley failed to evolve or adapt. The problem is that Burnley were Burnley: a cash-poor small-town club in a sea of nation-states and billionaire mercenaries, desperately trying to keep its head above water. There is a certain bitter irony in the fact that the man Dyche succeeded at Burnley is now one of the main architects of their downfall: Newcastle’s Eddie Howe, a manager often hailed as the archetype of the modern holistic young English coach, now playing fantasy football with Saudi Arabian money. Who, ultimately, was the principled one? All of which simply embellishes the sparkling, visceral miracle of Peak Burnley, the house that Sean built, a team that felt like a doomed historical artefact almost from the moment it came into existence. And for all the condescension and metropolitan snobbery there was a real beauty to Peak Burnley, not perhaps the classical beauty of perfect curves and marble nudes but the industrial beauty of order and function, harmony and collective effort, 11 moving as one. Its passing marks perhaps one of the last genuine attempts by a Premier League club to express its local identity through football itself. For better and worse one could feel Burnley, the town and its people, in the way its football team passed and tackled and ran and fought and went about its business. That connection will endure at a structural level, not least through Burnley’s impressive community department. But it is hard to imagine there will ever be another elite team so thoroughly of its place, composed so overwhelmingly of British and Irish players, playing such distinctively local football. It is fine to feel happy or sad about this, by the way; or perhaps as binary as Dyche himself, tapping his toes to Fool’s Gold as he contemplates a career of Championship rescue jobs. The world is connected and borders are fluid and money seeps in. And so, like Pulis’s Stoke and Allardyce’s Bolton and Curbishley’s Charlton, the era of Dyche’s Burnley has gone the way of all flesh. Do not mourn the fact that it died. Cherish the fact it lived.",Sport/Football,"Sean Dyche gave us the gift of Peak Burnley – for that, we owe him thanks | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/sean-dyche-burnley-manager-premier-league
4/19/2022,"Only nine months after his last record was released, Vince Staples is back with another. While the 28-year-old California rapper is known for his prolific output – he already has four albums under his belt, a further six mixtapes and EPs, and a host of features on other people’s tracks – even by his standards, that’s a rapid release schedule. Sitting on a Zoom call in a San Francisco hotel room, however, in a brief break before another date on his North American tour with Tyler, the Creator, Staples seems entirely unfazed. A little disinterested, if anything, in going through the requisite promo motions. “It’s all good, man,” he says. “It’s all the same. We’ve been here before. I’m just trying to execute it, to bring the things we have planned to fruition.” His previous offering was self-titled; this one is called Ramona Park Broke My Heart, a nod to the Long Beach neighbourhood – just south of Los Angeles – that Staples was raised in. “Songs are just songs,” he states, when I ask if and how the two works relate. He doesn’t live far from the area today; there was no great return while he penned the album. “Home means the same to me as everybody else,” he says, vaguely. “The title is metaphorical: everyone knows home and heartbreak, those things affect your life no matter who you are.” Staples’s disinclination to riff on the details feels a stark contrast from his approach in interviews past. He is known for his droll sense of humour, often answering questions with witty one liners, yet today he’s reserved and introspective. And while he has previously spoken about his early years in Ramona Park – the reality of the gangland violence and poverty that shaped his adolescence – now he’d rather let the record do the talking. “I feel like a lot of the time,” says Staples, “we get this voyeurism: ‘Ah man, it must be so hard,’ or, ‘I can’t imagine growing up where you grew up, experiencing what you did.’ People look at us like we’re entertainment and not people. That’s how we look at rap music. That’s how we look at Black people. “There’s perpetual violence,” he continues. “Our people constantly die. Meanwhile, we’re entertaining beefs and people’s misfortunes … We engage in trauma porn for people obsessed with poverty and violence who don’t know it, don’t digest it or really care about it.” Staples is tired of his music – and rap and hip-hop more broadly – being consumed only as entertainment at a surface level. It’s the industry – audiences and listeners alike – he argues, who giddily perpetuate the glamorisation and glorification of violence.“The truth is, someone can like my music,” Staples says, “but if I did one of these things that’s talked about in music for survival I would be shunned by the world.” Audiences will happily sing along, he says, until confronted with the reality. “But it happens every day,” he says. “We just don’t care about people like me and where I come from – we just pretend to.” His discomfort is compounded by the fact that Staples doesn’t go in for the trappings of the A-list lifestyle. He doesn’t drink or do drugs. You won’t see him at celeb parties or awards ceremonies, never mixing his personal life with what he sees as business. Money may have alleviated the pressures on his family, but success doesn’t always sit right. “We like celebrity and ingenuity and people being rich and famous,” he says. “People won’t listen to folks off the street with the purest form of art and expression. It’s not about them. There’s only interest in you because of your status, something symbolic when you make it.” There is no great divergence on the album when it comes to Staples’s lyrical dexterity: true to form, he explores complex ideas – from his relationship with violence to his struggles navigating the music business – with a sharpness, often in a tight two-minute runtime. He finds space to offer up a dose of vulnerability, too: “Money ain’t everythin’ / But I promise it help the pain”. Stylistically, it’s a visceral affair. The album’s first track – The Beach – opens with seaside sounds and mellow pop melodies. Sixty seconds later, it ends with a spray of gunshots. While the rappers Lil Baby and Ty Dolla $ign and Mustard make feature appearances, it’s the other voices woven through the tracks that feel more resonant. Witnesses to and victims of violence speak on samples taken from news reports and DVDs. Some tracks are comprised solely of these recordings. There is audio of Monster Kody, later known as Sanyika Shakur, a one-time gang member turned activist and author. Another track, Nameless, is a clip of Cynthia Nunn, who founded a non-profit after losing loved ones to gang violence : “You have to eat. You have to pay bills. You have to survive. So when you get used to pulling a trigger on somebody it’s not hard to pick up a gun and just shoot. You know? It’s not hard after a while.” “All of these skits are from a long time ago,” Staples says. The samples were recorded in the 70s, 80s and early 90s. “They’re to show how circumstances and situations don’t really change as much as we like to pretend they do.” These people, he says, come from a similar place – geographically and in their experiences – to Staples and his family. “Mostly they were interviewed and put on the news so people could ask: ‘Why are you the way you are?’” Staples says. “Nobody was asking why their circumstances are the way they are. As people listen to my songs, they might not understand that what I’m talking about is real life. It’s not entertainment. These voices matter. Them being heard might change how you hear my output.” Staples expects a lot of himself, and his audience, too. He bemoans the shallowness of the way his music is often listened to, while he creates with precision and purpose: “People don’t understand nuance … Here’s this dude talking about the ghetto, again, but so much of this I’ve never spoken about before, with this perspective.” Does that create some sort of tension for him in the industry? “Not at all,” he says. “I’ve never cared about what people make of what I’ve done. Each project is different. I cut myself off at the leg sometimes with the way I work: I don’t make my music for people who won’t understand it.” Staples continues to diversify his creative output. As well as two records in 12 months, a graphic novel is due to be published later this year and he supports a YMCA programme; there’s also a Netflix show in production. Music may have been his entry point into the creative world – rapping required little in the way of resources – but he is far from precious about his stardom. “All I have to speak about is myself in my music,” he says with total certainty. “I’m not well versed in anything else. As soon as that’s not enough for me to make music – or it no longer feels right – I’ll immediately stop doing it.” Ramona Park Broke My Heart is out now on Blacksmith/Motown UK.",Arts/Music,Vince Staples: ‘I’m talking about is real life.

4/19/2022,"On 23 August 2022, it will be 50 years since my parents, my brother and I landed in Stansted airport as refugees, expelled and made penniless by Uganda’s General Idi Amin. A brutal dictator, he made sure that Ugandan Asians, who had lived for three generations in the country, were stripped of all their assets and kicked out. In an August 1972 edition of the Uganda Argus, Amin was reported as asking the British government to take “responsibility” for British passport holders in Uganda, because they were “sabotaging the economy of the country”. He gave Asians three months to leave the country from 5 August 1972 and said that they “only milked the cow, but they did not feed it”. The loss of Uganda’s Asians, who accounted for most of the tax revenue, sent the economy into a slump – it was an act of economic self-harm created by a leader who had initially been backed by the British. The British government thought Amin was “their man”, until he turned on it. As part of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the Ugandan Asians in Britain, I have delved into local newspapers of the time to see how they framed the migration of the roughly 28,000 Ugandan Asians who were forced to leave places such as Jinja, Mbale and Kampala in Uganda. The British government at the time set up the Uganda Resettlement Board to control the inflow of Ugandan Asian refugees to prevent, what the Observer at the time called “a backlash of white resentment by heading the newcomers away from the areas of coloured immigrant concentration which already exist”. The newspaper went on to say that “predictable twitches of this backlash have already come from … Enoch Powell, the National Front and the Monday Club”. We must also not forget that government papers from the time show that proposals were even put on the table to send the Ugandan Asians to the Solomon or Falkland Islands to appease the political right. However, despite the predictable reaction by people like Powell, the British public generally welcomed the Ugandan Asians, and the British Council of Churches and faith groups formed themselves into the Co-ordinating Committee for the welfare of Evacuees from Uganda. Church halls were fitted out as temporary reception areas and volunteers came forward to assist the new arrivals who had turned up in clothes that were unsuitable for the oncoming winter. Some wore shorts, others Safari suits, with many in western clothes, such was the influence of British culture on them. By late October 1972, about 18,000 Ugandan Asians had passed through various resettlement camps, and my family had been assigned to the Stradishall Royal Air Force camp in Surrey. The Evening Standard stated on 2 November 1972 that at least 7,000 of them had already been moved into cities and rehoused, with many finding jobs, so that they could move their lives on. Some families had to wait only a few weeks for resettlement, while others waited for months. In the last few days, Priti Patel, (also of Ugandan Asian heritage), launched the Rwanda relocation scheme for those (mainly) single male refugees arriving on boats and on to the shores of our country. In 50 years, our country has gone from resettling Ugandan Asian refugees within weeks and getting them into employment, to planning to send refugees 4,000 miles away to a Rwandan government that has a very questionable human rights record. I can only imagine what would have happened to me if Amin was to eject Asians from Uganda today and if I had arrived on to the shores of Dover, simply because I had a link to the colonial legacy of Britain’s involvement in east Africa. You can bet your bottom dollar I would be sent packing. It is true that one difference between then and now is that most Ugandan Asians had British passports; but if the Windrush scandal has taught us anything, it’s that such distinctions mean little to the modern-day Home Office. Successive British governments have slowly dehumanised refugees, driven by a fear of alienating parts of our population who believe that “Britain is full” – a nonsensical claim that the far right has been making for years. This is the same “full Britain” that rightly opened the gateway to up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, entitling them to receive public funds such as universal credit, and access to public services such as schools and healthcare services. This is in direct contrast to other refugees, such as those from Iraq and Iran, who survive on voucher support and cannot work, many of whom have languished for years, awaiting a decision on their asylum claims. They have been made to feel powerless, hopeless and disregarded by a system in which certain refugees are welcome but others are dehumanised and treated with utter disdain. Patel should never forget that the Ugandan Asians were settled and welcomed under the Conservative government of Edward Heath. He firmly stood against the xenophobia and racial intolerance of people such as Powell. This home secretary, it seems, is willing to give up Conservative ideals of providing a safe haven to the powerless. Instead, her posturing against refugees shames those of us who see no hierarchy in preserving the dignity of people. It would make Amin proud, knowing that he could no longer be maligned for ejecting a whole section of people. Today, in 2022, our home secretary is also willing to physically move large numbers of vulnerable people out of our country, to put them of sight and out of mind.

4/19/2022,"Joanna CannonThe Borough Press, £16.99, pp400 “We should never have left Wales… now we find ourselves slap bang in the middle of a Stephen King film,” Linda’s dreadful mother, Eunice, tells her. Linda is in her 40s, living with her dull husband, Terry, on an estate in the town of Hexford and working part-time in a charity shop, when the bodies of young women start turning up. The police are making investigations and launching appeals, but Linda and her neighbours in Cavendish Avenue know the killer must be someone close to home. And while they say there’s safety in numbers, Linda is wary, “because you can never quite be sure of who’s wandering around in those numbers with you”. A Tidy Ending is Joanna Cannon’s third novel, after the bestselling The Trouble With Goats and Sheep and Three Things About Elsie, and her memoir about her time as a junior doctor, Breaking and Mending. It is a rare beast indeed: a genuinely funny, and moving, novel about a serial killer. Linda, Cannon’s narrator, is quick to win hearts. Palpably lonely, she’s the sort of person who never quite gets social interactions right – who laughs too loud, doesn’t look quite right, says the wrong thing. But she’s perennially, heartbreakingly positive, always putting a happy spin on the constant stream of rejections that come her way. Cannon is excellent on the little details that make up a quiet, empty life, as Terry heads off after dinner to watch some more telly, leaving Linda “alone with the smell of a thousand other empty plates to come… the washing machine spinning out the soundtrack of our lives”, as she ponders how “it’s the small rituals, the empty habits you build over the years, brick by brick, that end up being your life”. That second bleach of the sink. That second vacuuming of the hallway. Linda might be lonely and overlooked, but she’s also got her own, strangely clear-sighted way of looking at the world, and she watches her neighbours as the Hexford Strangler continues on their rampage and as the bodies start to pile up. We learn more about why she and her horrific mother – “the kind of person who had far more coasters than people she knew”, who “says sharing intimate details of your health problems is a way to bring people closer together” – left Wales. We look at the reactions when local busybody Malcolm organises a community meeting about the killings and neighbours start to eye each other suspiciously. Cannon’s version of suburbia is wonderfully creepy and claustrophobic – a curtain-twitching, darkly funny tale with a gloriously sinister twist. Linda is still tugging at my heartstrings a little, days after finishing. Jacqueline SutherlandPoint Blank, £16.99, pp384 Jacqueline Sutherland’s debut has a very different lonely woman at its heart. Kat’s husband has recently died in a car crash. She is miserably isolated in the countryside until her one friend, Ginny, urges her to join a club for the recently widowed, where she meets a man bringing up his daughter alone. Kat has always wanted children and jumps at the chance of an instant family, but is Nico really who he seems? And is Kat? This is a twisty, chilling look at the lengths one woman will go to get what she wants. Will DeanHodder & Stoughton, £16.99, pp384 In Will Dean’s First Born, we meet Molly, an identical twin whose sister, Katie, has just been murdered in New York. Molly has always been the less adventurous of the two, cautious and frightened of life, but she forces herself to leave London to try to find out what really happened to her twin. As the New York police investigation seems to stall, Molly turns detective, leaving her comfort zone to interrogate Katie’s teachers, friends and boyfriends in her quest for the truth. An identical twin mystery is always entertaining and Dean, author of the excellent Tuva Moodyson series of Sweden-set thrillers and the standalone The Last Thing to Burn, handles his plot with skill. Molly, properly alone for the first time in her life, is a complex, intriguing protagonist – and Dean has plenty of surprises up his sleeve for the unwary reader.

4/19/2022,"Labor has given a clear signal it will end the basics card as a compulsory scheme, allowing more than 20,000 welfare recipients in the Northern Territory to exit the program. Anthony Albanese last year committed to scrapping the cashless debit card, which operates in trial sites in Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia and until recently was run solely by the private banking provider Indue. The opposition has since launched a scare campaign claiming the Coalition plans to place age pensioners on to the card, despite the Morrison government repeatedly ruling out such a move and the prime minister labelling it a “despicable lie” on Tuesday. The cashless debit card is a form of income management that usually quarantines up to 80% of a person’s welfare payment on to a card that can’t be used to withdraw cash, or buy alcohol or gambling products. While it is supposed to reduce social harms, the government has yet to present definitive evidence it is effective, while other experts have panned it. Meanwhile critics say it is causing stigma and stress to participants, breaches human rights principles and locks cardholders out of the cheaper local cash economy. Similarly, the basics card program quarantines a person’s payments – usually 50% – on to a card. It was initially given to First Nations people in remote communities under the Howard government’s 2007 NT intervention, but Labor expanded it to a wider cohort of jobseekers – and not just Aboriginal people – in 2010. While the opposition’s cashless debit card commitment has garnered the most publicity – in part because of the political fight over the Labor scare campaign about pensioners – there are still more welfare recipients subjected to the basics card, which is government-run and longstanding policy. Both schemes have high numbers of Indigenous participants. Asked on Tuesday by Guardian Australia what Labor would do about the basics card, the party’s social services spokesperson, Linda Burney, confirmed it would be voluntary. “Our fundamental principle on the basics card and the cashless debit card, it should be on a voluntary basis,” she said. “If people want to be on those sorts of income management, then that’s their decision. It’s not up to Labor or anyone else to tell them what to do. At the moment it’s compulsion and that’s not Labor’s position.” Burney said in the case of the cashless debit card – being trialled in Ceduna, South Australia; the East Kimberley and Goldfields regions of Western Australia; and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region, Queensland – the scheme would be replaced by wraparound services such as financial counselling. Government data shows there are 24,018 people on the basics card in the Northern Territory, with only 2,400 of those people on the card on a “voluntary basis”. The others have been placed on the card after being classified by Centrelink as long-term unemployed or “disengaged youth”. There are also 1,723 basics cardholders across small income management schemes in other parts of the country. The Coalition has been calling on the opposition to “come clean” on its plans for “income management and the basics card” in May. It remains committed to income management, saying that the card is supported by the communities where it operates. It is seeking to move those in the Northern Territory from the basics card to the cashless debit card, which it believes is a superior platform. In December, Guardian Australia reported that people in the NT community of Maningrida were unable to buy food and other supplies after an internet outage that left people on income management particularly exposed.",News/Australia news,Cashless welfare: Labor vows to end compulsory use of basics card,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/cashless-welfare-labor-vows-to-end-compulsory-use-of-basics-card
4/19/2022,"There are few mammals that capture our imagination more than the rare and elusive snow leopard. Listed as vulnerable on the red list of threatened species, fewer than 7,000 Panthera uncia are thought to remain across the high mountains of Asia. Of these, an estimated 5% live in Tajikistan’s Pamir mountains, the third-highest ecosystem in the world after the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges. Here, against the odds, the leopards appear to be thriving. “In Tajikistan, the situation with snow leopards is optimistic because the population is visibly increasing,” says Khalil Karimov, a wildlife biologist and scientific adviser to the Association of Nature Conservation Organisations of Tajikistan (Ancot). “We have between 350 and 450 cats, although the exact number is impossible to say due to the nature of the leopards and the remote environment they inhabit.” A landlocked, mountainous country bordering China and Afghanistan, Tajikistan lay for decades at the eastern limit of the Soviet Union. But in 1991, when the USSR disintegrated, the country slid into a five-year civil war that cost an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 lives and forced a million more from their homes. In its wake, the country’s rare mountain ungulates that the leopards prey on – Asiatic ibex, Marco Polo sheep, markhor and urial – were hunted to near extinction. In recent years, however, a network of grassroots initiatives have reversed this decline – and that of other species – and Tajikistan now has five community-run conservancies covering a total of 150,000 hectares (580 sq miles), with more in various stages of formation. One of these success stories is the M–Sayod markhor conservancy in the western Pamirs, whose 35,000mountainous hectares border northern Afghanistan. The family-run reserve has seen a tenfold increase in Bukharan markhor (Capra falconeri heptneri), a wild goat with emblematic spiral horns, since the conservancy was founded in 2005. “We used to hunt markhor for meat – we didn’t know they were an endangered species,” says Khudoydod Mulloyorov, whose father, Devlatkhan, founded the reserve. “Life was so difficult back then; people hunted to survive. Afghans even used to cross the river to hunt snow leopards and sell their skins.” More markhor means more of their main predator, the snow leopard. In 2013, six were recorded here, the highest density at that time in the world. A team returning in 2016 identified 10 cats in the same area. Mulloyorov, a shy, taciturn man, lights up when asked about the leopards. “I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve seen a snow leopard, but every time I see one it makes me feel alive,” he says. Unlike countries such as India, wildlife tourism is almost nonexistent in Tajikistan. Its proximity to Afghanistan and a lingering, unjustified fear of “the Stans” puts all but the most intrepid off. With scant income from tourism and few major foreign donors, Tajikistan’s snow leopards have an unlikely saviour. “Ninety-nine per cent of the funding for conservation in Tajikistan comes from foreign trophy hunting,” says Karimov. “Before, people used to go into the mountains and kill anything they could, but now they protect them because they have financial value.” Karimov estimates that foreign trophy hunters contribute millions of pounds a year to the Tajik economy, with the government setting annual quotas for shooting markhor, ibex, wild boar, Marco Polo sheep and urials. In 2021, the M-Sayod conservancy was awarded three of Tajikistan’s 12 markhor licences, with hunters paying between £100,000 and £145,000 to shoot one goat, 30% of which went directly to the reserve. In this remote mountainous region, where jobs are scarce and most families have at least one person working in Russia (a flow of money hit first by Covid and now the invasion of Ukraine), this income is a lifeline for many. “Without trophy hunting, there would be no conservation here,” says Mulloyorov. “Thanks to hunting, we employ 20 people and improve local infrastructure.” Ismatullo Habibuloev, head of the local village, Zhigar, agrees. “This year, the conservancy funded a new medical centre and built bear-proof fencing around our fields. We have very few other sources of income here – the benefits to the community are enormous. People value our wildlife now.” On the Alichur plateau, a largely ethnic Kyrgyz region in the far north-east of the country, an ex-hunter called Mahan Atabaev runs a 92,000-hectare reserve. With an average altitude of 4,000 metres and winter temperatures regularly hitting -50C (-58F), it is one of the harshest inhabited places on Earth. In 2012, when the conservancy was established, 106 Marco Polo – the world’s biggest sheep – were recorded here. Now there are more than 500. Numbers of ibex have also increased. Mirroring the pattern at M-Sayod, as Marco Polo and ibex have prospered, so have snow leopards. In 2011, none of the cats were recorded here. In 2017, camera traps recorded nine. In the village of Alichur, the average income – for the few people who do have jobs – is £30 a month. Most people are subsistence herders, and the ban on hunting was not welcomed initially. “At first, people were against us as we are nomad people and hunting is our culture,” says Atabaev. “But after the first trophy hunters came in 2014, we bought the village 120 sacks of flour and coal, and people saw the benefits.” Karimov argues that it would take a great number of tourists – and all the environmental impact that entails – to bring in the same amount of income. These days the biggest threat to Tajikistan’s wildlife is not poaching, but the climate crisis. Of Tajikistan’s 8,000 glaciers, a third are at risk of disappearing entirely by 2050. These alarming glacial retreats are causing the climate in the Pamirs to become increasingly unpredictable, with longer, colder winters and drier summers. Last winter it reached -63C on the Alichur plateau, and Bash Gumbez, a village of 44 households, lost 700 yaks and 1,000 sheep to the cold. Conditions like this also spell disaster for the wild herds that snow leopards depend on to survive. For now – as unpalatable as it may be – trophy hunting is proving a successful model of conservation in Tajikistan. “I have many issues with trophy hunting, but we don’t have the luxury not to do it,” says Karimov. “And without this level of sustainable trophy hunting, our populations of ungulates, and subsequently snow leopards, would rapidly decrease.” Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent’s report on snow leopards in Tajikistan for Costing the Earth will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 19 April at 15.30 Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/World news,Why trophy hunters in Tajikistan are unlikely saviours of the snow leopard ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/trophy-hunters-tajikistan-unlikely-saviours-snow-leopard-conservation-aoe
