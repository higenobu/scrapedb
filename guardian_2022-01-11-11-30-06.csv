1/11/2022,"The latest allegations about lockdown-era gatherings at Downing Street have provoked a furious backlash on the front pages of Tuesday’s papers. The normally pro-Boris Johnson Express blasts a full-throated warning in its splash headline: “Enough Boris! You MUST end ‘partygate’ farce now”, it says, reflecting backbench Tory exasperation at the drip-drip of damaging reports about partying No 10 staffers.  Tomorrow's front page: Enough Boris! You must end 'partygate' farce now#TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/PMteBo6k6f The Mail takes a similar line and says “Boris rocked by new party revelations”, ramming home the iniquity being felt by people throughout Britain with a subhead that reads: “Email proves key aide invited 100 Downing Street staff to party with PM – while public could only meet one person outdoors”. Tuesday’s @DailyMailUK #MailFrontPages pic.twitter.com/NsD2dPPhLp Others are more scathing with the i picking up on a particularly galling line from the leaked email invitation to the gathering on 20 May. “‘Bring your own booze’”.

The Times does have the story on its front page – “No10 celebrated ‘lovely weather’ with lockdown drinks party” – but leads on limits to sporting fixtures being eased. TIMES: Pressure mounts for five days of isolation #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/c6izcr2pcP Ditto the Telegraph, which says “Johnson received invite to lockdown party” but leads on cabinet anger over misleading isolation guidance. 📰The front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph:'Cabinet anger over misleading isolation guidance'#TomorrowsPapersTodaySign up for the Front Page newsletterhttps://t.co/x8AV4Oomry pic.twitter.com/2Tbnbm4M4x",News/Media,‘Bring your own booze’: newspapers lash PM over latest Downing Street party claim,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/11/bring-your-own-booze-newspapers-lash-pm-over-latest-downing-street-party-claim
