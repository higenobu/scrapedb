4/19/2022,"Compared with the famous événements of May 1968, the flurry of leftwing student demonstrations that took place in Paris last week was small in scale. But the protesters’ message – echoed in other university towns – was enough to make the national media sit up and take notice. One student summed up the mood by telling Le Monde he saw little difference between a vote for Marine Le Pen or Emmanuel Macron at the forthcoming presidential runoff ballot. “Young people are being given a false choice between two options that are equally bad,” said Baptiste, 22. “There’s a growing rebellion and rejection of this.” It is the vital task of a newly galvanised Mr Macron to ensure that this is a minority view come Sunday, when the second round takes place. With some success, he has begun to address the priorities of youthful voters who originally supported Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s radical left platform. In a rally at the weekend, he pledged a new focus on environmental targets to make France “the first leading nation to end oil, gas and coal consumption”. Belatedly, the election spotlight is also turning on to the aggressive xenophobia running through Ms Le Pen’s programme, as her policy on banning headscarves in public spaces comes under critical scrutiny. Latest polls suggest that Mr Macron’s lead is lengthening, although the race is still too close for comfort. But beyond the current election, crucial as it is, the Paris student protests are a sign of a growing dissatisfaction with mainstream options among the young. That Mr Macron topped the polls in the first round was largely thanks to the votes of the over-60s. A clear majority of voters under the age of 35 chose Mr Mélenchon. More alarmingly, Ms Le Pen came second. The taboo on voting for the Europhobic far right is fading among those too young to be influenced by the collective memory of two world wars and the crimes of the Vichy regime. The collapse of the centre-left and centre-right, and a disturbingly high abstention rate in the same age range (more than 40%), adds to the impression of a deep disillusionment with politics-as-usual that needs to be addressed. One route to renewal would be to reform a system that stakes too much on a two-round, all-or-nothing presidential election every five years. The constitutional weakness of parliament, and the lack of proportional representation, has overly concentrated power in the Élysée (a problem that Mr Macron’s sometimes autocratic style has made worse). More broadly though, political polarisation among the young reflects frustrations that are at work in other post-industrial western democracies, including Britain. Issues such as precarious and unfulfilling work, low pay and asset-based inequality have created a slow-burn generational crisis. According to a 2020 study by the University of Cambridge’s Centre for the Future of Democracy, millennial political dissatisfaction outstrips that of preceding generations. In the interests of France and other liberal democracies, it is imperative that Mr Macron successfully mobilises the support of enough young people on Sunday to see off Ms Le Pen. After that, a more profound and lasting political reset may be required.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on chasing the French youth vote: millennial discontents won’t go away | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/18/the-guardian-view-on-chasing-the-french-youth-vote-millennial-discontents-wont-go-away
4/19/2022,"A Kentucky man was awarded $450,000 in a lawsuit against his former employer, after the company disregarded his wish not to be given a birthday party. In August 2019, Gravity Diagnostics, a medical laboratory, ignored Kevin Berling’s request not to celebrate his birthday due to his anxiety disorder. According to Tony Bucher, Berling’s attorney, Berling spoke to the birthday celebration organizer about his request not to have a party, but “the person who was responsible for the birthday parties who he talked to flat-out forgot about his request”. As a result, the company hosted the celebration, at which Berling suffered a panic attack. According to Bucher, Berling went to his car, practiced breathing techniques, ate his lunch and then texted his manager, upset his request had been ignored. The person who scheduled the party, Berling said, “didn’t do it to be mean. She said she would accommodate [Berling’s request] and she just forgot.” The next day, according to Berling’s lawsuit, Berling was “confronted and criticized” for his reaction. “According to my client, [his managers] started reading him the riot act and accused him of stealing other co-workers’ joy,” Bucher told Link NKY. According to the lawsuit, “this confrontation triggered another panic attack”. Amid this attack, Bucher said, co-workers asked Berling to stop using coping mechanisms including “hugging himself”. When he did not, the staff members walked out. Bucher said: “The way [they] say it, they believed he was enraged and possibly about to get violent.” Berling’s lawsuit said: “At the conclusion of this meeting and because plaintiff had a panic attack, plaintiff was sent home from work for the remainder of 8 and 9 August.” Berling apologized for having a panic attack. But, his lawsuit said, three days later he received an email from the company, “informing him that he was being terminated because of the events of the previous week”. According to court documents, a jury awarded Berling $450,000, including “$120,000 in lost wages and benefits; $30,000 in future lost wages and benefits; and $300,000 for past, present and future mental pain and suffering, mental anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, mortification and loss of self-esteem”. In a statement, Kenton circuit court judge Patricia Summe said Berling “was able to perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodations” but “suffered an adverse employment action because of that disability”. Julie Brazil, chief operating officer of Gravity Diagnostics, said the verdict set a dangerous precedent for employers and employees that unless physical violence happens, any other form of workplace violence is permissible. “As an employer who puts our employee safety first, we have a zero-tolerance policy and we stand by our decision to terminate the plaintiff for his violation of our workplace violence policy,” Brazil told Link NKY. “My employees were the victims in this case, not the plaintiff.” Brazil indicated that the company would appeal.",News/US news,"US man gets $450,000 after unwanted work birthday party triggered panic attack",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/18/unwanted-office-birthday-party-lawsuit-panic-attack
4/19/2022,"India has been accused of attempting to delay an effort by the World Health Organization to revise the global death toll from Covid-19 after its calculations suggested that the country had undercounted its dead by an estimated 3.5 million. India’s official number of deaths from Covid is 520,000. But according to in-depth analysis and investigations into the data by WHO, the total is more than 4 million, which would be by far the highest country death toll in the world. The figure tallies with previous estimates made by scientists, data analysts and medical journals that the true number of deaths from Covid in India was up to 10 times higher than that recorded in official statistics. After the country was engulfed in a devastating second wave in April 2021, central and state governments were accused of covering up the real numbers of those died from the virus in order to deflect accusations that not enough was done to prevent its spread or provide adequate healthcare, medicine and oxygen. According to reports, the WHO had wanted to release the data in January but have received considerable pushback from the Indian government, which have refused to accept the figure and methodology as correct. The WHO has stated it now intend to publish this month the revised data, which estimates 15 million people have died from Covid, more than double the 6 million known deaths. The updated figure, which is drawn from excess death data among other figures, also includes those who died from other illnesses but could not be treated because of Covid. Addressing a New York Times report in which the accusation was made, the Indian government said it was in discussion with the WHO. “India’s basic objection has not been with the result (whatever they might have been) but rather the methodology adopted for the same,” it said in an statement, which alleged the mathematical modelling was “questionable” and “statistically unproven”. However, Jon Wakefield, a professor of statistics and biostatistics at the University of Washington who was one of those involved in the modelling for the WHO, released a statement that explained the methodology in detail and rebutted the claims made by the Indian government about the veracity of the modelling. There are fears India may be facing another imminent wave of coronavirus after daily cases jumped by 90% this week and the rate of positive test results rose from 0.3% to 0.8% overnight, with much of the surge in Delhi.",News/World news,Covid-19: India accused of trying to delay WHO revision of death toll,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/covid-19-india-accused-of-attempting-to-delay-who-revision-of-death-toll
4/19/2022,"The second half of Super League’s gruelling Easter double-header is rarely short on narrative. With clubs playing three times in little more than a week there is the potential for seasons to be defined, one way or another. That certainly felt the case as Castleford and Leeds played out a contest riddled with tension. On the day when Jack Sinfield, son of legendary Rhinos and England captain Kevin, made his professional debut at the age of 17, the long-held belief at Headingley that he can help be part of a new dynasty of success at Super League’s most successful club will have to wait for now. There are more pressing matters for Leeds to deal with, such as the fact that with more than a third of the regular season gone, they are in the thick of a relegation battle. There are positives. Amid a huge injury crisis, a number of encouraging performances from youngsters means the future is bright. And Leeds are improving. The interim coach, Jamie Jones-Buchanan, said: “We’re a million miles away from where we were a month ago,” and he is right in terms of the Rhinos’ effort and endeavour – but they need to start winning games. There level of anticipation on Sinfield’s shoulders was raised due to his surname but the reality is that a 17-year-old half-back was never likely to have a discernible impact on a team with just one win from 10 matches in all competitions this season. Richard Agar’s successor, who will be named next week, has a big job on his hands. There was no doubting Leeds performed with spirit but they fell short once again, with Liam Watts’s try in the final minutes proving decisive. With Hull Kingston Rovers prevailing against Toulouse on Monday it means Leeds remain one point clear of the bottom-placed club but still two wins adrift of the two teams above them, Wakefield and Salford, who lost against Wigan and Catalans respectively. “It was a typical Bank Holiday Monday game, they’re in a bad spot and we exposed that,” Castleford’s coach, Lee Radford, said. James Clare and Derrell Olpherts scored tries to put the hosts 8-0 ahead but on the stroke of half-time Rhyse Martin seized on an error to narrow the gap to two at the break. Errors from both sides in the second half kept it tight and tense. Gareth O’Brien and Martin exchanged penalties on the hour mark to make it 10-8 in Castleford’s favour before a big moment. James Bentley was sin-binned and three minutes later, Watts broke free to touch down. Martin’s second try set up a nervous final few minutes for Castleford but the final outcome was a familiar one for those who have followed the travails of the Rhinos in 2022.",Sport/Sport,Jack Sinfield unable to provide a spark as Leeds are sunk by Castleford,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/castleford-tigers-leeds-rhinos-super-league-match-report
4/19/2022,"Councils in England are paying more than £1m a year for a single place in privately run children’s homes, with operators citing the cost of living crisis as a reason for raising their prices, the Guardian has learned. Private providers have been accused of making “obscene” profits out of some of society’s most vulnerable children, as local authorities reveal they are being quoted as much as £50,000 a week (£2.6m a year) for one child. Children with complex needs – such as having received death threats, behavioural problems, autism spectrum disorders or being a danger to themselves or others – may require supervision from staff with specialist training, or numerous carers. A local authority in the north-east told the Guardian it had “very reluctantly” paid £18,500 a week (£962,000 a year) for one child, while Liverpool council revealed it was paying £780,000 a year for a child who needs three carers. A report from Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole children’s services department, which last week was issued with a statutory notice to improve, said placements for the most vulnerable children had reached £1.2m a year for one child “who may perhaps need a 4:1 staff ratio (4 carers to 1 child)”. The Ministry of Justice says it costs £270,000 a year to keep a child in youth custody in a secure, state-run children’s home. These house children who have been sentenced for the most serious crimes, including murder. A council in the West Midlands told the Association of Directors of Children’s Services (ADCS) it was quoted £25,000-£50,000 a week for a secure “wing” for one child with a deprivation of liberty order. The child was deemed a risk to others and was the subject of an Osman warning, meaning police believe there is a credible threat to their life, plus a secure order and a care order. Profit margins for the 15 largest private children’s home operators average 22.6%, according to the Competition and Markets Authority. Average prices are £4,865 a week for a local authority place and £4,153 for a private placement, a review by the Personal Social Services Review Unit found. This is up from about £3,000 in 2016 and prices are rising week by week, councils say, as providers cite the cost of food, petrol and energy. The most expensive placements are with private providers, who say high costs are dictated by the extreme needs of the children. Mark Kerr, the deputy chief executive of the Independent Children’s Home Association (ICHA), said: “Such high-level needs and risks require significant specialised care 24 hours a day to ensure they are kept safe and their needs are met. It is important to note such levels of need are often a result of previously failing to invest in the right provision at the right time.” The Guardian contacted more than 100 local authorities in England to ask the cost of their most expensive children’s home placement. Of those that replied, many said they had at least one child whose care cost £10,000 a week or more, with providers increasing their prices further in recent weeks and blaming the cost of living crisis. Medway in Kent said it had 12 children in placements costing more than £10,000 a week in the last five years. It spent £13,700 a week for nine months on several different private placements for a young person who needed three-to-one support, with staff working nights. All staff needed to be restraint-trained and the young person was subject to a deprivation of liberty order. Halton in Merseyside said it had paid £12,115 a week for a crisis placement, required at short notice, for a 13-year-old girl with special needs after a “fire setting incident”. Children who have a history of arson are particularly difficult to place, with providers reticent to accept such a difficult request from local authorities. “You have providers looking at pen portraits of 30 children and deciding who’s the easiest, who’s going to cause the least disruption to the home, who’s got the least care history, no history of arson or challenging behaviour … The providers are looking for the easiest young person to take into their home for the maximum profit,” said Julie Jenkins, the director of children’s services at Calderdale in West Yorkshire. Steve Reddy, the director of children’s services in Liverpool, said the council was spending £15,000 a week (£780,000 a year) for a place for a child who needed to be supervised by three carers. The child has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and self-harms, resulting in repeat hospitalisations. Reddy said that he had recently turned down a bid from one operator who quoted £30,000 a week. “Some of the profits being made are frankly obscene,” he said. Steve Crocker, the president of the ADCS, said: “Meeting children’s needs, not maximising profits should always be the priority. A comprehensive national placement strategy is needed to ensure the right homes are available in the right places. “ADCS has previously called for the introduction of legislation which prevents for-profit operations, or as a minimum caps the level of fees chargeable, in fostering and residential services. Whilst this will take time to achieve, ADCS is committed to the aspiration of moving to a not-for-profit model.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “All children and young people deserve to grow up in stable, loving homes, and no private company should exploit those in need of placement. “We commissioned an independent review of children’s social care, which will set out to radically reform the system, and are working hard to raise standards for children in care while it continues.”",News/Society,English councils pay £1m per child for places in private children’s homes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/18/english-councils-pay-1m-per-child-for-places-in-private-childrens-homes
4/19/2022,"Council bosses in England are sometimes having to pay seven-figure sums annually in order to house a child with complex needs. Many local authorities currently have at least one child whose care costs £10,000 a week or more, with providers increasing their prices further in recent weeks and blaming the cost of living crisis. Here, a care home manager* explains how care can cost £1m a year: “When we meet with local authorities, they ask us to give a breakdown of costs. When they realise how we have to cost our services, they start to understand. The high costs are almost always for placements that are made in an emergency after a child has gone through 10+ other placements which have been bought on the cheap and haven’t been able to meet their needs. The biggest scandal is that local authorities always try and use the cheapest placement first. When children’s needs aren’t met, that’s what ends up costing the taxpayer a fortune. “How can it cost £22,000 [a week] to look after one child? Let me explain. Imagine you own an empty three-bedded children’s home. It has a manager on £50k and three staff on £27k. The company also has a responsible individual (legal requirement), administrator, HR, finance, QA [quality assurance], referrals. Salaries attributed to the home are around £100k (est £2,000 a week). “Now imagine that you are asked to accommodate a 13-year-old child. They must have three staff with them at all times. This means you have to employ six extra staff. There can be no other children in the home. The child needs to move in three days. The authority are desperate. You want to help. But the only way you can do so is by using agency staff (you don’t have six spare staff standing by). Two agency staff for a 24-hour shift at £40 an hour is going to cost £1,920 a day (that’s £13,500 a week). You’ll charge the LA [local authority] at cost and make no profit on this. There’s also property costs, vehicle, insurance, training, maintenance, equipment, adaptations, resources, food & activities for child and staff. There’s regulation, monitoring. You also have to factor in risks of unknown costs. For all that you add another £2,000 a week. “Now let’s say that the council say they only want the child to stay for 28 days (this is pretty common). You don’t take the risk of recruiting staff with no guarantee of the arrangement continuing. This means you have to factor in the continued use of agency. On top of all this you have to operate your business with an estimation that for some parts of the year the home will be empty (there is never any guarantee of business) so you have to include a payment for vacancies. And while dealing with all this you are acutely aware that you are responsible for a high risk service. If anything goes wrong, despite your best efforts, your entire business could be closed down in a heartbeat. You will need to pay off debts and manage the risks and future. “There will be a very small number of providers who may take the mickey but hardly any, as most of us are in this for the long haul and know the value of positive relationships with local authorities.” * This contributor remains anonymous at their request.",News/Society,‘How can it cost £20k a week to look after one child?’: a care home manager explains,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/18/how-can-it-cost-20k-a-week-to-look-after-one-child-a-care-home-manager-explains
4/19/2022,"Jill Knight, the long-serving Conservative backbench MP for the south Birmingham constituency of Edgbaston, who has died aged 98, was not as benign or inoffensive as she sometimes appeared. Known for her colourful floral dress sense – once memorably described by the former Times parliamentary sketch writer Craig Brown as making her look like a fist fight in a hydrangea bush – Knight devoted much of her career to campaigning against immigration and easier divorce, was in favour of the return of the death penalty and, most notably, clause 28 banning the alleged promotion of homosexuality by local authorities in their schools. The clause arose out of a spurious moral panic that was stirred up on the Tory backbenches in the mid-1980s and assiduously promoted by some tabloids that teaching unions and some Labour local authorities were somehow encouraging children to become gay. There was virtually no evidence for this apart from some nebulous and notably prim sex education books seeking to reduce anti-gay prejudice. As the Daily Mail’s education correspondent at the time I was charged with finding such subversive literature in schools, but never did. The only copy of the most notorious booklet – Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin – that I ever saw was the one in the bottom drawer of my desk at work. Nevertheless it was an early culture wars issue and the fear among some Tories such as Knight that children could be “made gay” was exploited by rightwing and some evangelical pressure groups. The clause took two years to reach the statute book, interrupted by the 1987 general election, a process whose unintended consequence was to unite most of the gay population and many others in outright and reasoned opposition, including stunts such as lesbian activists abseiling into the Commons chamber and others invading the BBC’s Six O’Clock News studio during a broadcast. Knight – in 1985 she became Dame Jill Knight – introduced the original clause in the Commons which eventually became part of the Local Government Act of 1988, claiming to have been besieged by concerned parents and complaining of having been hectored by the Gay Liberation Front. When she voted against equal rights to marriage in 2013, she insisted unconvincingly that she was not homophobic as some gay people were “very good at antiques” – antique hunting was one of her own recreations. The clause was eventually repealed in 2003, without a single prosecution, leading eventually to an apology from David Cameron in 2009 and, in an interview nine years later, Knight’s regret that she was “sorry if the law hurt anyone”. Private member’s measures that she got passed concerned childproof packaging, genetic engineering, design copyright and nationality rights for children born abroad with British mothers. Born in Bristol, she was the daughter of an accountant, Arthur Meek, and his, wife Alma, a teacher. Though given the name Joan, as a twin to her brother Jack she was always known as Jill. Following her parents’ acrimonious divorce – a life-changing experience affecting her future views on stable family life, as she never saw her father again – the family moved to Birmingham, where she attended King Edward VI grammar school in Handsworth. Knight claimed that it was a socialist teacher who turned her into a young Conservative after she was marked down for an essay on William Morris’s News from Nowhere. During the second world war she served with the Women’s Royal Air Force (Wraf), where she met and in 1947 married Monty Knight, an optician, who shared her robust rightwing views. In 1956 Knight became a Tory councillor in Northampton, where the family lived, and fought the fox-hunting Old Etonian Labour MP Reginald Paget (later Lord Paget of Northampton) unsuccessfully at the general elections of 1959 and 1964. She encountered distinct misogyny from local associations when applying for selection as a candidate in winnable seats, but was eventually chosen – from more than 200 male candidates – following the sudden death of Dame Edith Pitt, the MP for Edgbaston, the leafy Birmingham suburban constituency, shortly before the 1966 general election. She held the seat until retirement in 1997, when the constituents chose another woman, this time Labour’s Gisela Stuart, to succeed her. The seat, once Neville Chamberlain’s, is the only one in the country to have chosen four successive female MPs, the current incumbent being Labour’s Preet Gill. In parliament – initially one of only 26 women MPs, seven of them Conservative – Knight was reliably reactionary on social issues. She consistently opposed the legalisation of abortion – “Babies are not like bad teeth to be jerked out,” she said during the passage of David Steel’s abortion bill in 1967 – and also the provision of the contraceptive pill to teenagers. She opposed sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa and was a member of the rightwing Monday Club during its 70s heyday. It was in a speech at her constituency association’s dinner in 1974 that Sir Keith Joseph effectively scuppered his chances of ever leading the party by arguing that the balance of Britain’s “human stock” was threatened because poorer people had too many children. She became a firm supporter of Margaret Thatcher, claiming to detect communists in senior positions in the Labour party: “If Nazi Germany had had as many supporters at Westminster at the time of Munich as communism has today, we would have lost the war.” Never likely to become a minister, she was a member of the executive of the backbench Tory 1922 committee, including terms as secretary and vice-chair, for 18 years, and served on the home affairs, race relations and immigration select committees and on the all-party child and family protection group. Her only rebellion came when the Thatcher government imposed charges for eye-tests and dental appointments, bearing in mind her husband’s profession. Following her retirement from the Commons in 1997, she was given a life peerage, becoming the first woman to serve in parliament continuously for more than 50 years, standing down finally only in 2016. Monty died in 1986. The couple had two sons, of whom one survives her.

4/19/2022,"A charity that supports actors who are experiencing hardship due to old age, injury or illness is under investigation over concerns about its governance. A dispute at the Actors’ Benevolent Fund had pit a group of longstanding trustees – including the actor Dame Penelope Keith, who has been its president for the past 32 years – against its general secretary, who was appointed in 2016. The Charity Commission said it had an “ongoing case” into the fund, which was set up in 1882 and whose patron is the Prince of Wales. The commission said it was “assessing concerns reported to us about the charity’s governance” but declined to provide details. Ten people, including Keith, were removed from the charity’s council of trustees in February in what they claim was a procedural manoeuvre. As well as Keith, who played Margo Leadbetter in the 1970s suburban sitcom The Good Life, the ousted council members included Dame Siân Phillips, James Bolam and Brian Murphy. According to reports, the longtime trustees had earlier questioned Jonathan Ellicott, the fund’s general secretary, over financial issues. He lodged an official complaint of bullying and harassment. He eventually left his post at the end of March on unspecified terms. There was no response on Monday to a request for comment from the charity. The fund provides financial support to actors and stage managers who are experiencing hardship due to injury, illness or old age, distributing about £1m a year. It offers weekly help with household expenses, one-off payments for larger items such as disability aids, and benefits advice. Founded by Henry Irving, its past presidents include John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier. Keith said the fund’s problems had been exacerbated by meetings being held remotely during the past two years, instead of monthly in-person gatherings. “The dreaded Zoom was a great problem. I loathed it,” she told the Times. “With Zoom meetings, the people who talk and talk and talk will talk and talk and talk. The people you really want to hear won’t have their say … That was the time the divisions started in the council. It just got worse and worse. I put a lot of this down to Zoom.” She said she had written to Prince Charles to let him know “there was a bit of trouble at mill”.",News/Society,Charity Commission investigates actors’ fund over governance ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/18/charity-commission-investigates-governance-actors-benevolent-fund-penelope-keith
4/19/2022,"‘When you or I look out a window we’ll see more or less the same things”, a leading British composer once said to me, “But if Harry looked out of it, he would see something entirely different.” The utter distinctiveness of Harrison Birtwistle’s music came from his utterly distinctive view of the world. He was a very singular creative figure, one of the greatest in the history of British music, I would maintain, but he and his music were never predictable or easy to pin down. I knew him for more than 40 years and never ceased to be surprised by what captured his imagination, whether it was the intricate 18th century Dutch still life in a US gallery that interested him more than any of the great 20th century paintings on show, or discussing the French fondness for eating ortolans, and the now illegal techniques employed for trapping these tiny songbirds. For a composer whose music was rooted firmly in early 20th century modernism, in Stravinsky, Webern and Varèse, and whose work was often held up by reactionaries as an example of all that was unapproachable and difficult about contemporary music, Birtwistle’s personal tastes could be surprisingly Catholic. When he was a guest on BBC Radio 3’s Private Passions his choices included a song by Roy Orbison, and he once confessed to me his love of the music of George Butterworth, especially the Shropshire Lad Rhapsody, and how much he admired Gustav Holst’s Egdon Heath. In a profound way he was very much part of the English pastoral tradition, though the landscapes his music explored may be very different and often far more disquieting than those of Butterworth or Vaughan Williams. Birtwistle’s was a musical world in which ritual always played an important part too, and it’s surely no coincidence that having previously lived in the Hebrides and southern France, as well as London, he eventually settled in Wiltshire, close to the most famous of all British ritual landscapes – Stonehenge. Though he found it almost impossible to explain exactly how he composed, and how he used the tables of random numbers that played such an important yet mysterious part in his music, Birtwistle maintained that he felt he was constantly writing the same piece, that each of his works took a different path through the same mass of musical material. Despite the apparent complexity of his scores, their labyrinths of interconnected tempos and the multilayered textures of his orchestral music, he always insisted that they were just built from the most basic musical ingredients of pitch and pulse. In a creative career that lasted more than 50 years, he explored virtually every musical genre, but its core was unquestionably his music-theatre works. As a child he had built theatrical sets, imagining the dramas that took place within them; it was an idea that he revived in 2004 for his music-theatre piece The Io Passion. The concept of a hidden scenario, “secret theatre”, as one of his finest ensemble pieces is called, was behind much of his output, not just the large-scale operas from Punch and Judy to The Minotaur, but also the works that defy easy categorisation, such as the extraordinary improvised Bow Down (1977), or the “mechanical pastoral” Yan Tan Tethera (1986), both to texts by the poet Tony Harrison, and the finest of all his collaborations from his years at the Royal National Theatre, his devastatingly spare score for Peter Hall’s 1983 production of The Oresteia. Among his six full-length operas, only one, The Last Supper, premiered in Berlin in 2000, which is hobbled by its sententious libretto, seems unlikely to endure. But with the exception of Punch and Judy, productions of the others have been disappointingly few, though at least in 2019 Birtwistle was able to see The Mask of Orpheus, perhaps his greatest single achievement, on stage again, despite the shortcomings of the production. And though his music still presents many challenges to orchestras and ensembles, the brilliance of scores such as The Triumph of Time, ...agm …, Silbury Air, The Shadow of Night and Deep Time, should ensure their place in the repertory. In public he had a reputation for gruffness, and though he mellowed considerably over the years, he could still be blunt to the point of rudeness if provoked. “You don’t like my music. Go away!” he once commanded a fellow music-critic who appeared when he and I were chatting before a concert. Yet in private he was quietly spoken, witty and a wonderful host. Those are qualities that perhaps appear less often in his music than they might have done, but the humour that surfaces in sections of his opera The Second Mrs Kong, and the delicate beauty and intensity of his choral Moth Requiem are certainly true to character.",Arts/Music,Andrew Clements on Harrison Birtwistle: An utterly distinctive composer who wrote music of delicate beauty | Andrew Clements,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/18/harrison-birtwistle-utterly-distinctive-music-of-delicate-beauty-andrew-clements
4/19/2022,"All UK taxpayers will from now on be complicit in legalised human trafficking, following the unveiling of the government plan to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda (UK Rwanda plan for asylum seekers decried as inhumane, expensive and deadly, 14 April). Rwanda has a dubious human rights record. The UK is handing over the safety and human rights of possible refugees, allegedly persecuted in their own countries, to Rwanda, a country that in 2010 was among the 10 lowest-ranked countries in the world for press freedom.Tirthankar BandyopadhyayHounslow, London  History seems to be in danger of repeating itself. In the first half of the 19th century, the Royal Navy was dispatched to west Africa to intercept the shipment of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Many of the naval initiatives were considered illegal at the time. Those “liberated” by naval action were then sent around the Atlantic world. They were given no choice as to where they would be “resettled”. Under the policy, perhaps 100,000 Africans were “rescued” from transatlantic slavery, but a further 3.5 million were still shipped to the Americas between 1807 and 1867, a million of them illegally. One suspects that the UK government’s politically motivated scheme will fare no better in inhibiting the activities of 21st-century people traffickers.Prof David RichardsonWilberforce Institute, University of Hull  As a historian, I was reminded of the suggestions by several 1930s British fascist organisations that Jews should be exiled to Madagascar. Tory leaders’ contempt towards parliament also recalls the interwar fascist view of parliamentary democracy as an effete anachronism that could be undermined and superseded. While the Conservative party is not a fascist party, it is undoubtedly halfway down the road to fascism.Dr Martin PughSlaley, Northumberland  Having worked in Rwanda, I believe the Home Office plan will be ineffective and poor value for money. Many of the people crossing the Channel originate from Iran, Iraq and Syria. Culturally, they are unlikely to integrate into Rwandan society, which is of a predominantly Christian tradition and has different cultural values. In view of Israel’s abortive attempt at a similar plan for the resettlement of its African migrants and the closure of the Australia’s offshore processing in Papua New Guinea, it would be folly to proceed.Dr Joseph MullenFormer UN adviser to Rwanda  The minister for Brexit opportunities once again excels in ambiguity (Rwanda asylum plan is ‘almost Easter story of redemption’, says Rees-Mogg, 17 April). Yes, the plan to send refugees to Rwanda is reminiscent of some aspects of the Easter story. Possibly the part where an innocent man is arrested, detained, tortured and killed, to satisfy an angry nationalist mob. And the part where due legal process is abandoned to help an incompetent, amoral administrator out of his personal political mire. Yes, so much like Easter.Neil RossNewark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire  The government claims that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda is a challenge to the people traffickers’ business model. What next?

4/19/2022,"Your editorial (14 April) supports the Archbishop of Canterbury in calling for the removal of monuments such as that to Tobias Rustat, whose wealth derived from slavery. But the Church of England was part of the establishment in the 18th and early 19th century, and for the most part strongly defensive of slavery – as were William Gladstone (later prime minister) and John Newman (later cardinal). The first paragraph of six pages on Anglicanism and slavery in Michael Taylor’s The Interest: How the British Establishment Resisted the Abolition of Slavery, led me to Bishop Richard Watson of Llandaff, who defended the slave trade. Watson is buried in St Martin’s Church in Bowness-on-Windermere, where the vestry has a memorial to him by John Flaxman. In the south aisle of the church is a marble slab commemorating John Bolton, a slave trader and plantation owner who died in 1837 – after abolition. Admittedly, the churchyard has a headstone dated 1822 inscribed to the memory of a freed slave named Rasselas Belfield, thought to have been in service locally. If I can find all this in five minutes, it suggests that the archbishop is opening the way to wholesale vandalism of the country’s churches. Much better, surely, to commission marble plaques to be prominently positioned in every “guilty” church admitting its culpa, maxima culpa in past days and expressing its deep repentance now.David PollockStoke Newington, London  There is an elephant in this religious room. Your editorial says that the average Anglican these days is a 30-year-old black woman. What goes unremarked in current debate about slavery and empire is that the predominant cultural imposition that European powers made was Christianity. The destruction of cultures and religions across Africa (and elsewhere) by Christian missionaries, aided and abetted by the invading authorities, is reflected today in that religion’s widespread persistence among those with African heritage. Set against that vast cultural imposition, a few plaques and statues in the UK are almost trivial. It is the consequences of slavery that should be examined, not just the historical trinkets.Dr David MillerLymington, Hampshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
