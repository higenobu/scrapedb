1/27/2022,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Danilo Masoni LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities are due a rebound after Wednesday's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, several indicators based on market levels and positioning are signalling. Share markets have taken a beating as investors have ramped up bets that an era of ultra-low interest rates and vast pools of liquidity that boosted risk assets is fading quickly. The Fed is expected to signal later in the day that it will embark on policy tightening with rate hikes and balance sheet cutbacks. Global stocks have lost 7% so far in 2022, with the Nasdaq Composite set for its worst start to the year since 1980 as high-flying technology shares fall out of favour. But many reckon markets may have found a temporary bottom. Goldman Sachs told clients the falls did not indicate a ""danger zone"" had been reached and that its risk indicator models suggest markets are nearing levels that are considered good entry points for longer-term investors. Citibank too advised investors to consider buying into market dips. Based on a series of 18 metrics it said the number of ""red flags"" on U.S. markets was far lower than before the 2008 crisis and the bursting of the dotcom bubble. Below are some more indicators signalling conditions for a bounce: 1/OVERSOLD TERRITORY Chartists have been watching the relative strength index (RSI) to gauge oversold conditions for U.S. indices after this month's ructions. A level below 30 is traditionally seen as indicating a selloff has gone too far and pointing to a short-term bounce. All three major U.S. benchmarks are trading below that level, and the Nasdaq 100 - which has shed $3 trillion in market value this year - fell all the way to the lowest since December 2018 at 25.4. ""U.S. markets are now looking oversold. I sense a rally,"" one UK-based trader said.

While the S&P has switched from net long to net short, Nasdaq positioning remains net short and according to Citi, the most ""negatively extended"". Recent selling was more sentiment-driven than linked to new macro data, the bank said, adding that Nasdaq futures positioning was a ""one-sided short with profit levels rapidly rising which could lead to a short-term rebound."" Overall, the futures flows picture implied ""weak conviction,"" they added. (Reprinted with permission of Citi Research. Not to be reproduced.)

The CBOE put-to-call ratio has hit its highest since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, signalling investors may be getting too pessimistic in the short term. Put options confer the right to sell at a pre-agreed price and calls allow holders to buy. putcall https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwxmkdpo/putcall.JPG (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee in London and Danilo Masoni in Milan; Editing by John Stonestreet)",Business/Reuters,Market signals scream buy after world stocks tumble,https://news.yahoo.com/market-signals-scream-buy-world-133429566.html
1/27/2022,"Sen. Ron Johnson said it's not ""society's responsibility"" to ""take care of other people's children."" Instead, Johnson backed slashing unemployment benefits to alleviate the ongoing labor shortage. He previously said he was ""not a real fan"" of the child tax credit. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson argued against government efforts to make child care cheaper for parents during a visit on Tuesday to Kwik Trip's headquarters in La Crosse. ""People decide to have families and become parents. That's something they need to consider when they make that choice,"" Johnson told local Wisconsin TV station WKBT. ""I've never really felt it was society's responsibility to take care of other people's children."" Speaking to WKBT, Johnson said that he did not support moves by the government to help families find child care options. Instead, Johnson told the news station that he would support slashing unemployment benefits to get more people back to work and alleviate the ongoing labor shortage. He told WKBT that he would back more efforts to help people get jobs that would allow them to support their own families. Johnson has historically not been a supporter of childcare-related legislation. In May 2021, Johnson remarked on WKOW-TV that he supported slashing Wisconsin's $300 per week federal unemployment subsidy. During the interview, Johnson pushed back on a suggestion from WKOW-TV host A. J. Bayatpour that many women cannot re-enter the workforce because their wages do not cover the cost of childcare. ""Unemployment benefits are not meant to provide replacement wages. That was provided during COVID when it was nobody's fault that they were losing their job or they were being encouraged to stay home so they wouldn't spread the disease,"" Johnson said. ""Wages are set in the marketplace. Businesses pay what wages they can afford based on the competitive situation, whether it's in a restaurant, whether it's in manufacturing, where they're competing against foreign manufacturers versus domestic suppliers,"" Johnson added. ""I just have greater faith in the marketplace setting appropriate wage rates."" Johnson also admitted he was ""not a real fan"" of the child tax credit which offers parents up to $3,600 per child. ""In general, I don't like to use the tax code for either economic or social engineering. I think we do a terrible job. I prefer a tax code that was simple, that was rational, that treated all income equally,"" Johnson said in response to a question about the child tax credit. President Joe Biden conceded in January that he was ""not sure"" that he would be able to keep monthly checks to parents going due to resistance from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to the Build Back Better plan. Build Back Better is now stalled while Democratic lawmakers try to negotiate with Manchin, one of the lone holdouts against the plan, whose support is essential for them to get the bill over the finish line in the 50-50 Senate.
