2/7/2022,"The principal of a private Sydney school has defended its “statement of faith” that lists same-sex relationships and transgender identity alongside abusive relationships as “not acceptable to God”, saying critics had taken it out of context. The Penrith Christian school attached its statement of faith to enrolment application forms for students, asking parents to indicate they had “read and understood” it.  In a letter to parents on Monday following media reports, school principal Tracey Deal stood by the statement of faith, saying it had been taken out of context. “It is disappointing that the media have misunderstood and misinterpreted a small part of the Statement of Faith and inferred mistreatment of students” the letter read. The statement of faith, which is attached to the school’s enrolment application, must be “read and understood” as part of any prospective application, and gives parents an option to discuss the matter with the school. The school says the document “covers our present needs as to these fundamental doctrines,” before detailing its understanding of “fallen relationships”. “Adultery, same sex attraction, transgender identity, premarital sex, sexual acts between members of the same sex and abusive relationships, are all examples of relationships and behaviours which are not acceptable to God.” “Sexual relationships should be exercised exclusively in a marital relationship between a male and female.” There is no indication what, if any, are the consequences for breaching the statement of faith. In the letter sent to parents, Deal stressed the document makes it clear it relates to “those who have been regenerated, justified and adopted into the family of God.” “This clearly indicates that what follows is intended to outline the expectations of mature believers,” the letter reads. “We ask parents to indicate that they have read and understand our statement, to ensure that you know our beliefs. We also invite you to contact us if there are any issues you want to discuss. This offer remains as an open invitation.” Deal declined to answer the Guardian’s questions, instead reiterating that the document had been taken “out of context”. “At present the school is focussing on supporting our students and school community following the recent media coverage that misrepresented our school and inferred conduct that simply does not occur,” she said. “As we have done since the school commenced, we will continue to focus ensuring that the school is a place where all students are genuinely loved and nurtured, a safe and secure environment.” It comes after the principal of Citipointe Christian College in Brisbane stepped down for a period of ‘extended leave’ after criticism for issuing student enrolment contracts that included gender and sexuality clauses. The contract was later withdrawn, with the principal insisting that “the college does not and will not discriminate against any student because of their sexuality or gender identity”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Thursday that the government would work to amend the religious freedom bill to explicitly prevent students being expelled for their sexuality or gender. The contentious religious discrimination bill proposed by the Morrison government would also make schools with controversial “statements of faith” immune to any legal consequences. President of the Rationalist Society of Australia, Dr Meredith Doig, told the Guardian it was “appalling” that schools could discriminate based on sexuality and gender. “Schools like Penrith and Citipointe are just the tip of the iceberg. Their ‘biblically-based’ anti-LGBTI views will become much more commonly seen if the religious discrimination bill is passed.” Doig said it was essential at such important intervals in young people’s lives to accept their identities and not to judge them. “It’s hard enough dealing with all the social expectations as it is but to have those in authority tell you that the way you feel is unacceptable, that your emerging sexuality is an abomination in the eyes of God, must be truly horrible.” “We should be accepting these young people’s emerging identities, not judging them.”",News/Australia news,Sydney private school equates same-sex relationships and trans identity with abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/07/sydney-private-school-lists-same-sex-relationships-along-with-abusive-relationships-as-not-acceptable
2/7/2022,"Children’s access to specialist NHS mental health services in England remains “a postcode lottery”, with huge differences in spending and referrals depending on where families happen to live, according to a report. Overall, it said referrals of children and young people dropped as a result of disruption caused by the pandemic, at a time when more of them were struggling with mental health than ever before.  The report by the children’s commissioner for England said that in 2020-21 a total of 497,502 referrals were made to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) compared with 539,000 the previous year, as children became less visible to professionals such as GPs and teachers who usually make referrals. For those children accepted for treatment, the commissioner’s report said average waiting times fell from 43 days in 2019-20 to 32 days in 2020-21, though there were wide variations across England, and a third of children accepted on to waiting lists were still waiting for their treatment to begin. It is the commissioner’s fifth annual report on children’s mental health services in England, which looks at spending, access and waiting lists in 2020-21, based on data from NHS Digital and NHS England, and sheds light on the impact of the pandemic. Although referrals went down, demand increased, with one in six children suffering from a probable mental health condition, up from one in nine in 2017. As a result only about a third of children (32%) were able to access treatment, the report said. Spending on children’s mental health services went up 4.4% in real terms, but some clinical commissioning groups (CCG) chose to spend significantly less than others. The highest spend per child in 2020-21 was by NHS Isle of Wight CCG at £165, followed by Norfolk and Waveney (£152) and west London (£138). The lowest was Halton at £16 per child – down from £25 in 2019-20 – followed by Trafford and Redbridge, both at £41. Other data shows the proportion of children failing to access services because referrals were closed before starting treatment decreased to 24%, down from 27% in 2019-20 and 36% in 2018-19. Again there is wide variation, with just 8% of referrals in NHS East Sussex closed before treatment, compared with 41% in east and north Hertfordshire. Based on five key indicators, including spending on children’s mental health as a percentage of total financial allocation, mental health spend per child and total number of children’s referrals as a proportion of the under-18 population, Wakefield, Tees Valley and Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale were the top three performing CCGs. West Sussex, Coventry and Rugby and Oxfordshire were the lowest. The children’s commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza said increasing investment was making a difference. “More children have been accepted into treatment and for some children waiting times have reduced. However, there is still more to do. Some children are still waiting a long time for their treatment to begin, and many are still not accepted on to waiting lists. “There is still wide variation between local areas on what is being achieved. For example, the percentage of children waiting for treatment at the end of the year varied greatly between local areas: from as low as 14% in NHS Castle Point and Rochford and NHS Mid Essex, to 78% in NHS East Sussex.” Commenting on the findings, Mark Russell, chief executive at the Children’s Society said: “It’s clear many children need support following successive lockdowns, so it’s really concerning that referrals to CAMHS fell, with some children out of sight of professionals able to identify concerns. “Since then, following the first year of the pandemic, NHS Digital data shows there has been a surge in referrals, including for really severe mental health crises. Even before the pandemic, our research had highlighted a deeply distressing decline in children’s wellbeing, with potentially disastrous consequences. “While shorter waiting times to access treatment are welcome, the children’s commissioner’s analysis shows that far too many children are still being turned away.” The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was expanding healthcare services with an extra £2.3bn a year by 2024. “We recognise the impact the pandemic has had on everyone, especially children and young people who have faced disruption to their home lives and their education,” a spokesperson said. “That is why we have committed an additional £500m this year to support those most affected, including £79m for children’s mental health services.”",News/Society,Access to NHS mental health for children remains a ‘postcode lottery’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/access-to-nhs-mental-health-for-children-remains-a-postcode-lottery
2/7/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning.  Emmanuel Macron believes he can deliver an “historic solution” to the Ukraine crisis as he prepares to land in Moscow today for talks with Vladimir Putin on ending the standoff. Amid dire warnings from Washington that Russia could attack its neighbour “tomorrow”, the French president said he would use his previous “deep dialogue” with Putin to “de-escalate” the situation. The Russian leader did not want to invade, Macron told a French newspaper, but was merely seeking a “clarification of the rules” with Nato and the European Union. “It is our responsibility is to build a historic solution” to the problem of European security, Macron said. “I believe President Putin is available for this.” The mood music was more pessimistic in the US where national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that an invasion could take place “as soon as tomorrow”. The US thinks that Putin has amassed 70% of the firepower he needs to annex Ukraine, but the country’s former defence minister told the Guardian that Russia already had enough troops to seize any city in the country. Nevertheless, Macron spoke to Joe Biden for 40 minutes yesterday to “coordinate” his diplomatic mission, and German chancellor Olaf Scholz is heading to Washington to convince the US president he’s behind western efforts to face down Putin. Johnson reset – Allies of Boris Johnson have insisted that the “grownups” are in charge in Downing Street after the prime minister tried to rescue his premiership by rebuilding his No 10 team. Guto Harri, the former BBC journalist who is Johnson’s new communications chief, said he was “proud to join a team of capable, grownup, professional and pragmatic people”, while MP Steve Barclay becomes chief of staff. They are likely to face another tough week, however, amid calculations that the number of Tory MPs calling for a no-confidence vote is close to the 54 required to trigger a ballot. More hostile fire is also expected from Johnson’s scorned former adviser, Dominic Cummings. Revelations could involve Johnson’s wife, Carrie, who responded to a bruising weekend of press coverage by saying she had been targeted by her husband’s enemies. Peng ‘misunderstanding’ – Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai has given her first interview to an independent media organisation since she alleged on Weibo that a senior Chinese official she had been in a relationship with had coerced her into sex, saying it was an “enormous misunderstanding”. In the interview with French sports daily L’Équipe – overseen by a Chinese official – Peng said she had never accused former vice premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault and denied she had disappeared from public view afterwards. Cancer delays – The numbers of cancer patients facing delays in seeing a specialist for the first time and starting their treatment have hit record highs in England, amid fears that pandemic-hit NHS services can no longer provide prompt care. Half a million people will have to wait longer than the supposed two-week maximum to see an oncologist this year, an analysis for the House of Commons library reveals. The disclosure comes as a new row over how quickly hospitals can clear the record 6 million-strong NHS backlog has forced ministers to delay publication of the long-awaited plan to tackle it. In another problem for the NHS, a report says children’s access to specialist mental health services in England remains “a postcode lottery”, with huge differences in spending and referrals depending on where families happen to live. Ottawa emergency – The mayor of Canada’s capital declared a state of emergency last night as protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions continued to paralyse the centre of Ottawa. Residents of Ottawa are furious at the nonstop blaring of horns, traffic disruption and harassment by thousands of protesters – many of them truckers angry about vaccine mandates. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has ruled out calling in the military but Ottawa mayor Jim Watson said his emergency declaration highlighted the need for support from “other levels of government”. Messy problem – Nature reserves are being deluged with dog poo and urine in such quantities that it is likely to be damaging wildlife. A study found that the resulting overfertilisation of the ground with nitrogen and phosphorus could reach levels that would be illegal on farmland. The scientists based their conclusions on work in Belgium, but said the situation would be similar across Europe, which is home to about 87m dogs. More than 12m of them are in the UK. Dating fraudsters stole nearly £100m from lonely people in Britain last year. Lizzie Cernik reports on how these increasingly sophisticated scams work.

On the eve of the Winter Olympics, China promised the world a “streamlined, safe and most splendid” Games, but just two days into the event organisers are facing a litany of complaints from athletes and countries on multiple fronts. On the slopes, Mikaela Shiffrin’s bid for a record medal haul at the Winter Olympics got off to a rocky start on Monday morning when the American star missed a gate early in the first run of the giant slalom and was disqualified. Sadio Mané scored the winning penalty as Senegal beat Egypt 4-2 in a shoot-out after a 0-0 draw to win the Africa Cup of Nations. Eddie Jones’s decision to take Marcus Smith off at a crucial juncture in England’s Calcutta Cup defeat by Scotland was premeditated and a missed opportunity for the fly-half, according to his Harlequins coach, Tabai Matson. Non-league side Boreham Wood stunned Championship high-flyers Bournemouth with a 1-0 win that puts them in the fifth round of the FA Cup, while Steve Cooper’s emerging young Nottingham Forest side, inspired by Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence, hammered holders Leicester 4-1. Andy Murray will skip the French Open and the whole of the clay-court season as he plots his course through the rest of 2022. John Allan, chairman of Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket and largest private sector employer, has warned that he expects the economy to get worse in the coming months as the full impact of a 54% jump in energy prices flowed through. Food inflation could rise from around 1% currently to 5% by spring, he said. The FTSE 100 is looking like opening flat this morning while the pound is on $1.353 and €1.185. Images of the Queen populate just about every front page this morning and many of the papers also led with their own takes on her pronouncement about Camilla taking the regal title. “Honoured my ‘darling wife’ will be Queen,” says the Express quoting Prince Charles, but the Mail reckons “Queen gave Camilla plan her blessing years ago”. The Sun’s splash head is “Busy Lizzie” in reference to the monarch’s reappearance in the public eye after some months recuperating. The Guardian has a picture of the Queen beaming down on sightseers in Piccadilly but it leads with “Half a million people face delays in seeing NHS cancer specialist”. The Telegraph also has a health lead with “Treasury blocks PM’s plan to clear NHS backlog”, as does the Mirror: “Be Blood Donor Hero”. The Times sticks to the Downing Street mess with “Johnson hits reset button with a new No 10 team” and the i reports that “PM in crisis: 100 MPs are ready to vote against him”. The FT leads on “EU prepares gas options if Ukraine crisis hits supplies”. In Scotland, prices are the main concern.

2/7/2022,"Investment in financial tech firms in the UK grew sevenfold last year to $37.3bn (£27.5bn), according to KPMG, with London attracting more fintech funding than the rest of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) put together. The investment total was boosted by 601 deals that were finalised in the UK in 2021, the financial services firm said, up from 470 the year before.  London’s fintech boom was strengthened by the size of many of the deals, which included the $14.8bn Refinitiv deal completed in January 2021. Five out of the 10 largest fintech deals in the EMEA region were completed in the UK, it said. The report shows that while the UK sector is growing fast, it still only accounts for a fraction of the overall fintech sector. KPMG said that the total global fintech funding across the various sectors was worth $210bn – across a record 5,684 deals – in 2021. Payments continued to attract the most funding, accounting for $51.7bn in investment globally in 2021 – up from $29.1bn in 2020 – thanks to a continued surge in interest in areas such as “buy now, pay later”. Last month, the Telegraph reported that Downing Street had launched an audacious bid to lure the $45bn (£34bn) payments firm Klarna to the London Stock Exchange amid fears that high-growth companies were snubbing London for New York. Anton Ruddenklau, global fintech leader, KPMG International, said: “We’re seeing an incredible amount of interest in all manner of fintech companies, with record funding in areas like blockchain and crypto, cybersecurity, and wealthtech. While payments remain a significant driver of fintech activity, the sector is broadening every day.” In separate research also published on Monday, it emerged that the number of private equity-backed acquisitions of UK professional services firms went up 179% last year. Global law firm Mayer Brown found there were 53 such deals and said private equity (PE) funds had become increasingly interested in the sector as many professional services firms had improved their business models to create more stable income from retainer and other consultancy work. Major deals over the last few years have included spin outs of insolvency and consultancy arms of the Big Four accountancy firms. Of the 53 transactions in the past year by private equity funds, 28% were for communications firms. “Consultancy firms that have reliable streams of recurring revenue are very appealing targets for PE houses. PE funds are finding that recurring revenues don’t just exist in traditional areas of professional services like accountancy, tax and legal, but also in newer sub-sectors like PR or digital consultancy,” said Perry Yam, a Mayer Brown partner.",News/Business,UK-based financial tech firms won sevenfold funding rise last year to $37bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/07/uk-based-financial-tech-firms-won-sevenfold-funding-rise-last-year-to-37bn
2/7/2022,"Despite all the precision he brought to bear on his intricate plots, Charles Dickens was a notoriously messy writer. His manuscripts are full of inky splodges, with barely legible alterations crammed in between scrawled, sloping lines. Worse still was his love of a type of shorthand dating from the 1700s. To this, he added his own chaotic modifications to create what he called “the devil’s handwriting”. Fond of puzzles and codes, the great Victorian writer used these time-saving hieroglyphics to make notes and copies of his letters and documents, reams of which he burned. Academics are still toiling to decipher 10 shorthand manuscripts that survived. Forget Wordle. This is the Dickens Code. And for a long time, it had seemed uncrackable.  Last year, the stumped experts behind what is known as the Dickens Code project made a cry for help. They put out a call for amateur sleuths to enter a competition, the task being to transcribe one of these baffling documents: a mystery letter that has been kept for more than a century in a New York library. It is scrawled in blue ink on paper bearing the letterhead of Tavistock House, the London home where Dickens wrote Bleak House. When the competition opened last October with a £300 prize, the note was downloaded 1,000 times in three days. Participants were invited to use guides to brachygraphy, the now obsolete shorthand system that Dickens had adapted. In the semi-autobiographical David Copperfield, brachygraphy is described as a “savage stenographic mystery”. Competitors also had access to a notebook in which Dickens explained, with characteristic ambiguity, some of his own symbols. He used “@” for “about” and an angular kind of “t” to mean “extraordinary”. In the end, only 16 people, from all over the world, were able to submit solutions. None managed the entire thing. When Dickens sat down to compose the Tavistock letter, he would have been amused to consider that, almost 165 years later, it would be pulled to pieces, endlessly analysed and ultimately deciphered by, among others, a 20-year-old student from Ohio called Ken Cox. “I thought it was mind-boggling that there was something he’d written that nobody had read yet,” says Cox, a fan of puzzles, Dickens and even shorthand, who studies cognitive science at the University of Virginia. So what does the Tavistock letter say? Sadly, it is not notes for – or even part of – a long-lost short story, although there is hope that the other documents may include fiction. What it does reveal is a suitably convoluted tale of a canny businessman who has reached a fraught juncture in his love life and literary career, and is now leaning on his connections and the courts for help. “The decoders really have helped to cast light on this troubled period in Dickens’s life,” says Dr Claire Wood, lecturer in Victorian literature at the University of Leicester. Wood leads the decoding project with Hugo Bowles, professor of English at the University of Foggia in Italy. After a lengthy process of piecing the entries together and cross-checking with other sources, the pair have a transcript that is 70% complete. “I feel obliged,” the letter begins, “though very reluctantly, to appeal to you in person.” Three newly translated phrases were vital in understanding what comes next. One sleuth deduced that “HW” referred to Household Words, a periodical Dickens edited and co-owned with the publisher Bradbury and Evans. Another linked the symbol for “round” to All the Year Round, a new journal Dickens founded in 1859 and owned himself after falling out with Bradbury and Evans. In another breakthrough, one solver translated two scribbles as “Ascension Day”, a Christian feast that falls 40 days after Easter. This fascinated Wood and Bowles because Ascension Day in 1859 coincided with a period in which we know Dickens was attempting to incorporate Household Words into All the Year Round. Did the letter have something to do with this transition? These clues shed light on another letter, written in longhand fortunately, that is kept at the same New York library. It’s an apology to Dickens from the manager of the Times about a row that had erupted when Dickens asked the newspaper to print an advert alerting his existing – and potential new – readers to All the Year Round. It mentions another letter, one Dickens had written to John Thadeus Delane, editor of the Times. Until now, this letter was assumed lost. But we now know it was the Tavistock scrawl. So what did it say? It’s important first to understand where Dickens was in 1859. It was a tricky year for the writer, then 47, despite the fame he had earned with Bleak House and David Copperfield. A year earlier, his marriage had fallen apart amid salacious rumours of an affair with an actress. Dickens published a furious statement in Household Words, describing the rumours as “most grossly false, most monstrous, and most cruel-involving”. When he asked Bradbury and Evans to print the statement in Punch, which it also published, the company refused. Their relationship fell apart and the publisher declined an offer from Dickens to buy its share of Household Words. The fallout prompted Dickens to plan his own journal. But it was a risky move because, while successful, he was in financial trouble. He had a divorce, a rumoured mistress, and 10 children to pay for. “He was,” Bowles says, “a celebrity on the ropes.” Household Words, which Dickens launched in 1850, was a vital source of income and a shop window for his work. It had taken off in 1854 with the serialisation of his novel Hard Times. Dickens was desperate to hold on to his readers but Bradbury and Evans had other ideas. They wanted to keep Household Words alive without him – and sued to prevent him from giving the impression the magazine was closing. However, a judge ruled in Dickens’s favour: yes, he could announce the switch, as long as he said Household Words was being “discontinued by him” and not the publisher. A triumphant Dickens used this phrase in the advert intended for the Times, but a clerk rejected it. Unaware of the legal ruling, the clerk felt the advert gave the false impression that Household Words was indeed being shut down. “A cancelled advert in the Times came as a nasty surprise to Dickens,” Bowles says, “and needed to be rectified.” The Tavistock letter is, we now know, the writer’s desperate bid to rescue the situation by appealing to the editor, an acquaintance. Dickens refers to the advert “announcing that, after Ascension Day, Household Words will be discontinued by me … [It] was refused and sent back with a message that this particular was untrue and unfair.” He mentions the judge’s ruling approvingly, saying he can see no “sense or reason” for the rejection. The Times swiftly apologised and reinstated the advert. Dickens had won. All the Year Round, which he launched with the first instalment of A Tale of Two Cities, was a sensation. A year later, it serialised Great Expectations. Meanwhile, Bradbury and Evans failed to save Household Words. When they auctioned its title, Dickens snapped it up at a fraction of the price he had originally offered, churlishly adding the line “With Which Is Incorporated Household Words” to the cover of All the Year Round. The academics have been stunned to learn about Dickens’s ruthless business dealings – and amused by his legal double standards. “I mean, he’s usually scathing about judges,” Bowles says. “And here he is quoting the judge, naming him in the letter, and saying what a great guy he is for supporting him.” Yet Wood senses vulnerability too. “Dickens is riding high,” she says, “but also feeling these personal and professional pressures and trying to keep all the plates spinning.” The £300 prize was won by Shane Baggs, a Californian IT worker and code enthusiast, who solved the most symbols. “After getting mostly C grades in literature,” he says, “I never dreamed anything I’d ever do would be of interest to Dickens scholars.” Cox, who as a child wrote coded letters to friends after being inspired by a book about Britain’s wartime codebreaker Alan Turing, contributed solutions including the words “untrue and unfair”. He says: “When I turned it in, I thought I was on the right track. But then I thought they might get a ton of letters and be like, ‘Well, most of these are fine – but this dude’s just looks like the plot of Legally Blonde.’” The Dickens Code project, which is funded by the government’s Arts and Humanities Research Council, will run for another year. Wood and Bowles want to grow their band of sleuths to help transcribe more documents, some much messier than the Tavistock letter. One series of notes is headed Anecdote, in longhand. “Now,” says Bowles, excitement building in his voice, “I think that could be Dickens telling a story we’ve never heard.”  More details about the Dickens Code project here.",Arts/Books,Forget Wordle!

2/7/2022,"Unions have urged the government to do more to help low-paid workers weather the cost of living crisis, after research found the number claiming universal credit has more than doubled since the start of the pandemic to at least 2.3 million. The TUC said the 1.3 million increase in working universal credit claimants had been caused by households being pushed into financial hardship during Covid and called for a substantial rise in the payments and a higher minimum wage to head off a “perfect storm” of costs coming in spring.  From 1 April, energy bills will rise on average by £700 to £2,000 a year and a few days later the chancellor’s 1.25% national insurance surcharge will start hitting wage packets. Unfixed mortgages will start rising in March, while food, rent and other prices have all been increasing at their fastest rate for 30 years. While the Treasury announced some support on Thursday to mitigate the squeeze, the TUC said that without further intervention, millions more working people would find themselves pushed below the breadline. Low-paid workers, mostly those with young children, are able to top up their incomes by applying for universal credit, and about 40% of all claimants are in work. The TUC said 12% of workers told researchers that they expected to struggle to afford the basics in the next six months, while 22% said they would find it hard to afford “more than the basics”. The analysis found that a fifth of workers have Christmas debts to pay off this year, a number that rises to more than a quarter for workers with children of school age. Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, said ministers need to urgently raise universal credit payments to 80% of the living wage – which is set to rise to £9.50 in April. “The government must do far more to help struggling families get through the tough times ahead. The support package announced by the chancellor last week is woefully inadequate,” she said. “Universal credit urgently needs boosting and we need further action to reduce fuel costs for those battling to make ends meet. The best way to give working families long-term financial security is to get pay rising across the economy.” O’Grady’s call for the minimum wage to rise to at least £10 an hour will put her further at odds with the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, who caused a storm of protest last week when he called on Britons to show wage restraint to stop inflation spiralling out of control. Bailey, who earns close to £600,000 a year, made the comments a day after the Bank raised interest rates to 0.5%, and warned household disposable incomes were on track to shrink by 2% this year, the biggest fall since comparable records began in 1990. In the face of the cost of living crisis, Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson have come under pressure to scrap the national insurance surcharge, which Labour has called the “wrong tax at the wrong time”. On Monday the Federation of Small Business (FSB) added its voice to the calls to axe the increase, joining the likes of the Institute of Directors. The UK’s largest business group called for the surcharge to be ditched to reverse the 250,000 drop in the number of young people being offered apprenticeships. The FSB national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “By looking again at its approach to NICs, the government can make a real difference here – directly, by bringing down the immediate costs of taking an apprentice on, and indirectly, by freeing up more funds for recruitment and training at a moment when cash reserves are depleted.” Economic data released on Monday by the financial services firm Deloitte said consumer confidence fell to -11% during the last quarter of 2021 as consumers started to feel the squeeze.

As we rejoin the almost-couple Jessie and Tom, there are hints of commitment but they’re generally spiked by Jessie’s insecurity and Tom’s diffidence. The writing has a good handle on the sense of stasis that can attach itself to rootless twentysomethings adrift among the excitement and impossibilities of London. And the couple’s attraction and confusion always plays out in plausibly human and relatable ways. Phil Harrison Kathy (Sheridan Smith) sees her family holiday become a nightmare when her son Noah (Louis Ashbourne Serkis) is arrested for sexual assault. As golden-hued footage of swimming pools gives way to the tense sound of fizzing electronica, this tense drama leaves you guessing. Is Noah guilty, or has he been framed?

Hannah Verdier You’re Next (Adam Wingard, 2011), 9pm, Horror ChannelThanks to the commercial success of last year’s Godzilla vs Kong, Adam Wingard now firmly has his feet under the Hollywood table. But whatever he chooses to do next, it’s unlikely to better the panache of his 2011 breakout hit You’re Next. The joy of this cheap, grimy slasher movie is in how lightly it wears its premise. In any other hands, a story like this – about intruders in animal masks systematically offing a group of semi-likable victims – would be a gruesome sludge of a thing. Wingard, though, fills the movie with endless wit, black humour and wild invention. Beautiful.

2/7/2022,"On Monday night, the moon serves as a signpost for one of the ultimate naked-eye astronomy challenges. Uranus, the seventh planet of the solar system, hovers at the very limit of naked-eye visibility.  To stand any chance of seeing the planet, which orbits 19 times further from the sun than the Earth, you will need to be under the darkest sky you can possibly find. For most of us, a pair of binoculars will be needed. The planet spends the entire year within the confines of Aries, the ram. It will become slightly brighter in early November this year, when it draws close to Earth, so consider this a practice run. The chart shows the view looking south-west from London at 18.00 GMT Monday evening. The moon is a waxing crescent. With 42% of its visible surface illuminated, it is rapidly approaching its first quarter phase. The light from the moon will wipe out any chance of seeing Uranus with the naked eye on Monday night, but it does provide a signpost to be remembered for other nights. From the southern hemisphere, binoculars will definitely be needed because the planet is currently at a much lower altitude.",News/Science,Starwatch: time for one of the ultimate naked-eye challenges,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/07/starwatch-time-for-one-of-the-ultimate-naked-eye-challenges
2/7/2022,"First came soya, nut and then oat but the new challenger to the plant milk crown is the humble spud as potato milk arrives on UK supermarket shelves. Described as “deliciously creamy” and capable of producing the “perfect foam” for a homemade latte or cappuccino, the Swedish potato milk brand Dug goes on sale in 220 Waitrose stores this week.  Sales of plant-based alternatives to milk are booming in the UK with the market now worth about £400m a year as Britons reduce their consumption of animal products. In recent years the buzz has been around oat milk, thanks to the success of rival Swedish brand Oatly, but in its recent food and drink report Waitrose predicted that in 2022 it would be “the turn of the potato”. Waitrose said that in 2021 its sales of plant-based milk were almost a fifth higher than in 2019 as alt-dairy entered the mainstream. Oat milk is the current bestseller, ahead of almond, soya and coconut, it said. Waitrose’s alternative milk buyer, Alice Shrubsall, said sales of the products had “gone from strength-to-strength over the past few years” adding: “Demand hasn’t slowed in this market and we’re seeing customers become more experimental with their alternative milk choices.” Emma Källqvist, the acting chief executive of Veg of Lund which owns the Dug brand, said its arrival on the high street was a “critical milestone” for the company. It is already available online on sites such as Amazon and Ocado. For many alt-milk fans the attraction is they offer a route to reducing the environmental impact of their diet due to the level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional dairy farming. However, the Advertising Standards Authority recently banned a marketing campaign by Oatly, ruling that the green claims made were misleading. Made in the UK, Dug’s ingredients include pea protein and rapeseed oil as well as potato. It describes itself as “super sustainable” and has worked with CarbonCloud, a firm that calculates the climate footprint of foods, to assess its environmental credentials. Dug says its footprint is significantly lower than dairy milk. Growing potatoes is twice as efficient as oats and the crop uses less water than nuts like almonds, it says. Ophélie Buchet, global food and drink analyst at market research firm Mintel, says potato milk has the potential to displace oat as a more sustainable dairy-free milk alternative “without asking consumers to compromise on nutrition, price or taste”. However, the cost of potato milk will be key to its long-term success as the higher price of plant milks is the “number one” thing that stops consumers buying them, according to Mintel. Dug’s “barista” version costs £1.80 for a litre versus 90p for 1.1 litres of Waitrose’s cheapest own-brand cow’s milk. As well as price some shoppers also complain about the taste of plant milks. Potato milk is described as having a “neutral” flavour that means it can be mixed in tea and coffee, poured on breakfast cereal or used in cooking without overpowering the drink or dish. However, other reviews have painted a less flattering picture suggesting it has a “saline aftertaste”. Potatoes have a big hill to climb if they are going to challenge the supremacy of oat, now the biggest selling plant-milk, or dairy – cow’s milk is still a far bigger market, worth more than £3bn. Potatoes are a very “niche” ingredient representing on average less than 0.2% of plant milk launches, but high profile debuts like DUG could change that, adds Buchet.",News/Business,Skinny spud latte to go?

2/7/2022,"Nipsey Hussle’s family is planning to open “The Marathon Clothing store No 2” in Los Angeles this year, fulfilling a longtime dream of the late rapper. Samiel Asghedom, Hussle’s older brother, said his family had purchased commercial property in the Melrose arts district in LA and will open The Marathon store No 2 there for the popular clothing brand.  “This second location is a dream that Nipsey always had, and it’s important that his kids are able to see his plans fulfilled,” said Asghedom, 39. The original store at Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson Avenue, is closed but will remain a site where fans can visit and pay tribute, he said. The surrounding commercial lot that the family owns will eventually be transformed into a community space offering free music lessons for youth, modeled after an impactful program Hussle completed as a kid. The Melrose avenue shop, which is being remodeled and does not have a launch date yet, is just one piece of Asghedom’s efforts to carry on his brother’s legacy in LA. Last year, the Guardian revealed that the Los Angeles police department and city officials had targeted the family’s flagship south LA store on Slauson Avenue through a secretive surveillance program and failed eviction attempt. The Marathon clothing store launched formally in 2017, cementing Crenshaw and Slauson as the corner synonymous with Hussle’s name. The project had been years in the making. Hussle had always had big ambitions. In one interview, the artist recalled being eight or nine years old and dreaming of being a professional musician signed to a label by the time he was 12. Success didn’t come that early, but Asghedom recalled his brother writing songs as a young teenager, and at one point collecting old computer parts from auctions and building a PC for himself so he could record music. As a teen, Hussle started trying to make money at the lot on Crenshaw and Slauson by selling CDs out of his trunk. Across the street, Asghedom and his business partner, Stephen Donelson, used to sell clothing outside of a Louisiana Fried Chicken, though LA police department (LAPD) officers would frequently shut them down – sometimes, handcuffing them and seizing their merchandise. “We were like damn, you’re not doing this to nobody else selling food on the corner. We are trying to do something legit. And they were like, ‘No it’s not legit until you’ve got a location and pay taxes and pay rent like everybody else.’” The brothers opened the Slauson Tees store in 2006, on the corner where Hussle had first sold CDs out of his car. The brothers’ businesses went through multiple iterations, until they launched The Marathon Clothing in 2017. Before its grand opening, though, Hussle had considered whether to move The Marathon Clothing to Melrose, another popular shopping area near West Hollywood where he thought they might have fewer conflicts with police, Asghedom said. “We were almost swayed to just abandon it and open somewhere else – we knew it would work,” Asghedom said. “But Hussle was like, ‘Let’s just go ahead and bite the bullet and take whatever comes with it. The first Marathon clothing store has to be open on Crenshaw and Slauson.’” The shop was a huge hit, though the LAPD presence on the corner intensified, according to the family and police records. As LA officials attempted to force the landlord to evict the store in 2019 – claiming it was a “nuisance” and site of gang activity – Hussle and his business partners instead bought the property from the owners. Soon after, Hussle was killed outside of the store. There has since been an outpouring of support for the brand online, Asghedom said, and the new store will offer a brick-and-mortar destination while carrying out Hussle’s vision for a Melrose shop. Asghedom said it was important to also continue his brother’s legacy at Crenshaw and Slauson, and do it in a way that was not commercial. The family’s long-term vision for the original location is to build a youth center, reopen the Steve’s Barber Shop as a place to give free haircuts to youth, and to have some kind of museum or public site that commemorates Hussle: “We want a place where tourists and fans can come to pay homage versus a place that was all about sales.” Hussle’s participation in a free music production program for youth in the Watts neighborhood had been transformative, Asghedom said, and Hussle wanted to replicate that in his neighborhood. “Everybody out of that program, including my brother, ended up pursuing a successful music career,” he said. “Just a little effort and a little resources directed toward the youth can really make a big impact … So a youth center would be the best thing we could put there, in the vein of what Hussle stood for: something to inspire the youth and teach them skills that they can use to be productive and legitimate when they become adults.” David Gross, Hussle’s business partner who helped him buy the lot, said that taking ownership of the lot was “profound and poetic” for Hussle and his drive to champion community entrepreneurship: “Whatever we do, it will be an enduring piece of Nipsey’s legacy and what he meant to the neighborhood … it will be there after I’m long gone.” Gross is also reopening Vector90, the south LA co-working space he and Hussle founded in 2018, which has been closed since the pandemic. There have also been ongoing rumors about Hussle’s unreleased music, including a recent announcement that new tracks would be released as an NFT, which Asghedom said was unauthorized and the family has since shut down. But there are unreleased tracks, he said: “It’s quality, classic stuff. People are going to be really excited about it. There’s a lot of music that nobody has heard, all of it dope.” Hussle had a very specific vision for Victory Lap, his debut (and final) studio album released in 2018, which meant that some tracks didn’t make the final cut: “There were records we knew could’ve been a radio smash,” Asghedom said. “We’d say, You gotta put that on the album,’ but he was like, ‘Nah, fuck the sales, fuck commercial success that this record could get. This record doesn’t fit Victory Lap. The album concept has to have a flow and a cadence and I want Victory Lap to be perfect.’” But Asghedom said he doesn’t want to release the records as a “second album”: “For us, there will always only be one album: Victory Lap. That’s what Nip put out, and we don’t want to go around compiling new music and saying this is a second album.” His hope is to release new music as part of the soundtrack to a documentary, to help tell the story of his brother’s life. Asghedom said his family has been humbled by the outpouring of love for Hussle, seen in murals across LA and in the way so many people reference his story: “People from all walks of life have shown their love and respect for Nip: reporters, book writers, actors, doctors, lawyers, athletes, everybody … They understood what Nip was trying to do and the mantra and the movement of the Marathon. That’s what Nip wanted – to inspire people. I think that was his genius.”",Arts/Music,Nipsey Hussle’s family to open Marathon store No 2: ‘Fulfilling his dream’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/nipsey-hussle-the-marathon-clothing-store-los-angeles
2/7/2022,"There is a literary and cinematic device that usually signals the protagonist has entered a world that may look normal but is in fact slightly off. A clock might start moving backwards; a ball might be thrown in the air and keep rising, disappearing into the sky. The main character in Christopher Nolan’s Inception, for example, moves between reality and complex dream worlds. When he can no longer tell the difference between the two, he uses a small silver spinning top as a reality check. If it loses momentum and stops spinning, he is awake. If it continues to spin, he is asleep, lost in an uncontrollable nightmare. Since news of No 10’s parties started being leaked to the press, many of us have become that anxious man, desperately waiting for the spinning top to slow down and topple over: for Boris Johnson to resign; for his party to finally boot him out; for some sign that we are not living in a world where the rules no longer apply. Every time speculation about the 54 letters required to trigger a no-confidence vote has intensified, or a senior Tory has broken cover and condemned Johnson, or a report has confirmed partying during lockdown and “failures of leadership”, the spinning top has slowed, as it has seemed certain that not another day could pass with Johnson still in office.  But it’s been weeks now. To be precise, it’s been more than two months since the first news broke of Johnson attending a party. Since then, there have been reports of the prime minister crying and broken, apologising to people in the halls of Downing Street like a drunk punter in a nightclub toilet after a bad breakup. Anonymous sources and their eager handlers brought us such final pronouncements as “it’s over”, “the letters will be in by 5pm”, describing Johnson as “downcast and defeated”. All this may not have necessarily implied a swift departure, but what it certainly didn’t suggest was that, only days later, this same man would be accusing the opposition leader of failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile and implying the Labour frontbench took drugs. The likelihood is that all these events amount to a slow bleed, rather than an immediate fall. Johnson’s renewed fight (if the reports that he was flagging are to be believed) is the frantic flailing of a man on the ropes. But it’s a hell of a slow bleed. Something always seems to stem it. A fortunately timed defection of one Tory MP to Labour snatched the no-confidence letters back. A Metropolitan police investigation, also well timed, filed down the teeth of Sue Gray’s report. A belligerent Vladimir Putin appeared to threaten (again, what timing!) an invasion of Ukraine. Yet there are only so many excuses one can make before one realises it’s not a series of last-minute lifesavers that have prevented Johnson’s departure; it’s the ecosystem that allows him to remain. In this ecosystem, the norms that once tied action to consequence have been severed. For years now, the Conservative party has honed a political programme in which lying – and the styling-out of lies – is central to how the party runs business. From the false claims MPs made about the windfalls that Brexit would deliver to the NHS, to denying the reality of national PPE shortages, the guiding principle among Tory MPs has been to lie first and avoid questions later. If truly cornered, they switch to a strategy of attacking and undermining – judges, the media, human rights lawyers, the EU, the civil service, Tory party members themselves who don’t toe the line. Johnson’s appointment as party leader was a victory for a 2016 vintage of politics that combined aggression and relentless dissimulation. And it has worked. With Johnson as its battering ram, the government has managed to make it through the highest Covid death toll in Europe, several corruption scandals and a barely scrutinised Brexit deal. To achieve this sort of licence, all the chips were put on one man with one style of leadership. But what happens when that style, that man, becomes the liability? Well, you look for alternatives and you muster some moral courage to do the right thing. But Johnson and party impunity, both so diligently promoted over the past few years, mean it is nearly impossible to reverse course without blowing up the entire operation. And so what should have been a straightforward and swift matter of political principle that ended in Johnson’s resignation has become something else entirely. Kremlinology and political calculations fill the moral void as MPs and advisers try to figure out the cost to their own careers. It’s no coincidence that the two most high-profile MPs to criticise Johnson – the failed Brexit secretary David Davis and the former prime minister Theresa May, whose Home Office was responsible for the Windrush scandal – have already cashed in their chips and absconded with their own legacies intact. In the meantime, Johnson gets what he wants, which is to live another day, then another, and another, as the rest mull over the question: how to restore gravity without bringing the entire party crashing down in the process? Who, apart from Johnson, can cheerfully bluster through the disasters of Brexit and pandemic mismanagement, and lie with such effortless conviction? If your product is a con, you need a conman. This is why it is taking so long. This is why rejoicing in the latest harms to Johnson’s reputation feels more like a nervous, drawn-out affair than a relief. In theory, yes, there is a limit to what any politician can get away with in a democratic society. In theory, yes, what goes up must come down. But in practice, when an entire government has been built on fantasy and false promises, restoring the codes of reality is costly. It must be done slowly and carefully, as the party and modern conservatism steer away from Johnson and Brexit populism. But towards what? While they figure that out, Johnson remains, even as a dead man walking, and the silver top continues to spin.
