12/24/2021,"The head of the Department of Home Affairs, Michael Pezzullo, was kept out of the loop on the Aukus pact, as new documents show Australia’s initial investigation into nuclear-powered submarines was to be handled on a “strictly need-to-know basis”. The announcement of Aukus – described by the Biden administration as the “biggest strategic step that Australia has taken in generations” – triggered a diplomatic rift with France, objections from China, and a mixture of support and concerns among south-east Asian nations.  Based on documents obtained under freedom of information laws, other public records and conversations with informed sources, Guardian Australia can report new details about how the “forever” partnership with the US and the UK fell into place. The secretive talks were first driven by the Morrison government’s pursuit of nuclear-powered submarines – the first Aukus project – but evolved into a broader pledge to “significantly deepen cooperation on a range of emerging security and defence capabilities”. When Aukus was finally announced in September, the government said the cooperation would include “cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities”. Despite the emphasis on cyber and emerging technologies, the Department of Home Affairs – a key national security agency with responsibility for domestic cybersecurity – appears to have not played any significant role in landing the Aukus pact. Pezzullo has had a high public profile this year, in part because of his controversial comments in April warning that “free nations again hear the beating drums” and were “bracing again, yet again, for the curse of war” to protect “our precious liberty”. There was also speculation earlier this year that he might follow his former boss, Peter Dutton, into the defence department, where Pezzullo served earlier in his career. It is not mentioned in the documents but Guardian Australia has established that Pezzullo was first briefed about Aukus on 16 September 2021. That was the same day the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced the deal with his UK counterpart, Boris Johnson, and the US president, Joe Biden, in a video conference at 7am Canberra time. The revelation Pezzullo was not part of the Aukus deliberations shows the extent to which the highly sensitive talks with the US and the UK were kept to a small group. Within the public service, the Department of Defence played the leading role, while the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was also part of a small taskforce that negotiated the still-secret agreements in the US in August this year. The prime minister’s office and several key officials in his department were also involved. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said Aukus activities were “being led and coordinated by the Department of Defence” – but signalled it was now involved with delivery. “The Department of Home Affairs is working with the Department of Defence to support whole-of-government efforts to deliver Aukus initiatives.” On 25 May 2020, the chief of navy, Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, signed the terms of reference for a “nuclear submarine feasibility study taskforce”. The details were for “limited distribution” only. While it has been previously reported Commodore Timothy Brown led this taskforce, more details about his initial assignment can now be revealed as a result of an FOI application. The taskforce’s main purpose was to “understand the feasibility of Australia acquiring, operating and sustaining nuclear submarines in the short to medium term”, according to a heavily redacted document obtained from the defence department. Despite the “short to medium term” focus, Morrison has since said he expects the first of the new submarines to be operating by about 2040. The taskforce’s key principles included that it should collect and assess information “that both supports and contests the capability options presented” and operate on a “strictly need-to-know basis”. The taskforce was also asked to incorporate “whole of government considerations, including strategic, industrial and international relations assessments and implications” – in other words, to weigh up the potential fallout. The questions about Australia accessing nuclear-propelled submarine technology included: “Who could it be obtained from, how, and when?” Another question was how Australia could operate and sustain nuclear submarines, and what industrial base would be required to support such an acquisition – questions that remain open. A flowchart suggests Brown’s reporting line was to Noonan, the navy chief, but ultimately the work was conducted with the knowledge of and oversight by the defence secretary, Greg Moriarty, and the chief of the ADF, General Angus Campbell. The report was due by December 2020. The month after that report’s completion, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, was first briefed about the submarine-related reviews Morrison had commissioned, according to evidence to Senate estimates. Then, on 11 February 2021, Moriarty and Campbell wrote to Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead to launch a defence capability enhancement review – in line with a direction from the then defence minister, Linda Reynolds. The three-page letter, originally marked SECRET AUSTEO (Australian Eyes Only) but also obtained under FOI, said Australia’s strategic circumstances had deteriorated and warned that “the rapid introduction of more advanced submarines, sensors and weapons will further complicate the subsurface threat environment over the coming decades”. “Submarines are fundamental to the nation’s maritime security. They secure Australia’s strategic advantage and underpin Australia’s credibility and influence as a modern military power.” Moriarty and Campbell asked Mead to report back on changes in the maritime threat environment against the backdrop of “faster than envisaged” military modernisation in the Indo-Pacific – an obvious reference to China. The letter cited “intensifying” major-power competition and the undermining of confidence in the rules-based order. “Your review is afforded the highest priority and you are to advise us as to the resources you require,” Moriarty and Campbell told Mead. The chief defence scientist was made aware of the government’s interest in acquiring nuclear submarines on 10 March 2021 – the same month the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation was first consulted. But the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency “was not consulted in the lead up to the announcement on 16 September 2021”, a response to a Senate question on notice reveals. The Morrison government formed the view by about April 2021 that the idea of Australia receiving US help to acquire nuclear-powered submarines could advance into the American political system, sources said. That is the same month Andrew Shearer, a foreign policy hawk now serving as the head of the Office of National Intelligence and who is an influential source of strategic advice to Morrison, met with Biden’s top Indo-Pacific adviser, Kurt Campbell. The precise details of the 30 April meeting in Washington DC have not yet been publicly disclosed, but the talks were evidently important: Moriarty told Senate estimates he was “aware of that meeting either on the day or shortly after”. Australian officials have drawn a distinction between the original submarine capability-driven talks and the broader idea of trumpeting a wider security partnership under the “Aukus” banner. The latter appeared to have been driven at a political level, including by Morrison. Moriarty said he was first aware of the idea of a formal partnership in May or June, “as the prime minister was thinking about the framing”. The new secretary of Dfat, Kathryn Campbell, was briefed on the Aukus “package” on 27 July, the day after she started in the top foreign affairs role, although a number of her officials were aware earlier. After Morrison, Biden and Johnson sketched out the broad parameters of a deal in a meeting on the sidelines of the G7 in June, officials from the three countries gathered in Washington DC in mid-August to negotiate two key documents. These memoranda of understanding – one related to the submarine project and the other to the broader Aukus partnership – have never been released. The Australian negotiating team was led by Mead – the one who oversaw the earlier capability review, and who is now in charge of yet another taskforce that will spend 18 months figuring out the “optimal” pathway to deliver these submarines. Newly released White House visitor logs for that month show Mead was among four Australian officials who dropped in to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington DC on 17 August. The other Australian officials included Australia’s ambassador for arms control and counter-proliferation, Amanda Gorely, and the Australian embassy’s naval attache, Commodore Mathew Hudson. Also in attendance was Scott Dewar, who earlier this year was listed as the director of the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation. Sources familiar with the matter said the group met with Kurt Campbell, and it should not be a surprise that such meetings were held in the run-up to the Aukus announcement. Guardian Australia has established Gorely was also a member of the interagency negotiating group, along with a small number of other Dfat officials, in a sign Canberra anticipated the implications of Aukus for nuclear proliferation could become contentious. Australia would be the first non-nuclear weapons state to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. Indonesia and Malaysia later raised concerns Aukus could pose non-proliferation issues, and China is pressing for the International Atomic Energy Agency to launch a special committee to review the matter. “Australia has made clear it is committed to meeting all of its nuclear non-proliferation obligations and to maintaining the strongest possible non-proliferation standards in relation to Australia’s acquisition of conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarines,” a Dfat spokesperson said. Payne travelled to the region last month in a bid to reassure Indonesia and Malaysia. The diplomatic ramifications continue to reverberate, with the French government still furious with the Australian government over its handling of the scrapping of the $90bn deal for 12 conventionally powered submarines, claiming it was deliberately kept in the dark. Letters from the Australian defence department to France’s Naval Group a week before the Aukus announcement, and also hours before, released under FOI, painted a positive picture of progress being made against technical issues with the French plans. Naval Group was informed of the cancellation the night before the announcement. The department confirmed that defence leadership had received written advice from the section managing the then-project “regarding progress on the Attack class submarine program” – but it has not released that. As for the new submarines, it remains the government’s “intention” to build them in Adelaide – but nothing has been locked in yet, nor the costs and delivery dates, as Mead’s taskforce continues talks with American and British counterparts. All of these are not due to be finalised until after the federal election. “Defence is not ruling any design option out at this time, however the design that is selected must be mature at the time of build,” the Defence Department said in response to a Senate question on notice. “This includes current and potential future UK and US designs.”",News/Australia news,Home affairs boss Michael Pezzullo was kept out of secret Aukus deliberations,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/home-affairs-boss-michael-pezzullo-was-kept-out-of-secret-aukus-deliberations
12/24/2021,"A fourth woman has come forward to accuse Chris Noth of sexual assault, days after the actor best known for his character Mr Big on Sex and the City was fired from the CBS TV drama The Equalizer. Singer-songwriter Lisa Gentile gave an account on Thursday that Noth had forcibly kissed and groped her in her New York apartment after she met him at Da Marino, a restaurant in midtown Manhattan where another of Noth’s accusers has said she was assaulted by the actor.  Gentile said she met Noth in 1998, when they were both regulars at the restaurant. One night in 2002, he gave her a ride home and asked to see her apartment. Gentile said he pushed her against a countertop, forcibly kissed her and groped her breasts. “He was slobbering all over me, and I quickly became uncomfortable. He became more aggressive, put both hands on my breasts and began squeezing them very hard over my shirt,” she said on Thursday at a press conference. Gentile, who alleges Noth then put his hands under her shirt, said she tried to push him off. “I kept pushing his hands down while he was pushing mine up. I was trying to get him to stop. Then he pushed my hands down toward his penis.” After she managed to push him away, she recalled “he became extremely angry and started screaming and calling me a tease and a bitch. He stormed out of my apartment.” The next morning, Gentile added, Noth called, warning her that “if I ever told about what happened the night before that he would ruin my career that I would never see him again and that he would blacklist me from the business.” “I was afraid to come forward because of Noth’s power and his threats to ruin my career,” Gentile said, adding that she was going public now to support the women who spoke out before her, anonymously, and to call for laws to extend legal limitations on adult claims of sexual assault. The new account follows claims by three other women who say the actor sexually assaulted them between 2004 and 2015. Noth has previously described the allegations as “categorically false”. “These stories could’ve been from 30 years ago or 30 days ago – no always means no – that is a line I did not cross,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “The encounters were consensual,” he added. “It’s difficult not to question the timing of these stories coming out. I don’t know for certain why they are surfacing now, but I do know this: I did not assault these women.” Noth’s co-stars in Sex and The City and its sequel And Just Like That – Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristen Davis – jointly voiced their support for his accusers. Noth could not be immediately reached for comment on Gentile’s allegations. Representatives for the actor had no comment on Thursday.

12/24/2021,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have released the first picture of their daughter, Lilibet, with Meghan holding up the laughing child in an image on their Christmas card. The photo, which also shows Prince Harry with curly haired Archie on his knee, was taken by Alexi Lubomirski this summer at the couple’s home in Santa Barbara, California.  No images of six-month-old Lilibet, named after the Queen’s childhood nickname, have been released before now, and her two-year-old brother’s face has rarely been seen in public. The message on the card reads: “This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a ‘Mama’ and a ‘Papa’, and Lili made us a family. As we look forward to 2022, we have made donations on your behalf to several organizations that honor and protect families – from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave: Team Rubicon, Welcome.US, Human First Coalition, Humanity Crew & Paid Leave For All, PL+US, Marshall Plan for Moms. Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours! As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie & Lili.” A statement from Harry and Meghan’s Archewell foundation confirmed that the couple had made contributions to the charities, including Welcome.US, which helps Afghan refugees settle in the country, and Team Rubicon, which mobilises military veterans for disaster response. The couple will celebrate Christmas with their children at their US home, to where they relocated from the UK in March 2020. Clarence House has confirmed the Queen will spend Christmas Day with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. The monarch had said she would remain in Windsor for Christmas amid the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant. The Queen normally hosts her large family at Sandringham in Norfolk, where they are usually watched by crowds as they attend church on 25 December, although Covid meant this did not happen last year. The Queen also cancelled a traditional pre-Christmas lunch with her extended family, which had been scheduled for Tuesday. Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday that a service of thanksgiving for the life of the Duke of Edinburgh would take place in spring 2022 at Westminster Abbey. The Queen’s Christmas Day message, to be broadcast at 3pm, is expected to be a particularly personal one this year, as she prepares for her first festive period since the death of the duke. A photograph released by Buckingham Palace ahead of her televised address shows the Queen sitting behind a desk in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, accompanied by a single, framed picture of the couple taken in 2007 at Broadlands country house, Hampshire, to mark their diamond wedding anniversary. The handout from the palace shows the Queen wearing an embossed wool shift dress in Christmas red, by British designer Angela Kelly, as well as a sapphire chrysanthemum brooch which the then-Princess Elizabeth wore for a photocall on her honeymoon, also to Broadlands, in 1947, and for the couple’s diamond wedding celebrations. This year’s message follows the death of the duke in April aged 99, while coronavirus restrictions at the time meant the Queen was memorably and poignantly forced to sit alone in St George’s Chapel for his funeral service.

12/24/2021,"Steve Clarke has dropped a heavy hint that Ryan Fraser will not feature for Scotland any time soon. Fraser irked the Scotland coaching staff by withdrawing from the squad for crucial matches against Moldova and Denmark last month citing a calf problem, but was subsequently pictured on the training ground of his club, Newcastle United. Clarke has revealed that he has not spoken with Fraser and has no apparent desire to do so. “He wasn’t involved through his own choice in the November games,” the manager said. “To be honest I don’t think we missed him. I thought the team was good in both games so Ryan could have his work cut out to be back in the squad. That’s just the nature of the competition for places. It’s not a squad that you want to give up your place in lightly.”  The manager reaffirmed his earlier position of not “pestering” his players between international camps in respect of whether he should hold a meeting with Fraser. It is clear, though, that he demands firm commitment from all squad members. “It’s a conversation for March [before Scotland play Ukraine],” Clarke said. “He has to get into his team. He doesn’t play regularly at Newcastle, he is in and out of the team. “I wouldn’t like to think the whole year ends up speaking about someone who’s chosen not to be in the squad rather than the boys who have. Lyndon Dykes came to play when his ankle was hanging off. He came and he tried a training session. He wanted to fly to Moldova just to watch. He joined us in Glasgow and took part in a training session and five minutes into the session you could see the boy was injured. But he didn’t want to admit it because he wanted to be part of the team and he wanted to play against Denmark. That’s the type of player I want.” Having originally been confident of an amnesty regarding bookings and potential suspensions carried over from qualifying groups into World Cup play-offs, Clarke now believes the existing scenario will stand. “We will have eight or nine on a yellow card against Ukraine with the threat of missing the final if we got there,” he said. “That’s a shame.”",Sport/Football,Steve Clarke hints Ryan Fraser not in Scotland plans after missing games,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/steve-clarke-hints-ryan-fraser-not-in-scotland-plans-after-missing-games
12/24/2021,"Mikel Arteta knows time is ticking on Arsenal’s efforts to resolve the futures of their senior strikers, several of whom enter the second half of the season with their next career moves in serious doubt. Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are out of contract at the end of the campaign, with little headway having been made in keeping them on. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, usually the first-choice centre-forward, is currently frozen out after a string of misdemeanours that lost him the captaincy, and the promising Folarin Balogun is likely to see his suitability for senior football assessed in a loan move. It leaves the in-form Gabriel Martinelli, contracted until at least 2024, as the only striker whose prospects appear secure.  Asked about the cloud hanging over his front line, Arteta said: “We have a cloud and the cloud is there and, at the moment, we’re not able to change it. We’re working on it to try to make it as small as possible and as clear as possible, but it’s the situation we are in because contracts have details, the timing of them is tricky and we are trying to resolve it.” The situation is particularly uncertain given Nketiah and Lacazette, who might once have been considered dispensable, have impressed Arteta in recent weeks. He is delighted with the way Lacazette has stepped up since taking the armband from Aubameyang, and he reiterated that he would like Nketiah to stay after the 22-year-old scored a hat-trick against Sunderland in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday. At 30, Lacazette is unlikely to be a viable long-term option and would be more expensive, and Nketiah wants regular top-flight football and has turned down a new deal. Arteta admitted he may have to make tough calls about players whose contracts are running down. “It depends on every single case, depends on the player’s situation, the minutes he’s playing, his willingness or the offer that you have,” he said. “But it’s something that you have to consider.” Arteta gave short shrift to the suggestion Aubameyang had carte blanche to depart, saying he would not discuss individuals. He did not explicitly rule out a return to action for the former captain in the Boxing Day fixture at Norwich, although that would appear unlikely. Aubameyang’s exile has, accurately or not, drawn parallels with Mesut Özil’s omission from the squad last year. Arteta was asked whether the two episodes owed to an overly uncompromising approach to different characters. “I don’t establish my authority by being dictatorial or being ruthless,” he said. “I just ask for one thing: respect and commitment. At this level, if I don’t get that I pack my bags and go somewhere else because that is the minimum I can ask for. “I am going to expect that from everybody who works for the club, first of all myself. To be successful you have to be passionate about something and, if you want to represent a club of this size, that is the minimum standard you have to bring. I am not going to ask anybody to put the ball into the top corner every time they hit it, but I will ask them to do the right things every single day for this club.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta admits to ‘cloud’ hanging over Arsenal strikers’ futures,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/mikel-arteta-admits-to-cloud-hanging-over-arsenal-strikers-futures
12/24/2021,"Trying to keep a lid on the hype that surrounds Alfie Barbeary is like swimming against the tide. Wasps’ head coach, Lee Blackett, has done his best – railing at how even before he made his Premiership debut it was considered a matter of when, not if, he toured with the British & Irish Lions – but a hat-trick on his first league start last year, aged 19, blew the lid straight off. He has since been included in England squads – he had been into camp even before that match against Leicester last September – and his raw potential, his eye-catching ball-carrying for someone so young has been evident whenever he has taken the field since. The trouble is, that has happened all too infrequently because Barbeary has been blighted by persistent injuries ever since bursting on to the stage.  Wasps’s last match – the European defeat by Munster this month – was only his seventh start since that hat-trick, and his third appearance of the season, amid syndesmosis near the ankle and hamstring injuries. They have been all the more frustrating because there have been brief comebacks along the way and as Blackett, whose side host London Irish on Boxing Day, recently lamented: “His last two games he’s played in, he’s got injured in the warmup.” Still he has managed to show why he is so highly-rated – he scored within four minutes of coming on against Gloucester in November and he was impressive against Munster before being withdrawn at half-time due to a tight hamstring. His willingness to accept that decision, however, is a sign of his growing maturity. Barbeary has an endearing love for his sport – put simply, he is desperate to be on the field and never happier bulldozing defenders backwards. As far as his recent injury troubles are concerned he has, at times, been his own worst enemy but after a decision was taken, in consultation with Eddie Jones, to permanently relocate from hooker to the back row it feels like the 21-year-old is beginning a new chapter. “I always say centre and a bit fluffy round the edges,” says Barbeary. “Right now I’m going to focus on back-row, that’s where I can do the best for Lee at Wasps. We’ll see what happens but I’m going back-row for the future. I hadn’t really played at hooker for about a year – since before Covid – so I had played more at back-row, was really enjoying it and getting in the team. “And in terms of going back to hooker, there was uncertainty about getting in the team. I spoke to my mum and dad; Dad has always seen me as a back-row. I was enjoying it a lot more, there was more freedom, so I decided to go ahead and stay there. Hopefully it’s the right decision. “[Eddie and I] had a discussion in terms of what I was thinking. But I think it was more my decision more than anything else in terms of where I saw myself and where I wanted to play, rather than his [decision]. It was more about what I was thinking to let him know more than anything else.” If Barbeary comes across as brash in telling Jones how things will be – rather than vice versa – there is roguishness to him that England’s head coach will no doubt embrace. As difficult a decision as it may have been to switch positions, the logic is pretty simple – in the back row Barbeary can get his hands on the ball more and given he can be box office when he does it seems a no-brainer. “I’ve got lots of enjoyment out of my ball-carrying and trying to beat defenders,” he adds. “At hooker it’s a lot harder to get on the ball. At set-piece you’re either throwing into the lineout or in the middle of a scrum, so being in the back row I can be part of that but very easily get on to the ball in terms of second phase. It is just easier for me to get into the game when I get those first few carries but at hooker it could take a while. Back-row flows a bit easier.” It may mean that the England team is that little bit harder to get into but Barbeary demonstrates the maturity that Blackett lauds when assessing whether that came into his thinking. “You look at the back row in England and there are so many talents and it does make you wonder but I know I play my best rugby if I’m in the position I want to play in. I could go all right at hooker but I might not enjoy it as much and that might show in my game play so I thought, ‘I’ve got to do this for me’, and if things happen, things happen.” The key now is keeping the persistent injuries at bay. Barbeary admits he is learning how to better manage his body now and under the tutelage of Joe Launchbury and Jack Willis – both of whom are still out with long-term injuries – he has stuck to his rehab regime. Beneath his lighthearted demeanour is a fierce competitor – someone who would flip the Monopoly board if they were losing, says Blackett – and the penny appears to have dropped that he has to manage his body as well as putting it on the line to such devastating effect. “I’ve never been too keen sat watching in the crowd so you can imagine how much these last eight months have killed me,” Barbeary says. “[But] I’ve just got to keep being positive and if things don’t always go the right way, just remember that we’re lucky to be in this as a job and try and take everything from it. I think Lee and I are similar in terms of how competitive we are. I’m not one who likes losing, I’m not sure anyone is, but it does ruin your weekend when you don’t get a win. I’d say Lee is more the one who flips the board, I’m the one picking up the money after he’s flipped it!”",Sport/Sport,Wasps’ Alfie Barbeary hopes moving back is the way forward,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/wasps-alfie-barbeary-hopes-moving-back-is-the-way-forward
12/24/2021,"The writing of Joan Didion, who has died 87, was mantra-like, mannered, even “set in its own modulations” (that was Martin Amis’s snipe). It was also unique and remarkable. Even the shape of her books was uncommon, the sentences spaced on pages as tall and narrow as king-sized cigarette packets. She had practised that incantatory style since her mother had presented her, aged five, with a notebook and a suggestion that she calm her anxious self by writing. Her family had long been settled in California, then chiefly an agricultural state, a location that mattered to Didion’s story, and to her story-telling.  She was born in Sacramento, the daughter of Eduene (nee Jerrett) and Frank Didion, a finance officer with the US army, poker player, and, after the second world war, a real estate dealer. Joan was an army brat on her father’s stations, and her juvenile fantasies set out in that notebook were doomy – death in the desert, suicide in the surf. The only printed influence on her work she ever cited was Ernest Hemingway, as she had typed out his prose in order to master the keyboard and his syntax: the exact placement of words was the basis of her style as it had been of his. “Grammar is a piano I play by ear,” she claimed. Studying English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, taught her to audit meaning, dissect language and triangulate evidence, and modified her original ambition, acting, into writing as performance. Didion won Vogue’s Prix de Paris contest in 1956, and was rewarded with a copywriter’s job, dogsbodying with proximity to glamour, in New York, rising to associate features editor over eight years at Condé Nast. She said later that she had been in love with the city’s promise, excited by meeting whoever was in town — models, millionaires, magnates — but had remained an exiled westerner not at home in New York. With a portable typewriter perched on a chair in her almost empty apartment, she wrote a novel about the Californian rivers she so missed. Those waterways are the real lead in her first novel, Run River (1963). John Gregory Dunne, a staffer on Time magazine and also a self-declared outsider, edited it. They married in 1964, and moved to Los Angeles temporarily, sure that his older brother, the producer Dominick Dunne, would be their entree to screenwriting. That scenario did not quite play out, and both had to turn to magazine journalism for an income. Didion categorised some of her essays, with their first-person viewpoint and fiction-like fine detail, as “Personals”, but in fact they were about the world as seen by a social and political conservative from the last American generation to identify with adults. A tiny, unnerved and unnerving figure behind vast dark glasses, she was derisive of lax language and dismissive of unformed thought on both the left and right. She did not care to negotiate interviews with stars via their press agents. She believed she could pass unnoticed anywhere: among the residue of the Hollywood studios and the creatives of the new music business; in arid valley towns and LA’s dustier districts; around the coagulating hippy counterculture in San Francisco. Her descriptions of her crippling social anxiety, her inability to make a phone call to get an assignment under way, did not accord with others’ memories of her taking laps of the room at swelegant parties. Didion’s first book of collected journalism, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, published in 1968, the year in which she had a breakdown, established her reputation for cool and very slowly became a cult: as the writer Caitlin Flanagan remembered, Didion “had fans – not the way writers have fans, but the way musicians and actors have fans – and almost all of them were female”. That coolness was confirmed by her second novel, Play It As It Lays (1970), with its zomboid leading woman on Hollywood’s perimeter, so chilled a fiction that Didion’s editor, Henry Robbins, called her to ask if she was all right. Possibly not, but she was getting by. The next year the couple had their first script onscreen, The Panic in Needle Park, and then their 1972 adaptation of Play It As It Lays flopped. Didion’s literary identity became clearer than that of her husband, with whom she shared preoccupations and phrasing, which added edge to their joint 1976 refettling of A Star Is Born to Barbra Streisand’s specifications. Didion continued the essays, more personal yet, collected in 1979 as The White Album, and developed an idea she had had when trapped by paratyphoid in a hotel room during a Columbian film festival into A Book of Common Prayer (1977), her first fictional engagement with the role and image of the US in Central and Latin America. At that point all the elements were in play that recurred in her fact and fiction. There was her concentration on the Americas – she had visited Europe and Israel, but disclaimed interest in them – and on the Hispanic influx into the US, which, as a Californian, she was aware of very early. Her books of reportage, El Salvador (1982) - “One morning at the breakfast table I was reading the newspaper and it just didn’t make sense,” she wrote of US press coverage of Salvador’s internal war, and immediately flew there to inspect the body dumps – and Miami (1987), were descriptions of equal and opposite cultural misunderstandings. She felt that the US political process had become self-contained, exclusive of the electorate and, from the presidency of Ronald Reagan onwards, of reality itself – as depicted in the essays anthologised in After Henry (1992) and Political Fictions (2001) and her occasional 21st century pieces. This perception also fed into her best and most successful novel, Democracy (1984), which could be read as a romance, or – as was also true of her 1996 novel The Last Thing He Wanted – as an exploration of private connections to public power. The political could not have been made more personal. The greater constant in Didion’s work, though, was the intersection of public and private mood with place – Hawaii febrile in tropical rain, Los Angeles fractious as the Santa Ana winds blew through. Readers came to know the homes she had passed through – the Malibu beach premises on the edge of the fire season burn zone, the “house in a part of Hollywood that had once been expensive and was now described as a ‘senseless killing neighbourhood’”, the Manhattan apartment with the Cy Twombly artwork, plus a travel itinerary of grand hotels. They became even more familiar with the older California that she kept recalling all the way up to her memoir Where I Was From (2003), in which she finally admitted that her apprehension of her native state had been a misapprehension, an “enchantment under which I lived my life”. It was not the place she had thought it, and it never had been, all the way back to the settlers’ wagon trains and their encounters with rattlesnakes. By then, she seemed to feel that reality was dispelling all enchantments from her life. The lives of Didion and Dunne had been mostly funded by their remunerative rewrites for the screen, although their joint “implied promise of quality” had been delivered in the adaption of Dunne’s novel True Confessions (1981), and rather less so in a prolonged project, Up Close and Personal, filmed in 1996 as a vehicle for Robert Redford. They supported each other in public over their career compromises, but there had been fights and near-splits in the marriage. They once holidayed in the Royal Hawaian hotel “in lieu of filing for divorce”, and Dunne left to live alone in Vegas for a while when it was his turn for a breakdown. But it had survived, stronger than a mutual defence pact. Dunne died of a heart attack at their dinner table in Manhattan in 2003, a sudden exit that Didion described in The Year of Magical Thinking (2005), her book of grief and disbelief. It was critically admired for its honesty and clarity, and adapted for the stage. Didion delayed Dunne’s funeral until their daughter Quintana had recovered from the pneumonia and septic shock that had put her into hospital intensive care. But her recovery was brief and Quintana died just before the book’s publication. Didion and Dunne had adopted the baby on the day of her birth in 1966, and called her after a Mexican state. She became a familiar player in their pieces, often quoted, described as an insouciant user of hotel room service when accompanying her mother on book tours. In Blue Nights (2011), Didion suggested quite another story of Quintana as a Hollywood child who feared abandonment, was suicidal, diagnosed as manic depressive, and in adulthood had had difficult encounters with her birth family. However, the true subject of Blue Nights was Didion, alone and a long way from California; there could be no going back to places so changed. Her last works, South and West (2017) and Let Me Tell You What I Mean (2021) collected her “field notes” and early writing.

12/24/2021,"At least three arts organisations have pulled out of Sydney festival over a sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy, amid calls for a boycott. The protests, backed by a coalition of Arab and pro-Palestinian organisations and assorted artists and academics, are over a $20,000 sponsorship deal to stage a production of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin’s Decadance by the Sydney Dance Company.  So far, Blake Prize-winning artist Khaled Sabsabi, Malyangapa and Barkindji rapper Barkaa, South Asian dance company Bindi Bosses, the Arab Theatre Studio, the Bankstown poetry slam and comedian Nazeem Hussain have pulled out of the 2022 festival. According to a statement released on Wednesday by the Palestinian Justice Movement Sydney, the sponsorship deal was sealed in May, the same month Israeli armed forces launched a series of air attacks on Gaza, killing a number of Palestinian civilians. “Palestine advocates call on all opponents of apartheid to boycott the 2022 Sydney Festival,” the statement said. “By partnering with Israel, Sydney festival will … contribute to the normalisation of an apartheid state.” Read our media release: Palestine Justice Movement Sydney joins other Palestine solidarity-organisations in calling on audiences and performers to boycott @sydney_festival this January. We're also calling on festival directors to refuse complicity w Israeli apartheid & resign. pic.twitter.com/AquadkgjdY In an open letter published on the Meanjin website on Thursday, a coalition of artists and writers said that they considered the Sydney festival’s continued partnership with the Israeli embassy was “disgraceful” and accused the festival of “creating a culturally unsafe environment for Arab artists and audiences who want to be part of the festival but who now cannot, in good conscience, participate as they bear witness to the slaughter, occupation and oppression of Palestinians”. Naharin has stated on a number of occasions his support in principle for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movements’s agenda on human rights for the Palestinian people. But, responding to request from Brian Eno to cease using his musical works in an Israeli embassy-sponsored Batsheva Dance Company production in Tel Aviv in 2016, the choreographer described such boycotts as “lazy” and “essentially useless”, adding he believed there were more effective ways of helping the Palestinian cause. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia on Thursday, a festival spokesperson said it would not be terminating its agreement with the Israeli embassy. “The festival is unwavering in its commitment to ensuring a culturally safe space for all artists, employees and audiences,” the statement said. “[The festival] will be reviewing all funding arrangements with embassies and cultural organisations to ensure that any continuance of these partnerships are compatible with maintaining a welcoming and culturally safe environment moving forward.” In an earlier statement this week, the Sydney festival board said it was unable to support the BDS movement as requested by the coalition (which includes the Arab Australian Federation, Greens for Palestine, Independent Australian Jewish Voices, Jews against the Occupation Sydney, the Sydney representative for BDS and United Australian Palestinian Workers) because the festival was a nonprofit, non-political organisation. One of the co-authors of the Meanjin letter is writer Michael Mohammed Ahmad, who was due to join the festival board later this year and has now rejected the appointment. The open letter described the festival’s position as “a hollow claim given the Festival is politically aware enough to platform First Nations and ‘minority’ or ‘diverse artists’. “How is it that the festival can reconcile its commitment to Indigenous solidarity here while legitimising and normalising relations with a settler colonial apartheid state that maintains a system of racism, subjugation and land theft against Palestinians?” the letter asked. This is so incredibly disappointing. The arts, particularly for marginalised peoples are (for the most part), our political platforms. For an arts festival to claim they are apolitical is embarrassing to say the very least. Writer and academic Anita Heiss tweeted: “For an arts festival to claim they are apolitical is embarrassing to say the very least.” A statement from the Israel embassy in Canberra sent to the Guardian on Thursday said: “Israel has always and will continue to promote cultural exchange and engage in cultural dialogue in numerous countries including Australia. “Culture is a bridge to coexistence, cooperation and rapprochement and should be left out of the political arena.” Earlier this year the Melbourne Queer film festival faced a similar backlash for screening an Israeli state-funded film.",Arts/Culture,Arts organisations pull out of Sydney festival in protest at Israeli embassy sponsorship,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/24/arts-organisations-pull-out-sydney-festival-protest-israeli-embassy-sponsorship
12/24/2021,"Everyone has a favourite ghost in Ghosts. Mine, in direct opposition to my feelings in the bloodless world of the living, is Julian. Simon Farnaby’s Teflon-coated sleazy Tory (distinguishing feature: no trousers) died mid-shag with an MP called Lindsay during a 90s fundraiser. He is such a blowhard that he is the only ghost in Britain’s friendliest haunted house who can move things – if he concentrates really hard and makes a ridiculous amount of noise. With his pants down. Anyway, Julian is on top form in the Christmas special (BBC One), which is as much of a hot-water bottle for the heart as you would expect it to be. He rails against the rough sleeper who has pitched his tent on Button Hall’s land: “I don’t want to sound all not-in-my-back-yard, but you really don’t want one in your own back yard.” Then he does a U-turn. Which, of course, is really a lie: “I’m no liberal, but ejecting a vagrant at Christmas? I would never, ever stoop so low!”  Most yuletidey of all, Julian teaches the other ghosts how to lie. Who knew that nothing would get me more in the mood for Christmas 2021 than a gentle, family-friendly, completely on-the-nose jibe about dissembling Tories? “There is nothing that can’t be lied about,” he brags, smashing his knuckles into his palm. “Or rather, there is no truth that cannot be avoided.” When lying, Julian concludes, it is best to answer a question with another question. “Does that actually work?” asks Pat whose questions tend more towards the annual Christmas quiz. “Do you want it to work?” Julian bats back. “See!” This is everything you want from a Christmas special. It is funny, festive and features Jennifer Saunders channelling Mrs Bennet as Lady Fanny’s overbearing mother, which is without a shadow of a doubt the most sparkly sentence I have written this season. It is also perfect casting; Martha Howe-Douglas’s Fanny, with her chin-wattling expressions and overstated grandeur, is clearly modelled on vintage French and Saunders sketches. Ghosts, which rose like the dead from Horrible Histories, has always done a fine line in backstories and this one is a doozy. Fanny, it turns out, was a young mathematical genius (check out her yorkshire pudding long division if you don’t believe me) who desperately wanted to help her father escape penury. But her Edwardian mother – Saunders – was more interested in keeping up appearances and marrying her off to the next rich sod. When their house was repossessed at Christmas, Fanny was forced to marry the wayward son of rich cousins the Buttons to save them from the streets. We know how that one turned out, what with her being thrown out of the window by her gay husband and all. My only criticism of this tragic tale? The missed opportunity. Dawn French would have been the perfect bailiff. The old-fashioned – indeed, Christian – message entwined through it all like tinsel is about helping those less fortunate than ourselves. Everyone reacts to the homeless man differently. Alison wants him to stay and microwaves him a cottage pie (which he gives to his dog because “I lost my house, not my tastebuds”). Mike fears he will ruin their “quiet Cooper Christmas” and toys with calling the police. Then we learn his backstory. He is ex-navy (“civilians with fancy hats!” exclaims the Captain), his name is Nicholas, he makes a mean haricot bean stew, he has a dog called Rudy and he wears a red beanie. No wonder Kitty, who is basically festive spirit in the spectral form of a Georgian noble, thinks he is Father Christmas. All she wants for Christmas is a tiny, singing-and-dancing Santa with a saxophone reduced online from £14.99 to £11.24. It is in such pathetic details that Ghosts scales the heady – or should I say headless? – heights. Ghosts is like the best roast potatoes – soft on the inside and Christmassy all year round. Partly, it is the subject matter: ghosts have been festive since Dickens sent one to sort out Ebenezer Scrooge. But it is also the feelings this classic British sitcom – and how many of those do we have at the moment? – induces. Three gloriously silly series in, Ghosts remains hilarious, erudite and sweet, with a gag ratio so high, and of such consistently high quality, that even a joke about lying politicians can make you feel all warm, fuzzy and – sorry, there is no other word for it – irreparably British inside. Yes, I experience curious and long-latent feelings of pride when I watch Ghosts. Indeed, Button Hall may be among the last safe spaces in this country where it is OK to resurrect long-dead feelings of nostalgia (even if it is plagued by ghosts who never shut up).

Snow, whose memorable appearances have ranged from grilling government ministers to reports from war zones, will continue to work with Channel 4 on long-form projects and spend more time focusing on his charitable work.  On Thursday night, in his emotional closing remarks, he paid tribute to his colleagues and the regulators “that have given us an hour of independent news in primetime”. He also praised “all the people who have trusted me with their stories, all over the world, often in appalling circumstances,” and the viewers, saying: “It has been the greatest privilege of my life to bring you the news.” Here is @jonsnowC4's emotional final sign off from @Channel4News pic.twitter.com/5QPkFNbxPe The show closed with him walking through the newsroom saying farewell to colleagues.

Viewers love him. And even those politicians who disagree and get angry with him respect him.” The Channel 4 News correspondent Ciaran Jenkins shared a video of Snow performing a sea shanty that went viral on TikTok earlier this year. “The legendary @jonsnowC4 presents @Channel4News for the last time tonight. A superb journalist, unique communicator and an inspiration to so many of us,” he said. Referencing the lyrics of the shanty, Jenkins added: “‘One day when the tonguing is done we’ll take our leave and go.’ “We’ll miss you so much Jon.” The ITV News presenter Lucrezia Millarini described Snow as a legend, adding: “Wow. A constant on-screen presence in my household growing up. Then I was lucky enough to work in the same building.” Snow, whose father was the bishop of Whitby, started his career in journalism at LBC in 1973 and moved to ITN in 1976, where he served as Washington correspondent and diplomatic editor. He became the main presenter of Channel 4 News in 1989. Channel 4 has previously said Snow will now “focus on his charities and some of his many passions in life, people’s stories, inequality, Africa, Iran and the arts”.

12/24/2021,"Doctors have made an urgent plea to keep Christmas celebrations small as scientists said mounting evidence that the Omicron variant of coronavirus is milder may not be enough to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. In the first government study of its kind, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found that the risk of being admitted to hospital is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared with those infected with Delta.  But the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned ministers that the new variant would have to be about 90% less severe for hospital admissions not to reach previous peak levels, “unless the wave peaks early for other reasons”, according to minutes published on Thursday. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, welcomed the UKHSA findings as “promising” but said cases were rising at an “extraordinary rate” and it was still “too early to determine next steps”. The Scottish government announced on Thursday that nightclubs would close for three weeks from 27 December, the latest in a series of Covid curbs introduced by the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK government has said no further measures in England will be announced before Christmas. Official data on Thursday showed there were 119,789 new Covid infections across the UK in the previous 24 hours – a record number – meaning more than 600,000 people will be in isolation on Christmas Day. A further 147 coronavirus deaths were recorded on Thursday, with daily deaths relatively stable. With millions of Britons now already with their Christmas companions or travelling to spend the weekend with family or friends, Dr Nick Scriven, a past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, told the Guardian: “I personally would advocate caution, especially as the Omicron variant seems so transmissible, even if only for a few days. “What I mean by this is doing lateral flow tests before any gatherings and perhaps limiting the numbers people mix with over the next few days. [And] if you are not fully vaccinated with a booster, I would be very cautious about mixing outside your family circle.” In a pointed reminder of revelations of rule-breaking get-togethers involving Downing Street last Christmas, Scriven, a senior doctor in Yorkshire, said: “We are really relying on people doing what experts suggest and not using politicians as role models.” Dr Andrew Goddard, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, acknowledged that while people may find it hard to avoid being in a large group, they should do so to help limit soaring sickness absence among NHS staff. “While we are all looking forward to time with loved ones this year, we need to think very carefully about the number of people we mix with over the next couple of weeks. That’s not a message people want to hear and not one that’s easy to deliver. But if we aren’t cautious, we risk the number of available health and care staff falling to very dangerous levels,” Goddard said. NHS England data released on Thursday showed that the number of health service staff days lost to Covid in England soared by 38% last week, to 124,855. Hospital bosses privately voiced deep unease that the sharp rise, coming on top of the service’s almost 100,000 vacancies, could hinder its ability to cope with a feared wave of hospitalisations driven by the new variant. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, declared that the NHS was “on a war footing”. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the service was facing “a double emergency” of a growing number of staff off sick at the same time as hospitalisations because of the virus were rising sharply. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, cautioned that despite Omicron being milder, the health service could still come under very serious pressure. “We still don’t have conclusive data in terms of what impact Omicron could have in terms of level of hospitalisations. We have some very early studies, but it’s a bit like trying to predict the result of a football game when you’re only a third of the way through,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The leader of Britain’s family doctors also advised restraint in personal behaviour in the face of Delta and Omicron fuelling a new surge in Covid cases. “Even if vaccinated, it’s important that people behave cautiously while new cases remain high,” said Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs. As well as wearing a mask, washing their hands and practising social distancing, people should be prepared to isolate over Christmas if they test positive in order to not spread Covid to others, he added. According to the UKHSA research, people with Omicron are between 31% and 45% less likely to go to A&E compared with those with Delta, and 50% to 70% less likely to require admission to hospital. The early findings are consistent with analysis published on Wednesday by Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh. Lockdown-sceptic Conservatives have seized on the analysis as fresh evidence to support the idea that more restrictions are unnecessary. “It does look like it’s less severe,” said Mark Harper, the chair of the backbench Covid Recovery Group. “I just don’t buy the idea you’re going to have immense numbers of people in hospital, given that most people have been boosted now. You might want to have some guidance, but I can’t see much of a case for restrictions, to be honest.” Harper was among the 100 Conservative MPs who voted against the introduction of compulsory Covid passes this month. Boris Johnson has promised to recall parliament if he decides stricter rules are needed in the coming days, but he would be likely to face a fierce backlash from his own MPs, including in cabinet. One minister told the Guardian they believed the UKHSA analysis, together with “people’s self-control” and higher immunity from the booster campaign, supported the idea that “draconian” restrictions could be avoided.",News/Society,"Keep Christmas plans small to help NHS fight Omicron, doctors plead",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/keep-christmas-plans-small-to-help-nhs-fight-omicron-doctors-plead
12/24/2021,"Joan Didion inspired writers and readers for decades. Her journalism, memoirs, and cultural and political commentary made her a unique chronicler of 20th-century culture. Here are 23 quotes that encapsulate her writing:  We tell ourselves stories in order to live. – The White Album (1979) Character – the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life – is the source from which self-respect springs. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. – Why I Write (essay originally published in the New York Times Book Review in 1976) To free us from the expectations of others, to give us back to ourselves – there lies the great, singular power of self-respect. – Self-respect: Its Source, Its Power (essay originally published in Vogue in 1961) You have to pick the places you don’t walk away from. – A Book of Common Prayer (1977) The fancy that extraterrestrial life is by definition of a higher order than our own is one that soothes all children, and many writers. – The White Album (1979) [O]ne of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened to anyone before. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) There’s a point when you go with what you’ve got. Or you don’t go. – a The Paris Review interview (1978) I did not always think he was right nor did he always think I was right but we were each the person the other trusted. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005), which explores grief following the death of her husband We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were. – On keeping a notebook, from Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) I know what the fear is. The fear is not for what is lost. What is lost is already in the wall. What is lost is already behind the locked door. The fear is for what is still to be lost. – Blue Nights (2011) There is no real way to deal with everything we lose. — Where I Was From (2003) We are imperfect mortal beings, aware of that mortality even as we push it away, failed by our very complication, so wired that when we mourn our losses we also mourn, for better or for worse, ourselves. As we were. As we are no longer. As we will one day not be at all. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) In time of trouble, I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature. Information was control. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for one’s self depends upon one’s mastery of the language. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) You get the sense that it’s possible simply to go through life noticing things and writing them down and that this is OK, it’s worth doing. That the seemingly insignificant things that most of us spend our days noticing are really significant, have meaning, and tell us something. – The Paris Review interview (2006). Los Angeles weather is the weather of catastrophe, of apocalypse, and, just as the reliably long and bitter winters of New England determine the way life is lived there, so the violence and the unpredictability of the Santa Ana affect the entire quality of life in Los Angeles, accentuate its impermanence, its unreliability. The wind shows us how close to the edge we are. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) New York was no mere city. It was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) A place belongs forever to whoever claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it so radically that he remakes it in his image. – The White Album (1979) I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.” – UC Riverside commencement address (1975). Which are your favourite Didion quotes or books?

In the video shared on social media, three men and a woman gathered outside a gated property and after pressing an electronic buzzer, one of them posted documents into an external letterbox. Anti-vaccination activists routinely share templates of supposed legal documents that they then film themselves depositing. However, a person who lives locally and saw the footage told the PA news agency: “That’s an old address they have for him.” In the video, the man who posted the documents says: “Everyone is going to get this, every celebrity, sick of yous.

Rather than target the BBC’s news operation, which they held responsible for promoting Covid-19 vaccines, a handful of protesters gained access to Television Centre in west London, which is predominantly rented by ITV. In October, anti-jab demonstrators targeted the home of the TV and radio presenter Jeremy Vine and tried to serve what it called an “anti-vaxx writ” while he was out, instead handing it over to his wife.

12/24/2021,"For Steven Bergwijn, it comes down to a single issue, which involves a question for Antonio Conte. Does the Tottenham manager intend to play him? If he does, then Bergwijn would be a happy man – as he was on Wednesday when Conte started him in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against West Ham. The Netherlands winger, who scored one and set up the other for Lucas Moura in Spurs’s 2-1 win, wants to succeed at the club. It is his priority. Not every player can make the step from the Eredivisie to the Premier League and Bergwijn wants to prove that he can do it, having moved from PSV Eindhoven for an initial €30m in January 2020.  It has been a struggle, Bergwijn’s attempts to find his groove not helped by injuries and the club changing the manager three times. The 24-year-old has five goals and nine assists from 63 appearances – not the return that he or anybody had hoped for. But if Conte cannot grant him his minutes for whatever reason – it is too hard to find the room; he does not rate him; he does not trust him – then Bergwijn wants to be allowed to leave in January. It is an open secret that Ajax would take him on loan with an obligation to buy – they tried and failed with a move for him last summer – and clubs from Italy, Spain and Germany have contacted Spurs in recent weeks to inquire about the situation. With the World Cup looming at the end of next year, Bergwijn – who has 16 caps – is under no illusions as to the importance of regular football and the signs, so far, under Conte have not been encouraging. Before the West Ham cup tie, Bergwijn had made two substitute appearances totalling 13 minutes across seven games. He was unavailable for one of them because of illness: the Europa Conference League match at Mura. Bergwijn’s previous start – under Nuno Espírito Santo – had been in the Carabao Cup win at Burnley on 27 October and, while it is lovely to play in the tournament, it is a long way from being enough. To repeat, it is all about the league. His situation is mirrored elsewhere in the Spurs squad – most notably with Joe Rodon, Harry Winks and Dele Alli – and it will provide a litmus test for the club’s managing director of football, Fabio Paratici, in the January transfer window. Conte wants to upgrade the squad, with his biggest wishes being a centre-half and a player for the right flank, and the starting point for Paratici is that sales will be vital to the size of the budget. Conte has always been aware of this. So what can Paratici generate to spark the renewal or, to ask the question a more pertinent way, to what extent can he persuade the chairman, Daniel Levy, to cut his losses in certain areas? Take Bergwijn. He is no longer worth €30m because of the deflationary effect of the pandemic and, more to the point, because he has scored five Spurs goals in two years. It is one thing for Levy to tell clubs to forget about a loan for the player because, as everybody knows, there is next to no value in that for Spurs. A loan with an obligation to buy means that the bulk of any money raised would not be immediately available, which is not ideal and, plainly, a straight sale would be preferable. But it stands to be about compromise, realism – and that takes in the fact buying clubs are working in the same market and under the same constraints. The former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino became frustrated in the summer of 2019 – his last at the club – when outgoing business was slow, with stalemates taking hold and some players sitting on their contracts, their appetite for the project not as great. The dynamics were heavier; things felt clogged. Those who know Paratici describe a pragmatist who will pay more for a player he deems essential. When he was at Juventus, he did so to secure the €100m purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018. Javier Ribalta, who worked alongside Paratici at the club from 2012 to 2017 as head of scouting, noted that when needs must “you cannot lose the player for a few million”. Paratici’s mentality, he said, was to “pay and move on”. It is no great leap to see the approach extending to the sale of players. Can Paratici un-Levy Levy? It could hold the key not only to Bergwijn’s future but Conte’s tenure at Spurs.",Sport/Football,January transfer success for Spurs will need Paratici to un-Levy Daniel Levy ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/january-transfer-success-for-spurs-will-need-paratici-to-un-levy-daniel-levy
12/24/2021,"An absence of deal-making is one reason why Flutter Entertainment, the £20bn gambling conglomerate that encompasses Paddy Power, Betfair, Sky Bet, PokerStars and more, has been one of the worst share price performers in the FTSE 100 index this year. The stock is down by a quarter. Investors had expected the liberalising US market, where Flutter looks well-placed with its FanDuel operation, to deliver the adrenaline rush of highly priced consolidation, but it never quite happened. Two US firms made tentative offers for Entain, the Ladbrokes and Coral operator that is also big stateside, but both pulled back. It may be that the leading global players will have to compete harder with each other in the US, which is a less exciting short-term investment prospect (though probably a better one for American punters).  Still, here comes Flutter with an opportunistic pre-Christmas deal to remind its shareholders that life isn’t all about US excitement. It is paying £1.62bn to buy Italian group Sisal, the country’s leading online gambling operator with a 12% share, which also has a large chain of betting shops and runs regulated lotteries in Italy, Morocco and Turkey. The purchase, says Flutter chief executive Peter Jackson, who loves his podium metaphors, will secure “a gold medal position” in a market that had been near the top of the target list. What he probably means is that it is tricky for outsiders to gain a decent online foothold in Italy because virtually all betting advertising is banned, a set-up that favours incumbents with shops. Naturally, Flutter is having to pay a pretty price – almost eight times Sisal’s expected pre-interest and pre-depreciation earnings of €248m (£211m) this year – but bagging the business before the current owner, private equity firm CVC, could float it looks a sound strategic play. The UK group will be able to inject its undoubtedly slick online expertise. What the purchase of Sisal does not do, one trusts, is signal that Flutter has ambitions to run the UK national lottery. Sisal is pitching for the job, but ownership by a leading UK bookie ought to bring disqualification. This newspaper’s recent revelation of how Sky Vegas, another Flutter operation, offered free “spins” to recovering addicts is fresh in the memory. You don’t get a medal for such mistakes. Keep online casino games and the lottery under separate roofs. Unsurprising Omicron finding of the day: regional infection data is roughly reflected in the decline in restaurant-going. So, within the national fall of 14 percentage points in the number of seated diners in the week ending 20 December, according to the flash figures used by the Office for National Statistics, London was down 18 points and Manchester by eight. The only slight source of consolation was that Manchester diners were (marginally) more numerous than in the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. But it’s not much to cling to.

12/24/2021,"Local authorities will be expected to offer “safe and appropriate” accommodation to thousands of people sleeping rough in England this winter, even where they have restricted eligibility because of immigration status, the government has confirmed. A ministerial letter sent this week instructs councils to offer accommodation and a Covid vaccination to people currently sleeping rough – and makes it clear this includes those living on the streets who have no recourse to public funds.  The move was welcomed by homeless charity Shelter, which said a number of asylum seekers were refused help by some authorities during lockdown last year because they were supposedly ineligible for homelessness assistance. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said the letter “finally” clarified the law and gave councils a clear mandate to provide accommodation for everyone sleeping rough during the current wave of Omicron infections and cold winter weather. A government programme at the start of the pandemic had been designed to halt rough sleeping while the virus was circulating. “Despite the ‘Everyone In’ scheme helping thousands off the streets and undoubtedly saving lives at the start of the pandemic, not everyone was helped,” said Neate. “We know from our own services that overstretched councils were, and are, still turning some people away”. Earlier this year a court ruled in favour of a destitute former asylum seeker, Timon Ncube, who was refused accommodation by Brighton and Hove city council during the pandemic on the grounds that he was not eligible for homelessness help. The court said the council was lawfully able to help him during a public health emergency. Separately, new data mapping the scale of destitution among migrants during the pandemic has found that thousands of people slipped through the safety net provided by the Everyone In scheme during the first 14 months of the pandemic – often because they distrusted government and were afraid to ask for help. The data was compiled by the No Accommodation Network (NACCOM) whose 138 frontline member organisations support destitute asylum seekers, refugees and migrants with no recourse to public funds across the UK. 2,771 people approached NACCOM members due to homelessness between April 2020 and June 2021, despite unprecedented levels of emergency statutory provision during Covid-19. A group of NACCOM community researchers looked at the challenges for homeless migrants during the pandemic. “You are wrestling with need for shelter, but afraid to ask for support as you do not know who you can trust,” they wrote. The research found charities provided a vital help to people who fell through gaps in government support, including 1,886 with no recourse to public funds, 829 who were refused asylum and 564 with refugee status. Another 493 with no recourse to public funds included migrants from the European Economic Area. NACCOM members provided 413,089 nights of accommodation during this period. Bridget Young, NACCOM’s director, said: “No one should have to face homelessness and destitution at any time, but for thousands of people to struggle to access safe accommodation during the Covid-19 crisis, when there was emergency support in place, is truly shocking. “While the government’s emergency support for people experiencing homelessness during Covid-19 was needed and welcomed, our data shows that people still fell through the gaps because of their immigration status, and were put at much greater risk of harm from Covid-19 as a result.” Ewan Roberts of Asylum Link in Merseyside, which helps homeless asylum seekers and others with accommodation, said some of the people they work with are too frightened to access mainstream support. “Evictions resumed in September and are continuing despite the rise in Covid infections,” Roberts said. “We had a client ring late yesterday, in a real panic saying he was being evicted: with the Christmas shutdown in place he potentially will be street homeless and outside any mainstream service”. Lauren Scott, director of Refugees at Home which provides hosts to accommodate homeless asylum seekers, refugees and others, said that she believed the hostile environment was a barrier to people with precarious immigration status seeking support from the government during the pandemic. “Work needs to be done to build up relationships of trust. But it’s hard to establish these relationships while pushing hostile environment policies.” A Government spokesperson said: “Councils should exhaust all options within the law to support those unable to access statutory homelessness assistance as a result of their immigration status. As well as working with voluntary partners, this should also include having the power to accommodate rough sleepers in a public emergency – such as if there is a risk to life. “The Everyone In scheme launched during the pandemic has helped 37,000 vulnerable people, including those not from the UK, and we are providing £2bn over the next three years and £800m this year to tackle rough sleeping and homelessness.”",News/Society,Councils told to offer ‘safe and appropriate’ home to anyone sleeping rough,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/migrant-rough-sleepers-in-england-will-be-housed-over-winter-says-government
12/24/2021,"The jury in the manslaughter trial of former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter, who shot dead 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in April 2021, has found her guilty. The former police officer, who is white, had maintained that she made a tragic mistake when she grabbed her gun, instead of her Taser, and shot Wright, who was Black, when he was pulled over while driving in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center.  But on Thursday the jury found Potter guilty of both of the charges she faced, of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter. Potter’s bail was revoked and she was led from court in handcuffs. Sentencing is due on 8 March. Shouts of “justice” rang out outside the courthouse in Minneapolis on Thursday afternoon as protesters who had braved freezing temperatures for days awaiting the outcome praised the verdict. Almost two hours after the conviction, Daunte’s parents, Katie and Aubrey Wright, who had sat holding hands and gulping in deep breaths as they waited for the jury’s pronouncement, emerged, accompanied by Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison, who led the prosecution of the case. Aubrey Wright began to speak, as if to thank prosecutors, but choked up after two or three words and fell silent. Katie Wright described how she “sort of let out a yelp” when the verdict came down. Asked by reporters how she felt, she added: “That moment that I heard guilty on manslaughter one [in the first degree] – every single emotion that you could imagine running through your body.” Ellison pointed out how there would be “an empty chair” at the dinner table of Daunte’s family over the holidays, after the loss of the 20-year-old, who also had a baby son called Daunte Jr. Ellison said the young man had had his whole life ahead of him and was proud to be a new father and loved his mother and siblings and “his whole beautiful family”. The attorney general chose to describe the verdict as “a degree of accountability”, rather than justice, because a life lost could not be brought back. But demonstrators outside the courthouse, braced for the possibility of yet another acquittal after a fatal police shooting, became celebratory, with a brass band showing up and a man playing When the saints come marching in on a trombone as people danced. Wright was killed while the trial was going on, in the same Minneapolis of court house where Potter was just convicted, of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who was accused and later convicted of murdering George Floyd in May 2020, sparking the biggest anti-racism uprising in the US since the civil rights movement. Floyd’s death had become a symbol for the estimated hundreds of people killed by police in Minnesota and the wider US, and eventually for racially biased policing around the world. The sudden and violent killing of Wright in the middle of that trial ramped up tension and grieving in local communities. Unlike Chauvin’s drawn-out torture of Floyd as he died, Potter was seen on body-camera footage shocked and traumatized after killing Wright with a single shot. After shouting “Taser, Taser, Taser”, while she trained a new officer and was accompanied at the traffic stop by another officer, Potter fired at Wright, but it was her gun she was holding. She apologized while appearing on the stand as the final trial witness, testifying in her own defense, but prosecutors accused her of a “blunder of epic proportions” in Wright’s death and said a mistake was no defense, and that she was a highly-trained officer schooled in the use of both stun gun and firearm, and avoiding mix-ups. Prosecutor Erin Eldridge called Wright’s death “entirely preventable. Totally avoidable.” Potter’s attorney, Earl Gray, argued that Wright was to blame for trying to flee from police, after he tried to get back into the car to drive away as the rookie officer Potter was training was about to handcuff him. Wright’s killing prompted angry but non-violent protesters to gather in Brooklyn Center demanding justice. Demonstrator and mother Bethany Hemrich told the Guardian at the time: “They didn’t have to kill him. I feel like if it was a white person, they wouldn’t have shot him.” On Thursday afternoon, one demonstrator outside court told CNN, without disclosing her name, that “the world has changed” since Floyd’s murder. “The world can change for the better, for us Black people, I have a Black son growing up in this world,” she said, adding that it was tough to live wondering “who is the next man who is going to be killed?”",News/US news,Kim Potter found guilty over killing of Daunte Wright,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/kim-potter-trial-guilty-verdict-daunte-wright
12/24/2021,"The Women’s Championship club Coventry United have announced they are going into voluntary liquidation, halfway through their first season as a fully professional club. Coventry, second bottom of the second tier, confirmed the news hours after one player tweeted that they were heartbroken to discover they no longer had a job. The club’s website lists a squad of 21 players and coaches and other staff will also be affected.  “With regret the board of directors have instructed BK Plus Limited to assist with placing the company/club into creditors voluntary liquidation,” a club statement said. “At this point we cannot go into detail … We would like to thank everyone for the support over the last seven years. The club will keep you updated on developments of the club’s future.” The Coventry and Wales goalkeeper Olivia Clark tweeted: “I have no words. To come into work and to find out that you no longer have the job that you’ve always dreamed of is heartbreaking. Thanks for making me a professional footballer and for the best 2 seasons.” Her teammate Holly Chandler echoed those sentiments. “Sometimes life is filled with things outside your control! I’m heartbroken,” she wrote. Coventry, in their third season in the Championship, were next due to play on 9 January against Bristol City. The Football Association, which allows clubs to participate in the Women’s Super League and Championship only if they meet licensing criteria, said: “We are liaising with all relevant parties. Our priority right now is to gain as much information as possible to ensure we can provide the right support to those associated with the club.” The FA’s owners’ and directors’ test applies to Championship clubs. Under the governing bodies rules, Coventry’s results will be expunged if they cease to operate. The Manchester City Women and England defender Alex Greenwood tweeted: “The sacrifices these girls make to become professional footballers to be told halfway through a season you no longer have a job, or a club, is simply not good enough.”",Sport/Football,Women’s Championship club Coventry United going into voluntary liquidation,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/coventry-united-womens-championship-voluntary-liquidation
12/24/2021,"Energy bosses are dialling up the pressure on ministers to shield consumers from soaring gas and electricity bills, with calls on the government to set up a multibillion-pound scheme to help spread the cost to households over a number of years. Amid warnings that energy bills could rise by 50% next year, triggering a “national crisis”, suppliers such as EDF have called on the Treasury to follow other European countries by cutting VAT and green levies to bring down bills.  One idea gaining traction within the industry, including at the trade body Energy UK, involves a government-administered scheme to smooth the impact across multiple years so that consumers aren’t hit all at once. Under plans sketched out by energy suppliers, one or more commercial lenders – such as banks – would cover the immediate cost that they are incurring to buy energy on wholesale markets at record prices, with a sum of at least £7bn required. The loans would not require a government guarantee, but officials would be responsible for ensuring repayments. Fans of the plan believe this could avert the need to pass on the huge increase in gas prices with an immediate hike in the energy price cap that limits what suppliers can charge bill payers. The cap is forecast to rise from £1,277 to nearly £2,000 in April without intervention. With lenders shouldering the upfront cost of wholesale energy prices, suppliers would then be able to stagger tariff increases across multiple years, repaying the lenders through an industry-wide scheme overseen by the government. Ministers and officials are understood to be considering the proposal. One industry chief executive told the Guardian this would avoid extra spending or loan guarantees from the Treasury. “The mechanism could be funded by industry, the government would just need to make sure everyone paid back their part of it and that there were no free riders,” he said. “It just needs enforcement. We need to make sure we don’t slam households with all the costs in the single year.” Dan Alchin, the deputy director of retail at Energy UK, said the plan was among a number of options that could help ease the crisis. “Italy has stepped in and helped suppliers through loan facilities to spread increases out over longer periods of time,” he said. “We’re still working through how this could work in practice but that’s one way it could be facilitated. You don’t hit people with price increases all at once, you spread it out. “We need government to be thinking about these sorts of options and to take action to mitigate the worst impacts.” On Thursday the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the £600 expected rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up next year. Since 1 October, the cap – set by the industry regulator Ofgem – has been set at a record £1,277. It is due to change on 1 April when Ofgem is expected to raise it significantly, prompting predictions that the cap will hit £2,000 in 2022. One industry source said bills would be closer to £3,000 if energy suppliers were able to pass on the full cost of gas prices. “As it is, the price cap is hugely limiting the impact on households,” he said. “That’s a dam that will burst at some point. You can only hold the pressure for so long.” He said scrapping green levies and VAT “wouldn’t touch the sides” but that an industry-wide loan facility could have a larger impact. “We’ll still have to pay it but we’re not trying to pay off a one-in-30-year event in a single year.” EDF, the UK’s fourth biggest energy supplier, said the situation was “critical” and the government must “act now to support energy customers”. Philippe Commaret, the managing director for customers at EDF Energy, said that by next October the UK’s energy price cap “could easily exceed £2,000”. A government spokesperson said: “The energy price cap is insulating millions of customers from record increases in global gas prices and will remain in place, and at the same rate, this winter. We continue to support those most in need through our £500m household support fund, the warm home discount and winter fuel payments.”",News/Business,Ministers under pressure to protect consumers from energy price crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/ministers-under-pressure-to-protect-consumers-from-energy-price-crisis
12/24/2021,"The government has announced that the long-awaited Afghan citizens resettlement scheme will start in January 2022.  The programme will provide support for up to 20,000 Afghans, prioritising women, children and others at risk. The government says those who stood up for women’s rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law will also be prioritised under the scheme. It added that some of those already evacuated, including women’s rights activists, journalists and prosecutors, will be the first to be resettled under the scheme and will be granted indefinite leave to remain, which gives them the right to work and study. Those who worked for the British Council and the security firm Gardaworld, and alumni of the Chevening scholarship programme, will also be considered for resettlement. However, charities working with refugees have asked the government to provide more clarity about how the scheme will work. Louise Calvey, head of services and safeguarding at Refugee Action, said: “It’s vital for the thousands of Afghans stuck in hotels in the UK and the thousands more in fear of their lives in and around Afghanistan that the resettlement programme starts immediately and is properly funded. Yet ministers remain concerningly tight-lipped on crucial details, such as how many of the 20,000 people they’ve pledged to help are already in the UK, and how many additional refugees stuck overseas will be welcomed. “The government must also provide urgent clarity on how it intends to back local councils and international organisations to make sure people fleeing the Taliban quickly receive the life-saving protection and support they desperately need.” A British Red Cross spokesperson said: “We welcome the news that the UK government is set to open the resettlement programme that was promised to people within Afghanistan who need protection. “We know that resettlement programmes can be lifelines for people fleeing persecution and violence, especially when the right support is in place when they arrive in the UK. Our experience supporting a previous programme – for people from Syria – is that for these schemes to work well it has to be a real partnership between national and local government, charities like our own, but also the communities themselves, who play a vital role in welcoming those who seek safety here. “When that’s in place, the benefit [for] people affected by the crisis and the communities that welcome them is huge. We look forward to hearing more about the plan and how this will work in practice.”",News/UK news,UK will start resettling at-risk Afghans in January,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/uk-will-start-resettling-at-risk-afghans-in-january
12/24/2021,"Postal delivery deadlines have well and truly passed, and the window of time for a last-minute gift run has just about shut. Add rising Covid-19 cases to the mix, and a hasty trip to the mall on 24 December feels very much like panic buying.  While browsing for digital presents is something we “often don’t consider” because of “the tradition of having something physically wrapped up,” professor in consumer behaviour from Queensland University of Technology, Gary Mortimer, says the pool of virtual gifting options has dramatically deepened. “Being able to sit quietly one evening and go through a whole range of virtual gifts and experiences for loved ones certainly mitigates the stress of having to battle busy shopping centres,” he says. “I actually give a lot of virtual presents to my friends and family,” says Yulia Saf, blogger behind Miss Tourist, who spends much of her time travelling. “I do not think it ever feels like a last minute, ‘I-didn’t-have-time-to-buy-you-a-real-present’ present.” She says it is “really important” to consider what the person likes. Then it’s a matter of searching the web for “virtual gifts by interest”. Once you’ve found something that works, gifting it digitally is easy. There’s an app store pre-installed on most smartphones, and while most people use the store to download purchases on their own devices, you can also buy an app as a gift for someone else through them. Here’s how. On an Apple iOS device – like an iPhone or iPad – start by browsing the store for the app you’d like to gift. Once you’ve found what you want, tap the app to arrive at its detail page. There, you should see a rectangle with an arrow pointing up; that’s the action button. Tap it, and scroll through the pop-up menu until you see the “Gift App” option, then select it. From there, follow the directions to send the app as a gift, which will involve entering the contact details and a message for your recipient, setting a delivery date, and choosing a visual theme for your gift presentation. If you’re an Android user, Google Play doesn’t offer the same gifting service. But don’t worry, there is a workaround. In the Google Play Store app, tap on the Menu button. From there, select “Send gift”. Google Play allows you to gift credit for an app, rather than gifting an individual app alone. You’ll be able to enter the amount you would like to gift, and follow onscreen instructions to deliver that credit to your recipient. From Netflix to Spotify, Audible, and Amazon Prime, many online streaming services and subscriptions can be sent as gifts. For most, you can find a dedicated gifting page built into a streaming product’s website. But before you buy, Andrew Zeng, digital marketer and e-commerce expert, urges you to “read the fine print”. “Many platforms will only allow you to gift a subscription to new users,” he says. The Disney+ one-year gift subscription, for instance, cannot be added to a recipient’s existing subscription. Other services do “allow gifting additional months to pre-existing users”. Just be sure to double check the terms of the gift before you place your order. Mortimer also suggests perusing virtual travel experiences. “As a result of the pandemic, we saw a lot of travel agencies doing virtual tours of places,” he says. “Jordan, Petra, all the places you’d love to get to, but can’t.” Airbnb offers virtual experiences, from trip planning sessions to tours of famous movie sets; closer to home, Indigenous travel site Welcome to Country also has digital travel sessions on offer. Zeng’s personal favourite digital present is the gift of an online class. “A friend of mine gifted an online course subscription recently, around photography and branding, as I continue to grow my business,” he says. “I found it extremely thoughtful and endearing.” You aren’t limited to sending your gift to its recipient in a trite email with a link and activation code. Saf says there are plenty of ways to make giving the gift more fun. An easy option that will personalise the gift is a video. “Just record a simple, short video of yourself with a personal message,” Zeng suggests. “As if you were to give the gift in person.” Saf also says using video can be a helpful way to teach a not-so-tech-savvy recipient how to activate their virtual gift. She recommends using Loom video, which supports recording your screen and face simultaneously. For the camera-shy, Zeng suggests pairing your virtual gift with an e-card. Easy to find for free online, some e-card sites offer digital versions of classic printed cards, featuring quirky quotes and designs you’d pick up from the local news agency. Others offer animated video cards. Both are a ribbon on top of your virtual gift which you can upload into an email and shoot over to the recipient instantly. Finally, beyond the apps, subscriptions, vouchers and e-cards, Zeng recommends gifting custom digital art. “You could use a marketplace like Etsy, find an artist and have them hand draw a self-portrait, or something of significance,” he says. “It’s all about personalisation when it comes to virtual gifts, that makes it extra special.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘Certainly mitigates the stress’: how to give someone an app, subscription or other virtual gift",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/24/certainly-mitigates-the-stress-how-to-give-someone-an-app-subscription-or-other-virtual-gift
12/24/2021,"More than 35,000 British retailers and 20,000 bars and restaurants are facing significant financial distress, according to new data, while shoppers are forecast to spend almost a quarter less in physical stores this Boxing Day than before the pandemic. If fashion and footwear shops, furniture businesses and other “non-essential” retailers are allowed to remain open from 26 December, £3.94bn is expected to be spent in stores and online that day, 10% less than before the pandemic and 1% lower than last year.  Spending in physical stores alone is expected to fall by 23% compared with 2019 as many shoppers avoid high streets, shopping centres and retail parks amid fears over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. The forecast for the whole post-Christmas week is not much brighter, according to a report by GlobalData for Vouchercodes. A total of £13.9bn is expected to be spent between 25 and 31 December, down 9% on 2019 and up just 1% on 2020 when many high streets were in lockdown. Online retailers will be the big winners, with over £1bn expected to be spent on Christmas Day alone as shoppers snap up bargains while digesting their festive meals. Angus Drummond, a director at VoucherCodes, said fears of a lockdown had pushed shoppers to buy before Christmas rather than waiting for discounts, a trend that he said would “negatively impact the performance of Boxing Day sales”. Meanwhile, data released by the insolvency firm Begbies Traynor revealed the parlous financial position of 55,000 retailers, bars and restaurants across the UK amid reduced footfall and cancellations during a key trading period. The figure represents an improvement on the same quarter of 2020, but a 2% rise in retailers facing financial difficulty versus the period between July and September, as inflation and supply issues continue to bite. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “While many bars, restaurants and hotels have flourished since the summer as the UK has reopened … many now face the prospect of trading through what is typically the leanest part of the year with the double whammy of falling trade and very limited government support.” The disappointing sales for the post-Christmas week are likely to pile pressure on businesses that have suffered because of the pandemic and months of high street lockdowns. Cancelled holidays, parties, weddings and other events have also put a dampener on clothing sales, which account for a large chunk of the retail market. City centres appear to have been hit particularly hard by advice to work from home and nervousness about sharing public transport. Data from the retail intelligence firm Springboard on Wednesday showed a 17.3% drop in footfall in central London compared with the same day last week, and regional cities have recorded a 3.4% drop. Ailing finances could lead to a wave of business failures around the latest quarterly rent day, on Christmas Eve. Creditors often step in to secure their cash before the rental bill payouts at a time of the year when businesses are likely to be more flush with cash because of festive spending. Often administrators are not called in until the new year, however, as many leases have a “Santa clause”, which gives leeway on rent payment until after the Christmas holiday. Retailers have not been included in the government’s latest £1bn bailout package, which focused support on hospitality and leisure businesses. Hospitality businesses say that up to £6,000 in grants for each outlet is not enough to make up for lost takings.",News/Business,Dismal post-Christmas forecast for Omicron-hit high streets in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/post-christmas-forecast-omicron-covid-high-streets-uk
12/24/2021,"Stella McCartney took a near £2.7m salary from her fashion company last year, up more than £220,000 on the year before, while the business claimed almost £850,000 in support from the government’s furlough scheme. The designer’s pay went up despite a 26% fall in sales to £28.4m in the year to 31 December 2020, as sales in the UK more than halved, while the company recorded a pre-tax loss of £31.4m, according to accounts for Stella McCartney Limited filed at Companies House. The group made a £33.4m pretax loss the year before.  The accounts show McCartney’s label, in which she sold a minority stake to the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH in 2019, said it was dependent on additional funds being provided by its new shareholder in order to remain a going concern. LVMH, which owns a suite of high-end brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, had already provided additional loans of £26.3m last year, taking its total lending to the group to just over £66m. Stella McCartney Limited said the directors of Anin Star Holding, LVMH’s investment vehicle, had “indicated their intention to continue to make available such funds are needed by the company” but there could be no certainty that support would continue. The London-based fashion company, which prides itself on its environmental and ethical credentials, said its aim for 2021 was to increase sales by 4% and “significantly reduce” losses. However, the business is likely to have continued to be affected by further high street lockdowns and limits on socialising imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. LVMH bought into McCartney’s label in 2019 just over a year after she ended her 17-year business partnership with its rival conglomerate Kering, and bought back its 50% stake in her brand. McCartney, the daughter of the former Beatle Sir Paul and the late photographer and animal rights activist Linda, designed her first jacket as a teenager. After work experience at Christian Lacroix she rose to become the creative director of the Parisian fashion house Chloé, before starting her own label in a joint venture with Kering, the owner of Gucci, in 2001. A spokesperson for Stella McCartney Limited said: “During the lockdown senior management including Stella took a salary reduction. The 2020 accounts relate to a year of transition and the effects of the pandemic on the retail sector, yet given these challenges the brands sales have remained strong. “In common with all companies within our sector, we are currently dealing with one of the most challenging periods faced by a generation, and are conducting a review in order to adapt our business to the changing economics of our industry. “Our mission to end animal cruelty and to help embed sustainability as core principles in corporate conduct has delivered real progress. We are confident we can emerge stronger and better equipped to continue the vital work towards a more sustainable future for all.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Stella McCartney got pay rise while fashion firm took furlough cash,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/23/stella-mccartney-got-pay-rise-as-fashion-firm-took-furlough-cash
12/24/2021,"The risk of being admitted to hospital is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta, according to the first UK government study of its kind. People with Omicron are estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to go to A&E compared with those with Delta, and 50% to 70% less likely to require admission to hospital, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The early findings, described as “encouraging” and “promising”, are consistent with analysis published on Wednesday by Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh.  However, health leaders also warned that cases in the UK continued to increase at an “extraordinary rate” and that the sheer numbers of people becoming infected could still result in a significant number of people becoming seriously ill, and the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) told ministers that Omicron would have to be about 90% less severe than Delta for hospital admissions not to reach previous peak levels “unless the wave peaks early for other reasons”, according to minutes published on Thursday. Scientists and health officials remained concerned that any benefit of Omicron being milder could be wiped out by large numbers of people becoming infected. The UKHSA said the new variant was more transmissible than previous ones such as Delta, and could still lead to significant numbers of people needing hospital treatment over the coming weeks. At the same time, the preliminary UKHSA data suggests that protection against Covid starts to wane 10 weeks after a booster jab, raising the prospect that a fourth dose of vaccine may be required for some in 2022. It has already been established that protection against symptomatic disease wanes after a second dose of vaccine, and then improves after a booster. However, the new UKHSA data suggests this extra protection starts to decrease more rapidly against Omicron than Delta, being about 15% to 25% lower from 10 weeks after the booster dose. Health officials stressed that although there were insufficient numbers of severe cases of Omicron yet to analyse vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, this was more likely to be sustained, particularly after a booster. One official said the “vast majority” of over-60s received their booster between eight and 10 weeks ago. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the body that would decide on whether a fourth dose is required, has begun assessing the UKHSA data. One health official suggested that a first dose of a new vaccine specially targeted at Omicron might be a better option than a fourth dose of the same vaccine. The new data emerged after the UK experienced yet another record-breaking number of daily reported Covid cases, with 119,789 reported as of 9am on Thursday. The UKHSA said Omicron now accounted for 76% of Covid cases in England, making it the dominant variant. The areas with the highest rates of Omicron are London (90.2%) and the east of England (80%), while the lowest are the north-east (56.8%) and Yorkshire and Humber (71%). Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UKHSA, said: “Our latest analysis shows an encouraging early signal that people who contract the Omicron variant may be at a relatively lower risk of hospitalisation than those who contract other variants. However, it should be noted both that this is early data and more research is required to confirm these findings. “Cases are currently very high in the UK, and even a relatively low proportion requiring hospitalisation could result in a significant number of people becoming seriously ill. The best way that you can protect yourself is to come forward for your first two doses of vaccine, or your booster jab and do everything you can to stop onward transmission of the infection.” The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “This new UKHSA data on Omicron is promising – while two doses of the vaccine aren’t enough, we know boosters offer significant protection against the variant and early evidence suggests this strain may be less severe than Delta. “However, cases of the variant continue to rise at an extraordinary rate – already surpassing the record daily number in the pandemic. Hospital admissions are increasing, and we cannot risk the NHS being overwhelmed.”",News/World news,"Hospital admission risk up to 70% less with Omicron than Delta, UKHSA finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/hospital-admission-risk-up-to-70-less-with-omicron-than-delta-ukhsa-finds
12/24/2021,"Spending time with family matters enormously to human beings. There was a spectacular reminder of that truth this week. DNA from the bones and teeth of 35 people who were buried more than 5,700 years ago in a neolithic tomb in the Cotswolds showed that, fully 700 years before work began on Stonehenge, 27 of the 35 were biological relatives from five generations, including small children. The realities of neolithic life are mostly unimaginable to us today. In their care for family, on the other hand, these otherwise distant communities seem vividly relatable. What was true in prehistory is also true now. This weekend will be its annual embodiment. For most people, the Christmas holiday is the pre-eminent family occasion of the year. Its religious significance has long been secondary to its social importance. For both good and ill, this is a family time. There will be many lonely and hungry people this weekend, and there is invariably a frightening spike in domestic violence. Yet, in spite of Covid curbs, the spread of Omicron and disruptions on road and rail, around half of Britain’s population still plans to visit relatives.  After the enforced isolation of Christmas 2020, this is no surprise. But, simultaneously, it is hardly a shock that greater caution than normal abounds in people’s shopping, socialising and travel behaviours. This year has been very different from the typical pre-pandemic Christmas, partly because so many staff in all parts of the economy have gone down with Omicron, but also because the combined effect of the past 20 months and the new variant’s high transmissibility means that the public is rightly cautious. The possibility of a renewed lockdown and a repetition of the last-minute disruption of 12 months ago has added to the collective restraint. The impact on some sectors of the economy has been devastating. It is a huge relief that Christmas is going ahead across the whole of Britain. Individuals need their break. So do families, communities and nations. The pressure on children has been damaging. The stress for elderly people is particularly palpable. Yet the holiday go-ahead has been a close-run thing. News that there will be no further announcements of new Covid rules in England was only confirmed by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, less than two days before the holiday. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have all been compelled to tweak and tighten their post-Christmas arrangements right up to the last moment. Future restrictions remain very possible. Any idea that all this is a political triumph for Boris Johnson is untrue. In the context of his past mishandling and rule-breaking, and the human losses that have flowed from his approach, the suggestion is immoral. Politically, Mr Johnson has been desperate for Christmas to go ahead, partly because he is a hedonist, partly to avoid a repetition of 2020, partly because it is a tabloid campaigning issue, but also because an intimidatingly large part of his party is recklessly opposed to any restrictions at all. Even Mr Johnson knows that the real issue here is whether, and to what extent, the economy and society can be kept going without the NHS buckling under the strain. Much of his party does not care. In this context, the possibility that the impact of Omicron on individuals may be less severe than feared is good news, if confirmed, but it is not a vindication of Mr Johnson’s handling of the pandemic. If a large section of the Tory party had had its libertarian way, Britain’s record infections, deaths and hospitalisation tallies would be larger still. It is great that the Christmas holiday is here, but the credit for that belongs to the good sense of the majority of the British public, not to the folly of their incompetent and divided government.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Christmas break: no thanks to Boris Johnson | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-christmas-break-no-thanks-to-boris-johnson
12/24/2021,"Virginia Woolf pinned it to “on or about” December 1910: the date at which human nature changed. “All human relations have shifted,” she wrote. “And when human relations change there is at the same time a change in religion, conduct, politics, and literature.” With less hyperbole, we might suggest that it was in the late 1950s that Black America transformed – not just with the civil rights movement, but across the whole spectrum of creativity and conduct. Aspects of this revolution have been well documented: the Birth of the Cool in jazz; the writers Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Richard Wright. But some of the most quotidian parts have gone underexamined. Such as clothes. Look at photos of Black American men in the 1950s and 1960s and what stands out is a coherence and growing confidence in their appearance. Here is the saxophonist John Coltrane in a soft-shouldered jacket and knitted tie, while over here is the writer Amiri Baraka in a button-down shirt and a shawl-collar cardigan. The look is smart, yet relaxed – no heavily padded suits or repp striped ties here. As the varsity jackets and penny loafers suggest, it is a style inspired by privileged white students at Ivy League colleges. You might even say it has been appropriated – and then bettered. The colour palette widens, the finishing touches are bolder: tie clips, collar pins, capped brogues. Later, this look will become known as Black Ivy.  This insurgency is documented and celebrated in a new book called Black Ivy: A Revolt in Style. In his introduction, Jason Jules describes the look as “a kind of battledress, a symbolic armour worn in the nonviolent pursuit of fundamental change. Making society treat them differently meant making the mainstream see them differently first.” Think of the tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins in a button-down shirt playing Freedom Suite, or Billy Taylor in a tweed jacket composing I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free. The goal wasn’t merely to join the elite, it was to redefine it. However subtly done, the style was a challenge to authority. Dressing like a university student wasn’t an affectation, but a crucial part of the struggles around desegregating America’s education system. After the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, the political mood changed – and so did street style. Stokely Carmichael went from working alongside John Lewis in sports jackets and ties to leading the Black Panthers in dark glasses and a black leather jacket, clutching a rifle. While the term “gesture politics” is always intended as an insult, we are right now rewriting what counts as a political gesture: just consider the rows both here and in the US over the taking of the knee. Historians have long argued that enslaved people and indentured labourers showed resistance by dragging their feet or feigning incomprehension of barked orders. Something similar needs to happen with fashion, which is too often discussed as either catwalk creations or what’s in the January sales. Yet it can also be about expressing one’s self-image and beliefs. Black Ivy was about young Black Americans changing how they saw themselves – starting with the mirror by the wardrobe.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on fashion in politics: how to rewrite the style guide | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-fashion-in-politics-how-to-rewrite-the-style-guide
12/24/2021,"More than 600,000 people will be forced to isolate with Covid across the UK on Christmas Day after a record 119,789 tested positive, the highest daily figure since the pandemic began. The surge triggered by the Omicron variant means that 608,000 people who have had Covid confirmed since 18 December in England and 15 December in the rest of the UK will still be in their isolation period on 25 December, Guardian analysis shows.  If daily cases remain high or rise further, in the region of 750,000 people could be barred from leaving their homes to see relatives, take a Christmas Day walk or work in vital services such as the NHS. New guidance for England issued on Wednesday cut the isolation period from 10 to seven days for those who get the all-clear from lateral flow tests. It remains at 10 days for the rest of the UK. The record 119,789 cases for the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday represents a 139% rise on the 50,023 new cases recorded two weeks ago and a 53% week-on-week increase. Wednesday was the first time the UK recorded more than 100,000 Covid cases, with Omicron the most transmissible variant so far. A further 147 people died of Covid-related causes, taking the overall number of people in the UK with Covid on their death certificate to 171,801, the seventh highest in the world. The number of daily deaths remains relatively stable. Daily hospitalisations jumped to 1,004, up from 813 the previous day and a 4.4% rise this week compared with the previous seven days. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Thursday that the risk of being admitted to hospital was up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared with those infected with the Delta variant. Concerns have been raised, however, about the impact of high case rates on staff numbers in sectors such as health, transport and retail. NHS England’s national medical director, Stephen Powis, said the health service was “on a war footing and staff are taking the fight to Omicron”. The number of staff days lost to Covid across NHS England hit 124,855 last week, a 38% jump from 90,277 the week before. “We are once again ramping up to deal with the rise in Covid infections and, quite rightly, staff are making every possible preparation for the uncertain challenges of Omicron,” Powis said. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said ministers would not announce any further restrictions in England before Christmas. His comments came after days of leaks and speculation about whether Boris Johnson would impose measures after Christmas. “We can’t rule out any further measures after Christmas” with Omicron moving at an unprecedented pace, the prime minister said on Tuesday. The number of people in London hospitals also reached its highest level since 27 February, figures from NHS England show, with 2,097 people as of 8am on Thursday. Across England as a whole there are 7,080 patients in hospital with Covid, compared with a peak on 18 January of 34,336. Another 16,817 cases of the Omicron strain were detected after sequencing in the past 24 hours, the UKHSA said, taking the country’s tally to 90,906. The majority of PCR tests are not sequenced, meaning the actual number is likely to be significantly higher.",News/World news,"Covid forces more than 600,000 people in UK into Christmas Day isolation",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/uk-records-119789-new-covid-cases-in-one-day-its-highest-total-ever
12/24/2021,"The chair of West Suffolk hospital trust has resigned over a whistleblowing scandal exposed by the Guardian, as fresh questions are asked over why the trust continues to pay at least £270,000 a year to its former chief executive. Sheila Childerhouse was criticised by an independent NHS report for her failure to question senior executives who had hounded Dr Patricia Mills after Mills had raised concerns about a colleague seen injecting himself with drugs while on duty.  Childerhouse has announced that she will step down in January after consultants at the Bury St Edmunds hospital told her last week that her position was “untenable”. The NHS report, by Christine Outram, found that Childerhouse failed to take up Mills’ concerns when she was sent a “confidential” email in 2018 expressing alarm that the self-injecting doctor was being allowed to continue to treat patients. When the email was passed to the chief executive, Steve Dunn, Mills was accused of trouble-making, libelling the doctor and trying to undermine the hospital’s medical director, Nick Jenkins. In the report Childerhouse was also criticised for failing to question the “extremely ill-judged” decision by executives to demand fingerprint samples from Mills and others as part of a hunt for an anonymous letter writer who alerted a grieving family to a potentially botched operation. In her resignation statement, Childerhouse said: “I recognise and take personal accountability for the failings identified in the independent review into whistleblowing, and believe it is in the best interests of the organisation, our staff, patients and community that I do.” It is understood that Childerhouse had wanted to retain Dunn, described by the former health secretary Matt Hancock as a “brilliant leader”, as chief executive. She accepted Dunn had to go only in June, when two newly appointed non-executive directors resigned over the issue. Dunn was also roundly criticised in the report. As part of his leaving deal, the trust agreed to continue to pay Dunn’s salary and perks, between £270,000 and £275,000 last year, according to the trust’s accounts, while he was on secondment to the Nuffield trust thinktank. Mills said doctors were alarmed to discover the terms of the deal. She said: “We were all really surprised to find out that Steve Dunn is in fact still employed by West Suffolk and will be until September 2022. That fact was opaque in the communication that came out when he left in July.” Separately, the trust has disclosed to Mills, under freedom of information rules, that it paid a private company, Vista Investigations, £57,388 to investigate her conduct during the affair, including £3,015 in hotel bills for the investigator. The cost of a previous external investigation into her has yet to be disclosed. Outram said the investigatory process against Mills lacked “fairness, balance and compassion”. A spokesperson for the Nuffield trust said Dunn “has accepted the failings and shortcomings around the handling of events leading up to and surrounding the whistleblowing”. Dr Jenny Vaughan, chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, said: “What is deeply concerning to us is why lead members of the executive, who were responsible, are still on the trust payroll on apparently the same terms.” She backed Mills’ calls for the managers involved to be held to account: “Without hounding people, in the way Dr Mills was treated by them, there must be accountability by management for this debacle. Saying that they ‘accept the failings and shortcomings’ in no way makes up for the damage done. Continuing to take a full pay packet while clinging to their position after such a devastating report speaks volumes about the seriousness with which these findings are being taken.” A source at the trust confirmed that Dunn was “working out the remainder of his employment, which includes his contractual notice period, at the Nuffield trust”.",News/Society,West Suffolk hospital chair resigns after whistleblowing scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/west-suffolk-hospital-chair-resigns-after-whistleblowing-scandal
12/24/2021,"Joe Root feels ready to “bang out” a seventh Test hundred in 2021 and has tipped England’s angry batting inquest to spark a wider response on Boxing Day. A rejigged lineup that is expected to see Zak Crawley replace Rory Burns at opener heads into the must-win third Ashes under instructions to get ruthless. It follows the decision by the head coach, Chris Silverwood, to make his players rewatch their dismissals from the 275-run defeat in Adelaide together.  Even Root, sitting only 158 runs away from Mohammad Yousuf’s Test record of 1,788 in a calendar year, has revisited his approach. On Thursday he batted with a fourth stump behind him in the MCG nets, having put his failure to turn his eighth half-century in Australia into three figures down to a lack of discipline outside off. Speaking before the third Test of five, with his team 2-0 down, Root said: “I’m confident I can bang out a hundred in these conditions. I feel in a really good place with my batting. I know that’s a brave thing to say but that conversion rate, this year, it’s not been an issue at all. I just need to put myself in those positions, have the bit between my teeth, [and think]: ‘Over my dead body.’” Asked whether, as a captain who is usually soft-spoken, it felt easy to dispense some harsh words to the underperforming batting unit, Root replied: “It did at the end of the last game because of the situation we’re in and the manner in which we lost. “I’ll always try to look at things with a level, pragmatic approach but I don’t think you could after the way we’ve played those last two games. I expect a response from everyone this week. “There’s no motivation needed, really. Just the state of the series, what’s at stake and what we need to do, quite simply. I would like to bring a nice Christmas present home for everyone who stays up [to watch on TV back in the UK]. We are doing everything we can to make sure it is 2-1 by the time we leave here.” Despite a personally golden year with the bat, Root has recently been replaced as No 1 in the Test batting rankings by Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne, a batsman held up as the template for the bloody-minded approach required in Australia. “I’ve never been one for [the rankings] but it would be nice to have it back for Christmas,” said Root. When asked if his captaincy is on the line this week, Root replied: “I’ll worry about that at the end of the series, all I can control is the next game. Those decisions are above my head but I’ll make sure from a team point of view we’ll show a lot more this time.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root confident he can ‘bang out’ a hundred as England look to hit back,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/joe-root-confident-he-can-bang-out-hundred-england-look-to-hit-back-ashes-third-test-melbourne
12/24/2021,"Boxing Day at the MCG is one of Australia’s most iconic days of sport and for the first time in 10 years, through a quirk of the schedule rather than England’s fortunes, its Ashes Test remains a live contest. Just. In 2010 the tourists were a confident, well-drilled side under Andrew Strauss hunting retention of the urn, a mission they completed handsomely. By contrast, their modern equivalents will walk out on in front of 70,000 spectators needing to prove the lessons they always speak of after defeat have been learned.  These in part revolve around a discipline outside off stump, the lack of which afflicted Australia back then. When bowled out for 98 by Jimmy Anderson, Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett, all 10 wickets were caught between wicketkeeper and gully. Melbourne’s mighty coliseum was practically deserted by the time England reached 157 for no loss by stumps. Expecting a repeat this year requires the optimism of Dr Pangloss but Joe Root’s men, fresh from the dressing room lock-in staged by their head coach, Chris Silverwood, after their slump to 2-0, can really only improve. Nearly every decision taken so far has backfired, be it selection or strategy, while non-negotiables such as catching or no-balls have been costly. For Root, these have exacerbated the situation. “There was a lot of frustration [after Adelaide],” said Root. “Purely because of the basic mistakes that we’ve been making. And we’ve done it twice in a row. And, as I said to the group, I don’t think they’re that much better than us in these conditions. “The scoreline would suggest they’re absolutely a far better team than us and I don’t think they are. If we perform anywhere like we can, we’ll put them in an uncomfortable position and find ourselves in a very different situation leaving this ground.” Which players can achieve this was still up in the air three days out from the toss. The expectation is that Zak Crawley will resume his Test career, a call based on a belief that the 6ft 5in right-hander will be suited to Australian conditions rather than any tangible form on a tour without state games. Rory Burns, whose first-ball dismissal in Brisbane was war-gamed by the coaching staff before the series yet still proved defining, may make way. If Haseeb Hameed is backed over Burns as expected, despite little more by way of output from the top of the order, it may be a reflection of the approach espoused during the truth session rather than a sign of looking to the future. After all, another late call comes at No 6, a choice between a struggling star of the future in Ollie Pope and Jonny Bairstow, who would boomerang back for a 79th Test cap. Then there is the seam attack, publicly criticised by Root for not bowling full enough in Adelaide. It was a move which led Ricky Ponting to question the captain’s authority and, more recently, Steve Harmison to claim he would be “waiting at the top of the stairs” had Michael Vaughan said the same back in the day. England (possible) Zak Crawley, Haseeb Hameed, Dawid Malan, Joe Root (c), Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler (wk), Ollie Robinson, Mark Wood, Jack Leach, Jimmy Anderson Australia (probable) David Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Lyon Third Test, Boxing Day to 30 December, Melbourne Cricket Ground Given time to reflect, Root tried to explain he simply wanted bowled and lbw to be in the equation a touch more often. And not least against Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith, two insatiable batting tragics who happily leave all day and do so with a flourish which, however ridiculous it looks, makes this a win for them rather than a stalemate. “I think what I was trying to say was as soon as we [went full to Labuschagne and Smith], we showed how dangerous we could be and how many problems we caused them,” said Root. “And we know those two players in particular, [if you] dismiss them for not many runs it will cause all sorts of panic. We saw it this time last year when Australia lost to India, it has a massive effect on the rest of the batting group.” A moribund drop-in pitch at the MCG had become a source of angst, with the Ashes Test here four years ago, when Alastair Cook ground out an unbeaten 244 in a match of just 24 wickets, arguably the nadir. But last year’s Test suggests improvement, even if local nerves were betrayed when a decent surface for a Sheffield Shield match this season still made for front page news in Melbourne. India’s dominant win 12 months ago saw seamers encouraged but the dual spin of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja claim eight of the 20 Australian wickets. It may be that, along with the pace of Mark Wood, Jack Leach is back. If so, Anderson and Stuart Broad could start to rotate for one spot in this series, while Ollie Robinson’s bowling should see him preferred to Chris Woakes. To sum up England’s time, this would mean dropping their third highest run-scorer. Australia meanwhile welcome back Pat Cummins as captain after the elite honesty that followed his close contact with a positive Covid case, while the struggling opener Marcus Harris has been backed for one more chance by Justin Langer. Despite a surprise triumph in the T20 World Cup, Australia’s head coach began this series under pressure for his position after a year of grumbling from inside the dressing room about an apparently suffocating style. Yet on Thursday, Langer was speaking openly about his desire to secure a contract renewal next year. Instead it his English equivalent, Silverwood, who goes into Boxing Day needing his methods to translate into immediate results.",Sport/Sport,England put recriminations aside and spy chance to put Australia in a ‘panic’ | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/england-put-recriminations-aside-and-spy-chance-to-put-australia-in-a-panic
12/24/2021,"British construction company Balfour Beatty will pay $65m (£49m) in fines after pleading guilty to fraud committed against the US military. The company’s US arm was one of the biggest providers of privatised military housing to the US army, navy and air forces at 55 bases across the states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas, but it lied about repairs in order to increase bonus payments, the US Department of Justice said on Thursday.  The company, a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, had to meet various maintenance and resident satisfaction targets to qualify for the bonuses. But employees deliberately altered data in its property management software and falsified resident comment cards to reach the required levels. The payout includes a $34m penalty plus nearly $32m in restitution, and the company will also be supervised for three years by an independent compliance monitor. It is not the first time that Balfour Beatty has been censured for defence-related work. In the UK in 2019 MI6 sacked the company as a contractor during refurbishment work after it lost sensitive plans of the layout of its headquarters in London’s Vauxhall, which are famously featured in several James Bond spy films. The deputy head of the FBI, which was also involved in the recent fraud inquiry, said it was a “disgraceful” crime. Two former Balfour Beatty managers, Stacy Cabrera and Rick Cunefare, have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the case this year. The fines are more than Balfour Beatty’s entire profit before tax for 2020 of £48m, although they are only a small proportion of revenues of £8.6bn during that year. The company, valued at £1.6bn, is struggling with other problems in its main UK building business, which counts Hinkley Point nuclear power station and the HS2 and Crossrail rail developments among its major projects. The chief executive, Leo Quinn, who was paid £2.1m in salary and bonuses in 2020, warned in August that the company would not take on any new property construction projects in central London after it was forced to prop up failing subcontractors. The US deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said: “Instead of promptly repairing housing for US service members as required, Balfour Beatty lied about the repairs to pocket millions of dollars in performance bonuses. “This pervasive fraud was a consequence of Balfour Beatty’s broken corporate culture, which valued profit over the welfare of service members.” The fraud meant that crucial maintenance was delayed, harming military personnel and their families, the Department of Justice said. Balfour Beatty said it had appointed a chief compliance officer for the US after carrying out a review when the fraud was first discovered, as well as adding further ethics and compliance training for all employees. “The wrongdoing that took place is completely contrary to the way the company expects its people to behave,” Balfour Beatty said in a statement to the stock market on Thursday. “The company apologises for the actions of communities to all its stakeholders. It has been made clear to all employees that breaches of policies, procedures, or law will not be tolerated.”",News/Business,Balfour Beatty to pay £49m fine for fraud against US military,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/balfour-beatty-to-pay-49m-fine-for-against-us-military
12/24/2021,"A fan-led attempt to return Bury FC to life has taken a great step forward after the government pledged £1m towards a bid to buy back Gigg Lane. The funding, announced as part of the Community Ownership Fund run by the Department for Levelling Up, will be matched against money raised by a consortium of bidders led by two supporters’ groups and the US-based benefactor Peter Alexander. Sources close to the deal say they hope it will now be completed imminently.  The purchase of Gigg Lane would herald the possibility of Bury returning to competition at the start of the 2022-23 season, three years after the club went into liquidation. It would also see the stadium transformed into a community hub with an all-weather pitch and gym installed for public use and the redevelopment of the Manchester Road stand to accommodate NHS services. Matthew Pickup of the Est 1885 supporters’ group, which has helped drive the proposed deal, said a return to Gigg Lane was “agonisingly close”. “This funding will allow us the opportunity to complete the purchase of Gigg Lane in order to bring football back to its historic home after a nearly three-year hiatus,” he said. “There are still a few steps left in the process and we hope to provide a further update in the coming days when the legalities have been completed but we thank all the fans for their continued support.” Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up said: “The collapse of Bury FC is a stain on English football and the result of the game being ripped out of the hands of the supporters and communities who made it what it is by big business and corporate interest. “I pay enormous tribute to Bury’s supporters, who have shown incredible resolve in their fight to bring their beloved club back to life. By helping rescue the historic Gigg Lane stadium, we are helping to put power back into their hands and securing a cherished asset for the wider community.” Further negotiations over the bid will now take place between the bidders and Bury council, which has committed to contributing funds to the deal. Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council said: “This is an important day but we need to renew our efforts to get over the line.” If a deal is done an application must then be submitted to the Football Association for a return to competition, and a specific division agreed for the club to compete in.",Sport/Football,Government pledges £1m to help Bury fans to buy back Gigg Lane,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/government-pledge-1m-to-help-bury-fans-to-buy-back-gigg-lane
12/24/2021,"Dorothy Wordsworth’s rare achievement as the other great writer in the Wordsworth family and an early environmentalist (Editorial, 19 December) is the focus of a year-long celebration of her life in the town where she was born on Christmas Day 250 years ago – Cockermouth in Cumbria. The centrepiece of the project, supported by our local councils, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and others, is a unique Portrait of Dorothy light installation artwork that this year is part of the town’s much loved Christmas lights. Commissioned by the local charity that I chair, Kirkgate Arts and Heritage, from the Cumbrian arts practice ArtFly, the “statue in light” stands on a temporary plinth woven from Cumbrian willow and hazel.  Our town is not only known for its associations with Dorothy’s brother William but also with the scientist John Dalton, the mutineer Fletcher Christian and a colonial viceroy of India, Lord Mayo, whose huge statue has dominated our Main Street since 1875 following his assassination. Standing alongside Mayo, albeit more modestly and temporarily, Dorothy’s portrait is a reminder of her talent and her values, which resonate so strongly in our own times. She remains an inspiration for overlooked women everywhere.Marion BowmanChair, Kirkgate Arts and Heritage  I would recommend two books by the poet-scholar Lucy Newlyn, who was mentioned in your editorial: William & Dorothy Wordsworth: “All in Each Other” (2013) and Vital Stream (2019); they are more than perfect Christmas presents. In the earlier book, Newlyn invokes Marcel Mauss’s observations “that bonds are created through gifts, in a mutual interdependence of giver and receiver”. In Vital Stream, Newlyn gives us 135 sonnets covering the lives of William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy through the spring and summer of 1802. In his introduction to Vital Stream, Richard Holmes quite rightly argues that Newlyn’s extraordinary sonnets should be read out on the radio. What about on TV, in Grasmere? That really would be something!Bruce Ross-SmithOxford  In the British Library there is a copy of AS Cottle’s The Edda of Saemund (1797). It is bound in a beautiful green fabric, with white horses, like the one at Uffington, dancing about. I wish someone would reproduce it. It is said to be made from a piece of one of Mrs Wordsworth’s old gowns. The English poet Robert Southey mentions the “good lady’s bookbinding propensities”. I wonder if the gown had been Dorothy’s rather than Mary Wordsworth’s, who seems to have dressed in a rather more sombre fashion.Eyke ShannonWestleton, Suffolk  Your editorial refers to Lucy Newlyn’s argument that Dorothy and William were “equal partners in writing”. If, according to legend, and as depicted in the 2000 film Pandaemonium, William’s “I wandered lonely as a cow” was redrafted as “cloud” at Dorothy’s behest, hers may have been the defining spirit of Wordsworth.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/24/2021,"At my grammar school in the 1960s, girls took domestic science while boys studied civics/local history (Letters, 17 December). DS lessons began with the making and embroidering of a gingham apron; for the practical lessons, we were bussed to the kitchens of a secondary modern school 15 miles away as our grammar school did not have a DS “laboratory”. The boys used to eat our lemon meringue pies on the bus during the return journey to school. One report of mine read: “Her results are fair but she shows little enthusiasm for washing up and cleaning sinks.” I failed to earn my washing-up badge at Brownies, not surprisingly. At university in the late 60s (where I studied politics/sociology), a frequent chat-up line from male students (who had had no DS lessons) was “show me how to boil an egg/fry bacon”. In my first job in the 70s as a teacher of politics and sociology at a comprehensive, there was a “school flat” with a kitchen. The girls had to clean and serve a weekly meal to the headteacher and staff. One male colleague regularly slept in the flat as he lived miles away from the school – he was often spotted by amused students having breakfast in a nearby cafe.  I recall seeing a question on a GCE exam paper at the time that clearly saw DS as a female activity: “Your brother arrives home late after a school football match. Describe how you would wash, launder and iron his PE kit ready for the next day, taking into account that some items were muddy and torn.” By the 90s, when my sons were in secondary education, “food technology” had replaced cookery and domestic science and, thanks to equality legislation, all students studied the subject. Instead of washing up, students had to produce a design folder showing every stage involved in making a pizza. My sons probably learned more from Ready Steady Cook on TV than from these lessons, but they are both excellent cooks today (they can wash up as well).Stephanie GarrettWelwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Probably Jacob Rees-Mogg will find this “comically woke”, as he did when Beano’s Fatty was renamed Freddy. But this is serious progress. Trivialising skin conditions with nicknames and representing villains as those with skin conditions legitimises the stigmatisation of those suffering, adding to the impact on young people’s mental health.  I am all for exposure and normalisation of skin conditions in all forms of media, so I am really glad that characters like Scotty are in the Beano.

12/24/2021,"Vladimir Putin has deployed his troops to the border with Ukraine, delivered impossible demands on Europe and appears ready to launch a new offensive to establish his domination over Kyiv. Putin is said to feel a “historical mission” to reverse Ukraine’s drift towards the west, despite his own role in creating a rift by annexing Crimea and fuelling a war in Ukraine’s south-east. But his current fast pace raises questions of why he appears to feel the moment to act is now, as if he is running out of time.  From Putin’s perspective, he may look to recent events in Ukraine and believe it’s all downhill from here. His attempt to force Ukraine to reintegrate the eastern Donbas region, a poison pill that could give him a veto over the country’s geopolitical path, has failed as the Minsk agreements that would have steered it come close to collapse. His proxies may control a sliver of Ukraine’s south-east but the rest of the country has drifted further from his control. At the same time, Putin is alarmed by growing military cooperation between Ukraine and the west, including military assistance and prospective arms sales from the UK, joint military drills with Nato countries, deliveries of US Javelin anti-tank missiles, and purchases of Turkish drones. He argues that the country is de facto becoming an “unofficial” member of Nato, an “anti-Russia” that he claims could one day host western troops or even missiles. “They came to the conclusion that trends weren’t heading in their direction, that they were heading toward geopolitical defeat,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation. The Kremlin’s early plan of “waiting it out”, for Ukrainians to lose patience with their new government and for the west to lose interest in Ukraine, was no longer viable. The Kremlin “decided that the status quo was intolerable and it needed to be changed”. To do that, Putin has said he is open to negotiations and has demanded a new treaty with Nato to roll back its expansion by removing troops and infrastructure from countries that joined after 1997, a non-starter in much of eastern Europe. At the same time, Putin has made it clear he is impatient to obtain his “security guarantees” immediately and has treated his potential negotiating partners with open disdain. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, who ran for office on a peace platform, has come “under the influence of radical elements,” Putin said on Thursday. Negotiations with his government have basically ceased. Last month Russian diplomats leaked their communications with their French and German counterparts, essentially scuttling chances for further negotiations with European powers. That leaves Joe Biden, a politician whom Putin may grant more respect but has made clear he does not trust. Even his promises, Putin says, may as well be written in sand. “You and I know well that even they, legal guarantees, cannot be trusted because the United States easily withdraws from all international agreements it loses interest in for one reason or another while explaining it somehow or giving no explanations whatsoever,” he told his top commanders on Tuesday. That leaves Putin the option of military force, a contingency that he appears ready to use. The Russian president appears consumed with the Ukraine question – this summer he published a 6,000-word essay on the topic under his own name – and Russian analysts have proposed that solving his dilemma could determine his own timeline as Russia’s leader. “It appears that what he manages to achieve in Ukraine will be the deciding factor in whether or not Putin stays on after 2024,” wrote Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, this month. While it is difficult to imagine Putin stepping down after 24 years in power, it is also possible that his desire to regain Ukraine as a “brotherly” nation could be one factor compelling him to stay on into the future. “If victory hasn’t yet been achieved, perhaps it’s not the time to step down,” wrote Baunov.",News/World news,Why Putin is acting like a man who has run out of time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/vladimir-putin-russian-president-ukraine-analysis
12/24/2021,"More than 800 faith leaders have called on the Biden administration and Senate Democrats to pass voting rights legislation next year. “We cannot be clearer, you must act now to protect every American’s freedom to vote without interference and with confidence that their ballot will be counted and honored. Passing comprehensive voting rights legislation must be the number-one priority of the administration and Congress,” faith leaders said in a letter addressed to the president and Senate members on Wednesday.  The letter, organized by Martin Luther King III and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, was signed by various faith organizations, including the African American Christian Clergy Coalition, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action and Faith in Public Life. Signatories include those who come from Muslim, Christian and Jewish communities, including Reverend Canon Leonard L Hamlin Sr of the Washington National Cathedral and Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg of National Council of Jewish Women. “The communities we represent will continue to sound the alarm until these bills are passed. While we come from different faiths, we are united by our commitment to act in solidarity with the most vulnerable among us,” the letter added. The letter comes after Republicans successfully filibustered voting rights bills on four different occasions this year. Most recently, on 3 November, Republicans in the Senate blocked the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Acts – one of two major pieces of voting rights legislation that Democrats have championed in Congress in attempts to prevent Republicans from eroding easy access to the vote. Republicans blocking the key voting rights bill in November was a move seen by many as a breaking point in the push to eliminate the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. Despite numerous Democrats calling for the elimination of the filibuster, they lack the votes to end the rule due to not only a slim majority but also opposition within their own party. Two Democrats, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, are strongly opposed, arguing that the rule forges bipartisan compromise. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, described the filibuster on 3 November as a “low, low point in the history of this body”. In Wednesday’s letter, faith leaders said, “Nothing – including the filibuster – should stand in the way of passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, both of which have already passed the House and await Senate action and leadership.” According to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice, nineteen states have enacted nearly three dozen laws between January and the end of September that make it more difficult to vote. Wednesday’s letter is a reflection of the growing pressure on Democrats to pass voting rights legislation that aims to outlaw excessive partisan gerrymandering and would require early voting, no-excuse mail-in voting, in addition to automatic and same-day registration. “It’s time to stop lamenting the state of our democracy and take action to address it,” the letter said.",News/US news,‘It’s time to take action’: faith leaders urge Biden to pass voting rights legislation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/biden-administration-voting-rights-legislation
12/24/2021,"Pep Guardiola has suggested players should consider going on strike to demand a reduction in their workload, as player welfare moved to the heart of the debate over the Premier League’s Covid crisis. With two more top-flight matches postponed and league officials meeting with club captains and managers to discuss their concerns, temperatures continued to rise even as the various parties agreed to muddle on with the traditional festive programme.  Guardiola took the most provocative line, suggesting direct action may be required before the game’s authorities heeded concerns over demands placed on players. “Should the players and the managers be all together and make a strike?” Manchester City’s manager said. “Just through words it’s not going to be solved. For Fifa, the Premier League, the broadcasters, the business is more important than their welfare. The simplest example is all around the world they have five substitutions; here it’s still three. Tell me one argument to take care of players’ welfare than this one? Here, where everyone decides for themselves, we didn’t do it.” Guardiola’s words were picked up by the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, Maheta Molango, who demanded that authorities take the concerns of elite players more seriously. “I’ve spoken with many senior players on this issue,” he said. “I can tell you that it isn’t going away. Players don’t choose to speak out on issues like this without having given it a lot of thought. Now it’s up to those who run the game at all levels to begin to take this seriously so it’s an issue that can be addressed constructively with players at the heart of the conversation. That has to happen now. ” Top-flight players are understood to feel aggrieved with the Premier League over a lack of direct communication. Regular meetings held with club captains during Project Restart have not continued and this week’s meeting had been postponed from Monday until Thursday. There are also concerns a new player welfare department within the league has not been proactive enough. The rescheduled meeting ended with captains and the league agreeing to engage in more frequent dialogue. This week the Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, told the BBC that “nobody really takes player welfare seriously”. Among elite players there is concern not only over playing a condensed fixture list during a Covid outbreak but also over upcoming changes to the professional calendar that will mean an expanded Champions League and potentially a World Cup every two years. As the Boxing day matches Liverpool v Leeds and Wolves v Watford became the latest fixtures to be postponed because of Covid outbreaks at the two away teams, Henderson’s concern was echoed by Rafael Benítez. The Premier League rejected a request to postpone Everton’s Boxing Day game at Burnley despite five positive Covid cases and six injuries in Benítez’s squad. The manager believes his club are being punished for not closing their training ground and that the league’s integrity could be damaged by fulfilling fixtures with academy players. The league concluded Everton have enough players to fulfil the Burnley fixture. Their available contingent includes Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has not played for two months because of a thigh muscle re-injury, and several academy players with top-flight experience. One, the 18-year-old midfielder Tyler Onyango, has made two 89th-minute substitute appearances in the Premier League and an 85th-minute substitute’s appearance in the FA Cup. Benítez said: “Money is now managing the game and it is quite complicated to find the right solution. We are professionals and have to manage the situation but the fans, everybody, want to see the best players on the pitch and playing at the best level possible. You sell the TV rights because you play nice and exciting football, but then all these things happen.” Football Premier League: 26 December – Liverpool v Leeds, Wolves v Watford Championship: 26 December – Barnsley v Stoke, Cardiff v Coventry, Fulham v Birmingham, Millwall v Swansea, Peterborough v Reading, Preston v Sheffield United League One: 26 December – AFC Wimbledon v Charlton, Bolton v Morecambe, Crewe v Wigan, Portsmouth v Oxford, Sheffield Wednesday v Burton, Wycombe v Cambridge. 30 December – Cambridge v Doncaster League Two: 26 December – Bradford v Harrogate, Bristol Rovers v Sutton, Colchester v Leyton Orient, Exeter v Swindon, Newport v Forest Green, Northampton v Walsall, Port Vale v Salford, Stevenage v Crawley. 29 December – Forest Green v Exeter, Walsall v Bradford Scottish Championship: 26 December – Inverness CT v Partick     Despite airing the possibility of a strike, Guardiola does not believe there is appetite for one. “No I don’t think so, because we want to play, we want to continue,” he said. Although the Premier League has been the object of much of the criticism from managers over scheduling, it was the clubs who voted to reintroduce the three substitutes rule, making the league Europe’s only top-flight competition not to take advantage of relaxed rules. Clubs voted against the measures twice but they can be put back on the agenda by a club at a shareholders’ meeting. One suggestion for clearing space in the calendar was staging one-leg semi-finals in the Carabao Cup. After progressing to the final four on Wednesday, Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp and Tottenham’s Antonio Conte suggested that home and away ties for the semis should be scrapped, but this proposal is unlikely to be considered by the competition organisers, the EFL, because it would cost an estimated £20m in lost revenue from sponsorship and broadcast rebates. Manchester United’s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, went further on Thursday, suggesting that the League Cup could be abolished to ease the congested schedule. “England is the only country in the top five leagues in Europe that plays two cup competitions,” he said. “This is something we could maybe speak about and discuss. I know the reason for that: the League Cup is kept for the third and fourth division teams to improve the financial situations of those clubs. But I still think if we talk about a tight calendar, maybe having to play too many games, this could be something where we speak and discuss.” Rangnick also acknowledged, however, that he was looking forward to being in charge at Old Trafford during the Christmas period. “You know better than I do what a big tradition it is to play on Boxing Day and the 27th,” Rangnick said before a game at Newcastle scheduled for 27 December. “I think we should stick to this and respect this tradition. I’m looking forward to that for the first time in my coaching career.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola makes strike claim as angry Benítez joins chorus over player welfare,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/pep-guardiola-strike-angry-benitez-player-welfare-premier-league
12/24/2021,"Joan Didion, the eminent journalist, author and anthropologist of contemporary American politics and culture – a singularly clear, precise voice across a multitude of subjects for more than 60 years – has died at her home in Manhattan, New York. She was 87 years old. The cause of death was Parkinson’s disease, according to Paul Bogaards, an executive at Didion’s publisher Knopf.  Known for her pioneering blend of the personal and the political in her journalism and essays, Didion became a household name with her writing on US society. A standout female figure in the very male New Journalism movement alongside Tom Wolfe, Truman Capote and Gay Talese, Didion cast her precise, coolly-detached eye over both American society and her own life in writing that was collected in books including Slouching Towards Bethlehem, her sharp-eyed journey through the promise and dissolution of California’s 60s counterculture, and The White Album, which began, in her economic, astute style, with, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” “We have kind of evolved into a society where grieving is totally hidden. It doesn’t take place in our family. It takes place not at all,” she told the Associated Press in 2005 after publishing The Year of Magical Thinking, an account of losing her husband John Gregory Dunne. Didion spent her later years in New York, but she was shaped by her native state of California, “a hologram that dematerializes as I drive through it”. “A place,” she once wrote, “belongs forever to whoever claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it so radically that he remakes it in his own image.” Famous for her detached, sometimes elegiac tone, Didion returned to alienation and isolation throughout her career, whether she was exploring her own grief after the death of her husband John Gregory Dunne in the Pulitzer-winning The Year of Magical Thinking, the emptiness of Hollywood life in the novel Play It As It Lays, or expats caught up in Central American politics in her novel A Book of Common Prayer. She was highly protective of her work, never telling even close friends the new subject of her interrogation until it was ready to publish. “Nobody writes better English prose than Joan Didion,” literary critic John Leonard once wrote. “Try to rearrange one of her sentences, and you’ve realized that the sentence was inevitable, a hologram.” In her most recent collection of selected essays, Let Me Tell You What I Mean, the Guardian wrote: “Didion has established a way of narration that focuses not so much on events as on subtexts, atmospheres and perceptions. She is usually present in her essays as a voice rather than a character, observer rather than participant – though the boundaries regularly blur.” After her death was announced, tributes poured in from across the spectrum of politics and letters. California ​governor Gavin Newsom said Didion was “peerless in her capacity to write about life, loss, love and society – easily the best living writer in California. Her ability to put the tapestry of California and the times into words made her a treasure for her generation and generations to come.” Author Susan Orlean called Didion “my idol and inspiration”. “Didion was one of the country’s most trenchant writers and astute observers,” Penguin Random House and its imprint Knopf said in a statement. Shelley Wanger, Didion’s editor at Knopf since the early 90s, told the Guardian the author was a masterful and fearless essayist and novelist. “She always seemed able to hear and see what other journalists missed and her range was broad from California, rock and roll, to US culture and politics, Central America to memoir. Her writing is timelessly original, prescient and unexpected.” Born in Sacramento in 1934, Didion spent her early childhood free from the restrictions of school, with her father’s job in the Army Air Corps taking the family all over the country. A “nervous” child with a tendency to headaches, Didion nonetheless began her path early, starting her first notebook when she was five. In a 2003 interview with the Guardian, she recalled an incident when she was 10: while writing a story about a woman who killed herself by walking into the ocean, she “wanted to know what it would feel like, so I could describe it” and almost drowned on a California beach. She never told her parents. (“I think the adults were playing cards.”) In 1956, after majoring in English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, she won Vogue’s writing contest when she was 21, which led to a seven-year stint working at the magazine’s offices in New York. There she met Dunne – they’d marry when she was 29 – and between New York and Los Angeles, she began to mix with many famous contemporaries who would become friends, colleagues and rivals: Sylvia Plath, Roman Polanski, Janis Joplin (who crashed a house party), Christopher Isherwood (who called her “Mrs Misery” in his diaries), Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood (who shared her clothes with Didion). In 1963, her first book was published: the novel Run, River. In 1966, Didion and Dunne relocated to Los Angeles and adopted a baby girl, Quintana Roo, named after the Mexican state. Her first collection of essays, Slouching Towards Bethlehem was published in 1968: with its title essay about Haight-Ashbury’s hippy community, the collection established Didion’s voice as exceptional; in the New York Times’s review at the time, Dan Wakefield called Didion, “one of the least celebrated and most talented writers of my own generation”. Didion followed it up with her novel about life in Hollywood, Play It As It Lays, which she later adapted into a screenplay with Dunne; the couple often worked together on screenplays, including the 1976 film A Star Is Born. A smattering of fiction would follow over the next two decades – A Book of Common Prayer (1977), Democracy (1984) and The Last Thing He Wanted (1996) – but non-fiction dominated. Her second essay collection, The White Album (1979) contained her most famous line: “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” In 1983 came Salvador, a book-length essay about a trip she took to El Salvador with Dunne; Miami (1987), about the city’s Cuban expat community; After Henry (1992), a collection dedicated to Didion’s editor Henry Robbins; and Political Fictions (2001), which spanned the elections of US presidents George HW Bush, Bill Clinton and George W Bush. Over decades, the diminutive Didion built her own mythology; more than one journalist, when interviewing her, noted her quietness and frail frame with surprise. Her elegant style and interest in fashion, fostered at Vogue, also saw her revered as a a symbol of “cool”; at the age of 80, she became the face of French fashion house Céline. From the 1980s onwards, Didion focused on politics, coining the term “the permanent political class” to describe the fraternity of media, politicians and strategists that shape the US’s self-image. After Clinton’s impeachment, she wrote: “No one who ever passed through an American high school could have watched William Jefferson Clinton running for office in 1992 and failed to recognise the familiar predatory sexuality of the provincial adolescent.” Among Washington journalists, she wrote, “what ‘fairness’ has often come to mean is a scrupulous passivity, an agreement to cover the story not as it is occurring but as it is presented, which is to say as it is manufactured.” When Dunne died of a heart attack in 2003, Didion began writing The Year of Magical Thinking, an exploration of her grief at his death while, at the same time, their daughter Quintana was severely ill in hospital. Unsparingly documenting her resulting strange habits, such as keeping Dunne’s shoes for when he “came back”, the book won her a Pulitzer prize. Months after it came out in 2005, her daughter Quintana died from acute pancreatitis aged 39, which Didion would write about in her 2011 reflection on ageing and parenting, Blue Nights. When she was presented with her National Medal of Arts and the National Humanities medal in 2012, President Barack Obama told the room: “I’m surprised she hasn’t already gotten this award.” In her later years, Didion wrote less; her most recent project was as the subject of Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold, a 2018 Netflix documentary made by her nephew, Griffin Dunne. Her final book, South and West, was a collection of her notes while travelling around Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana in the 1970s; when it was released in 2017, it was marketed as a prescient take on the then newly elected president Donald Trump’s base of voters. Talking to the Guardian when it was released, Didion said: “I suppose the crisis in American politics was behind everything I was thinking, whether or not I knew I was thinking it. These things have a way of creeping in. I think we currently are living through the scariest of times.”",Arts/Books,"Joan Didion, American journalist and author, dies at age 87",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/23/joan-didion-american-journalist-and-author-dies-at-age-87
12/24/2021,"Evidence that infections caused by Omicron may be less severe than other Covid variants is good news but is likely to make little or no difference to the duration of the pandemic, according to experts. Several pieces of research published this week suggest that people infected with Omicron are much less likely to require hospitalisation.  Those with the variant are estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to attend A&E compared with the Delta variant, and 50% to 70% less likely to be require admission to hospital, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Thursday. Separately, researchers at the University of Edinburgh studied infections from the Delta and Omicron variants since November and said the results “suggest that Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of Covid-19 hospitalisation when compared with Delta”. But experts warned that the results suggested no change in the level of infection. In the UK, the huge surge in cases – with another 119,789 new infections reported on Thursday – means that even if only a small proportion of people with Covid need to attend hospital, it could cause difficulties for the NHS. Mark Woolhouse, a professor at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Scotland study, said the weight of new research meant that projections would be less pessimistic, although Omicron’s rapid spread meant there were still dangers ahead. “It’s good but it doesn’t get us out of the woods. Severity of infection is clearly very important but it is only one factor in terms of the public health burden,” Woolhouse said, speaking in a personal capacity. “The other thing is the sheer size of the wave. The simple way of looking at that, according to our data in Scotland, is an Omicron infection is about one-third as severe or likely to put you in hospital as a Delta infection. But if there are three times as many cases, then we are back where we started. “We should still be worried about the sheer size of the wave, the very fast growth rates, very fast doubling time. These peak numbers of cases that we have seen in the UK are still climbing, so it is the size of that wave that is worrying people most at the moment.” Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge, told Reuters that the hospital data was encouraging and “may help justify the government’s decision not to expand restrictions on social gathering over Christmas in England”. Another scientist, who did not want to be named because of involvement in ongoing research, said Omicron infections were going to be “hugely disruptive” because of the numbers needing to self-isolate “There’s a tremendous impact on the NHS because of the workforce getting infections,” they said. “But obviously it’s good news if a smaller fraction of those infections lead to severe illness.” Separate research published by scientists at Imperial College London found a reduction in hospital visits between Omicron and Delta cases, and estimated that those infected with Omicron were 40%-45% less likely to be hospitalised overnight than those with Delta. But the study also suggested that two doses of a Covid vaccine were not enough to combat Omicron alone. Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the co-authors of the Imperial study, said: “Given the high transmissibility of the Omicron virus, there remains the potential for health services to face increasing demand if Omicron cases continue to grow at the rate that has been seen in recent weeks.” Woolhouse said there remained substantial gaps in scientists’ knowledge of Omicron, such as how the UK’s booster campaign would affect the spread of infection. “Particularly, whether [boosters] not only stop people getting ill but also stop them getting infected and passing the infection on. That would also be very helpful – at the moment we don’t know that it has much impact on the spread of these cases,” Woolhouse said. “If it did have an impact on the spread of cases that would be further good news, and that would affect the size of the wave and therefore the public health burden.”",News/World news,"Good news is Omicron may be less severe, bad news is it’s surging faster",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/good-news-is-omicron-may-be-less-severe-bad-news-its-surging-faster
12/24/2021,"A hardship charity once chaired by Charles Dickens says shop workers are seeking its help due to the financial pain caused by the end of the universal credit uplift, fewer hours and the absence of sick pay. The Fashion and Textile Children’s Trust (FTCT) steps in to assist children whose parents work in the fashion industry but are struggling to make ends meet.  Anna Pangbourne, the charity’s chief executive, said the drop in visitors to stores and shopping centres this Christmas and speculation about new Covid restrictions were causing fresh anxiety about job security. The withdrawal of the £20-a-week universal credit top-up, which was introduced after the first lockdown, had been a shock for families, some of whom had got into debt during the pandemic said Pangbourne. “The effects of the initial lockdown are going to be felt for a long time,” she said. “We are continuing to reach out to industry families who don’t have the safety net of sick pay or savings.” In 2021 the charity received nearly 2,500 applications for grants, after a record 3,516 inquiries in 2020 when the high street was rocked by the failure of big employers Debenhams and Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia and the first wave of pandemic store closures. Families told the charity that the cut to universal credit had been felt keenly because most had started claiming it when the uplift was in place. Others said they had not received sick pay when off isolating or their children were ill or quarantining. This week, as part of a £1bn package of emergency financial support for hospitality and leisure businesses, the government reopened the statutory sick pay rebate scheme, which refunds companies with up to 250 employees for payment to staff. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant has led the union Usdaw to call on the government to review sick pay provisions. Staff who qualify for statutory sick pay receive £96.35 a week, but the retail workers’ union wants the payment to be based on normal earnings. The FTCT said the end of the furlough job support scheme meant people had returned to work but were often receiving fewer hours, and the accompanying reduction in pay was affecting their ability to pay bills and replace broken household appliances at a time when the cost of living is soaring. The charity, which was founded in 1853 by a group of philanthropic textile merchants to support the bereaved family of a colleague, helped 713 families in its last financial year. Its average grant is about £500, which Pangbourne said was used to provide children with “hot meals, comfy beds and warm clothes”. The work of the charity, originally called the Purley Children’s Trust, attracted the attention of Charles Dickens who chaired its appeal board from 1856 to 1857.",News/Business,"Shop workers experiencing financial hardship and job insecurity, says charity",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/shop-workers-experiencing-financial-hardship-and-job-insecurity-says-charity
12/24/2021,"Boris Johnson entered the fraught festive period with his authority in tatters after a string of self-inflicted crises, and with colleagues warning that cancelling Christmas could be the final straw for the exasperated British public. So early, tentative evidence that the Omicron variant may result in less severe health outcomes is the best Christmas present the prime minister could have hoped for.  Downing Street sources expressed caution about over-interpreting the data, with experts continuing to warn that the sheer size of the Omicron wave could still put severe pressure on the NHS, even if a smaller proportion of those infected end up in hospital. But there is now hope that at the very least, the decision on whether to impose strict new restrictions after Christmas may not be cut and dried. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have each announced a package of new rules from Boxing Day, ranging from limits on the largest outdoor events to the return of social distancing. Johnson was under pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to give families and businesses in England similar clarity by setting out his plans for the post-Christmas period. But ministers have said they do not yet have the data to act, and the cabinet has not been reconvened since a lengthy, inconclusive meeting on Monday. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has confirmed there will be no further announcements from the government this week. This wait-and-see approach received the endorsement of the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, who told Times Radio on Wednesday that he would not have introduced restrictions over Christmas. Blair argued that from a purely public health perspective the case for curbs was strong, but Omicron was so transmissible that only a full lockdown would be likely to have much effect, and this was too much of a “blunt instrument” to apply across the board to different categories of people, including the triple-jabbed. Johnson will now be hoping hospitalisations and other data provide a sufficient glimmer of hope to avoid a new year circuit breaker or other measures, such as limits on mixing. Having promised MPs the opportunity to vote on any restrictions, he would only be likely to get them through with the backing of Labour. That would delight the new shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, whose tactic has been to offer staunch support for government measures while highlighting the Tories’ divisions. Even if the data falls the right way and Johnson is able to avoid imposing fresh restrictions in the new year, however, Tory backbenchers appear unlikely to credit him for standing firm. Instead, the lockdown sceptics believe the prime minister was left with little room for manoeuvre after the historic rebellion against his plan B measures last week, which strengthened the arm of sceptical cabinet ministers. At the height of the Covid crisis in 2020 there was little cabinet consultation, with key decisions on draconian lockdown measures being made by an inner circle of Johnson, senior ministers and close advisers, while the full cabinet acted as little more than a rubber stamp. But Johnson’s power over his party is now considerably less secure, so that – as during Theresa May’s troubled premiership – the content of cabinet meetings is readily leaked, with jockeying rivals briefing their contributions to the press. Johnson will be sincerely relieved if England can start the new year free of harsh restrictions that could further batter his popularity, and he may even hope that, as with last year’s vaccine bounce, the end of the Omicron wave boosts the public mood. And it will certainly save him a fresh confrontation with battle-hardened backbenchers. But the pressure from within Johnson’s party over everything from political mismanagement to lockdown-busting parties, and from MPs looking at the North Shropshire result and fearing for their own future, is unlikely to abate.",News/Politics,Omicron news is boost for Boris Johnson but Tory pressure is still on,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/23/omicron-news-is-boost-for-boris-johnson-but-tory-pressure-is-still-on
12/24/2021,"Allowing women to give birth in hospital with their pet dog by their side could ease their anxiety, one of the first women to use a “birth dog” has said. Charlotte Beard, 24, who suffers from non-epileptic seizures, was supported through her 50-hour labour by her aid pet Flump, who is trained to detect seizures before they happen.  The fluffy-haired Maltese was prepared for the birth by being played audio tracks of babies crying at home and being introduced to staff at the maternity ward in Poole hospital. “I would say you can’t really do a practice run,” Beard joked. “He was visiting the maternity hospital on a very regular basis, getting to know staff, getting to know the different rooms and the setups. Even things like the different equipment that was going to be used, he would see that used on a regular basis.” Flump, two, attended every scan and every appointment alongside Beard. It is a legal requirement that assistance dogs are allowed into hospitals, but Beard said a lot of hospitals were not aware of this. “It would have caused high levels of anxiety if Flump was not there,” she said. “I would have certainly been more concerned about my safety. “I am not suggesting that if I were to have a seizure, staff would not have been able to look after me. But no staff member can detect beforehand whether you are going to have a seizure or not. That is something that Flump can do that nobody else can, and it gives them such valuable time to make sure that I am safe and have the right support in place before it happens. Prevention is always much better than treatment.” Beard gave birth to her son Alfie, weighing 6lb 10oz, after two days with Flump. Her partner and full-time carer, Ash Phoenix, 29, was present. Beard, a former wildlife rehabilitator who had to stop work due to her health, said Flump sat patiently at the end of the bed during the birth and then took in his stride the following days spent in the maternity ward. “We would regularly hear quite distressing noises and he was absolutely fantastic,” she said. “He slept through [a] lot of other people’s labours.” Beard said she was not sure whether she was the first woman in the UK to have an assistance pet present during birth, but the hospital where Alfie was born had certainly never allowed it before. Staff had to do lots of research and set up risk assessments before Flump could attend, she said. The idea of having a dog present had been put to Beard, who had studied animal behaviour and training, by a doctor. It was thought that having a dog at her side might give her more confidence. Beard had had three miscarriages previously and worried about having traumatic memories on her return to hospital. Beard got Flump at 10 weeks and has trained him since then. “From a human standpoint I cannot help but think how lovely it is that Flump was there. He was one of the first to see Alfie,” Beard said. “Obviously hormones play a great part in it. Being present there from the birth and meeting Alfie within moments of him being born, whether it has increased the bond or not, it was such a lovely experience for everyone. Flump was absolutely besotted with Alfie from the moment he first saw him.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,UK woman has baby in hospital with ‘birth dog’ by her side,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/23/uk-woman-delivers-baby-in-hospital-with-birth-dog-by-her-side
12/24/2021,"Flutter, the gambling company that owns Paddy Power and SkyBet, has agreed to buy the Italian operator Sisal in a £1.6bn deal that could have a significant bearing on the competition to run the UK’s national lottery. In a statement to the stock market, Flutter said it had struck a deal with the private equity group CVC Partners to buy Sisal, a major Italian gambling and betting firm which also operates lotteries in Italy, Turkey and Morocco.  The Flutter chief executive, Peter Jackson, said buying the Milan-based firm would give the company a “gold medal position” in Italy, the second-largest regulated gambling market in Europe, after the UK. Flutter said Sisal was fast-growing, particularly in online gambling, which increased by 20% in Italy as the Covid-19 pandemic drove punters to migrate online. The takeover puts Flutter, whose brands include Betfair, Paddy Power and SkyBet, in contention to take over the UK national lottery. Sisal is one of four firms bidding for the next 10-year licence to run the lottery. The Gambling Commission is expected to make a decision in February 2022 after a competition that has been prolonged several times, with the new licence due to start in 2024. Sisal is up against Camelot, which has run the Lottery since its inception in 1994, and the media tycoon Richard Desmond, who already owns the Health Lottery. The biggest threat to Camelot’s 27-year incumbency is thought to be the Czech operator Sazka, which is bidding via a special purpose vehicle set up in the UK called Allwyn. All of the bidders have submitted their final proposals and are waiting for the Gambling Commission’s decision. However, Flutter did not mention the UK lottery in a statement attached to the announcement of its takeover of Sisal. The Guardian understands that Flutter has not factored the bid into its plans. The takeover is not due to complete until April, by which time the national lottery decision will have been made. While the Gambling Commission oversees all gambling activity in the UK, including lotteries, sports betting and casino games, it has typically treated the national lottery as a separate entity with specialist staff devoted to it. Flutter is also the subject of an investigation by the commission, after the Guardian revealed that its SkyVegas brand offered “free spins” to recovering addicts. If Flutter is not considered a suitable firm to run the lottery, that would leave Camelot, Sazka and Richard Desmond fighting it out for the lucrative 10-year licence. Camelot has faced criticism, including from a parliamentary public accounts committee (PAC) report in 2018, that charitable donations have not always risen as fast as profits under its tenure. In the first year of the current lottery licence, Camelot booked an after-tax profit of £31.5m after ticket sales amounted to £5.45bn, raising more than £1.5bn for good causes. In the year that so exercised the PAC, 2016-17, Camelot’s profit was more than twice as high at £70m but it raised only a little more for good causes, about £1.6bn. Since then, Camelot has rebalanced things somewhat. Profits for the year to March 2021 have not been published in full but are thought to have reached £80m on the back of record sales of £8.37bn, with good-cause money also hitting an all-time high of £1.85bn. In the first half of the current financial year, to 30 September, Camelot recorded sales of £3.9bn, up 2.7% compared with the same period in 2020. The amount Camelot returned to good causes was £884.5m, up 2.4% on the previous year.",News/UK news,Flutter enters contest to run national lottery via Italian takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/flutter-enters-contest-to-run-national-lottery-via-italian-takeover
