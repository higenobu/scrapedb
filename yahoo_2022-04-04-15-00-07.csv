4/4/2022,"STORY: Pakistan plunged into political crisis on Sunday after Prime Minister Imran Khan dissolved parliament, thwarting an impending no-confidence vote that he was widely expected to lose. The opposition blames Khan for failing to crack down on corruption and revive the economy, which has been struggling with high inflation and widening deficits. A successful no-confidence vote would have opened the door to power for the opposition. Khan is now instead seeking fresh elections and has said - without evidence - that the move to oust him was orchestrated by the United States. The U.S. has denied any involvement. But Khan also said his claims of foreign interference were accepted by the country's national security body. ""It was confirmed that this plan (to oust me) was from abroad which was interference in Pakistan’s internal politics. And the basis of this no confidence vote was from abroad."" ""When the country’s highest national security body confirms this, then the proceedings were irrelevant, the numbers were irrelevant.” The opposition has called Khan's blocking of the vote 'unconstitutional' and has vowed to fight it. The Supreme Court said it would take up the matter on Monday, though Khan's fate is not immediately clear. Khan lost his majority in parliament after allies quit his coalition government and some others defected within his party. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed nation of more than 220 million people. No prime minister has finished a full five-year term since its independence from Britain in 1947.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Fresh turmoil for Pakistan as PM Khan dodges ouster,https://news.yahoo.com/fresh-turmoil-pakistan-pm-khan-051756398.html
