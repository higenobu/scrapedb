5/6/2022,"There have been times this week when Dmitry Bivol, the unbeaten and outstanding WBA world light-heavyweight champion, has been reduced to a ghostly figure in Las Vegas. Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez, his challenger on Saturday night, dominates boxing and so the layered and complex life of Bivol has been ignored. The 31-year-old Russian is regarded by many as simply the next opponent for the imperious Mexican. Canelo, the undisputed world super-middleweight champion, is jumping up to light-heavy to presumably dispatch Bivol before returning to his regular weight class in September to face his bitter rival Gennady Golovkin. Bivol, meanwhile, waits quietly in the shadows. He is asked mainly about his thoughts on Canelo and, far less often, about the war in Ukraine and how it feels to be a Russian fighting in America at a time when his country’s onslaught has devastated millions of lives. But, in a long and occasionally fraught conversation, the real story of Bivol unfolds. “My mother and father were born in the big country, the USSR,” he says wryly. “But my father was really born in Moldova and he spoke only Moldovan until he was 10. My mother [who is of Korean descent] was born in Kazakhstan. Then her family moved to Kyrgyzstan. One day, when they graduated, they met each other in Russia. They got married and moved to my mother’s home in Kyrgyzstan. I was born in Kyrgyzstan and lived there 11 years.” They spoke Russian at home but Bivol felt most affinity with Kyrgyzstan. “It’s a great country. It’s not a rich country but it has great people, nice people. It’s my motherland. A lot of my life afterwards was in Russia but I love Kyrgyzstan. I love the culture and it’s different to Russia. Kyrgyzstan is a Muslim country and I have many Muslim friends.” Bivol fell for boxing in Kyrgyzstan – after his interest in combat sports had been sparked by, he says with a grin, “Jackie Chan movies. He has a big heart and good fighting skills. I remember he never killed anyone in his movies. He was just funny.” There is no room for amusement when we turn to Russia. I ask Bivol what he felt as a Russian citizen when, on 24 February, Vladimir Putin launched his assault. “When I heard about the war, and even if it is in Vietnam or Iraq, it’s sad for me. We are people. We have to make a better world for all of us. Of course it’s sad.” Bivol’s stance is that politics and sport don’t mix. And yet even sport cannot evade this conflict. Russian teams have been banned from tournaments and individual Russian athletes have been prevented from competing in their chosen sport. Boxing, however, has chosen not to address the issue beyond the fact that the Russian anthem won’t be played in the ring on Saturday night. Is Bivol relieved or disappointed? “We all have to be proud of where we’re from. It doesn’t matter if it’s from Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Africa, England. I understand why I am without a flag here. No problem. I’m a sportsman. I am focused on the fight.” What are his views on the war? “I don’t know about politics,” Bivol says awkwardly. “I am in sport so I don’t know about coronavirus or politics. Most boxing fans just want to see the light heavyweight [champion] against the pound-for-pound king.” When it is pointed out that Wladimir Klitschko, the former world heavyweight champion, has called for his fight against Canelo to be cancelled, Bivol shrugs. “He’s political. He doesn’t have to watch.” Wladimir’s brother, Vitali, is the mayor of Kyiv. It is a sign of the esteem in which boxers are still held in Eastern Europe. Has he met Putin? “I met him once when he invited athletes at the world combat games in 2013.” Did he talk to Putin? “No. No. There were a lot of us there.” As much as he would prefer to avoid the war, Bivol admits his father would normally have flown from St Petersburg to support him in Vegas. But he has been unable to gain a visa from the US authorities. “Every time they worry about me and this is a real dangerous fight,” he says of his parents and his wife. “But they understand I love boxing. It helps my family and I am happy boxing helps me realise my potential.” Yet boxing is a grimly dangerous business and Bivol is moving when he remembers the death of Maxim Dadashev, the Russian light-welterweight who lost his life in July 2019 after suffering brain injuries in his fight in America against Subriel Matías. “Maxim was my friend,” Bivol says. “I knew him since 2003. We boxed and trained together and spent a lot of time at competitions because we were on the same St Petersburg team. He was a funny guy who always fought so hard. As a professional we see each other sometimes when I came to Los Angeles. I knew his family and his wife is now living next to me [in St Petersburg]. We invite his wife and his son to our house – like when my kids have a birthday.” How is Elizaveta, Maxim’s wife, coping? Bivol shakes his head. “For one year after his tragedy she was crying every day. It’s hard.” Did his death make Bivol consider his future in boxing? “Of course. In training I thought so much about defence. It’s dangerous. All my coaches said: ‘It’s better if you take zero punches and [land] one punch.” When he is not at home in St Petersburg, Bivol is training in California. “When I have a weekend to rest I like to walk on the beach, get some quesadillas, go to a museum. I’m not an expert on art but sometimes I like to spend time in art museums.” Bivol smiles shyly. He knows he is a real expert in the ring – even if some doubt he will ever get a decision against Canelo in Las Vegas. “I am looking forward to Saturday night and I never think about judges. I don’t say: ‘Oh, I’m in Vegas, against Canelo, everything against me. No.’” The shadow of Canelo, and Putin, stretch across this contest but Bivol is a decent man and a very good fighter. “I just need to be my best version to be able to win,” he says before, with a smile and a handshake, he slips out of sight again.

5/6/2022,"Amber Heard continued her explosive counter-argument to Johnny Depp’s claim of defamation, telling jurors her former husband was surrounded by security guards and assistants who enabled him to avoid the consequences of his drug and alcohol issues. The court was shown photographs of Depp passed out, which Heard said she starting taking in 2013 because he would black out and later deny what had taken place when he was intoxicated. “He wouldn’t remember, or he would deny it. There was no one to back me up – just his employees versus my word,” Heard said. Heard later testified about a trip to London in 2013, where she and Depp were filming movies, when Depp disappeared and came home so intoxicated that he was carried into their rented home “like a baby” by a security guard. Heard testified: “His assistants and his assistants were shaking their heads. I remember thinking: surely this is it. He was very sick for at least two days. I felt at that juncture very encouraged that we were on the same page … that he had hit rock bottom. “I understood enough about addiction to know you have to hit rock bottom, have some consequence to get better.” Depp, she added, got briefly sober. “I thought we were on a good path to sobriety,” she said. “I felt very encouraged that everybody and I were on the same page, and I felt encouraged that we were in a new chapter,” Heard added. But Depp soon relapsed, she said. The court was told that Depp and Heard’s father ran out of drugs at the couple’s engagement party, and her father left the party with Depp’s security team to pick up more. Heard has previously testified about her father’s heroin addiction. Heard testified that she had insisted on pre-nuptial agreement. “I wanted to eliminate any doubt in his mind and in other people’s minds. So I brought it up to him and brought it up to my therapist,” she said. But Depp, she said, had ruled it out. “He accused me of having one foot out,” Heard said, and told her “the only way out of this is death”. Heard said that Depp would become angry if any of her movies were scripted with sex scenes. She said: “Every time I got a script, it was what kind of, you know, how I was dressing? … Did I have a sex scene?” Heard said she compensated for his jealousy by declining more sexually provocative parts or petitioning wardrobe managers to allow her to dress more conservatively. “I had to eggshell or tip-toe around him when I had any kind of scene,” Heard said of the conflict. Depp, she said, hated that she worked with James Franco in The Adderall Diaries and had kicked her in the back on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles. “He called me a slut” for the scenes, Heard said, adding how he accused her of liking filming the scenes. “He was being really explicit about my body, about how I liked it. He called me go-getting, a slut. He asked if I was wet, why I wasn’t looking at him … did James do this and that to me?” The jury heard Depp “howling like an animal” in an audio recording recorded by Heard on the flight. Depp, Heard said, had locked himself in the bathroom and passed out. After the Met Gala in New York, Heard testified, Depp had thrown a bottle at her. She told the court: “He shoved me down on the sofa and at some point he just whacked me in the face. I suspected I had a broken nose. I remember it being swollen, discolored and red.” Heard testified that a team of detox doctors was brought into help Depp after the LA-Boston flight. The doctors elected to keep Depp on painkillers so he could finish filming, she said. But Depp, Heard said, was taking “about double” the number of opiate painkillers he told his doctors he was taking. Depp, Heard said, would “nod out” or fall asleep in mid-sentence. “He’d been lying to them so he could get extra-high before he had to detox,” Heard testified. “I didn’t understand what was going on,” Heard said. “I hadn’t seen anything like this. I was trying to figure what happened.” In 2014, Heard said she started attending daily meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, a 12-step group for family members of people with addiction. Eventually, Heard said, Depp agreed to a detox programme under the care of a team at his home in Bahamas. But the process did not go smoothly, she said. “He slapped me across the face, but he did so while he was crying,” Heard said. “I shouldn’t have been there. I don’t know how to detox someone. I don’t know why the doctors and nurses wanted me to be there. It was hell.” The court is out Friday and all of next week, leaving jurors 10 days to mull Heard’s testimony before Depp’s counsel can mount a cross-examination.",News/US news,"Johnny Depp’s entourage enabled drug and alcohol use, Amber Heard testifies",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/amber-heard-johnny-depp-testimony-defamation-trial
5/6/2022,"Ministers have been “slow” to tackle systematic racism and racial inequality during the pandemic, and persist in trying to “explain away” disproportionality in death rates, the head of the Covid-19 public inquiry has been told in a leaked letter from black, Asian and minority ethnic leaders. The government published its draft terms of reference for the inquiry in March, and stated that the main topics would be the response to the pandemic and its impact in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The inquiry would also produce a factual narrative account of what happened. When will the inquiry begin? When Heather Hallett was named chair of the statutory public inquiry into Covid-19 in December 2021, the government said it would “begin its work in spring 2022”. Five months on, the areas it will cover have not been confirmed by the prime minister and Lady Hallett is assessing public consultation responses before making a recommendation to Boris Johnson. The inquiry’s substantive hearings, with witnesses giving evidence in person, are not expected to start until 2023. What will it cover? The inquiry is into the “preparations and the response to the pandemic in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland”. It will also produce a factual narrative account. The Scottish government has announced its own inquiry into matters it governs under the terms of devolution. Have they been more specific than that? Yes. The list of topics to be covered in the draft terms of reference extends to 26, split into three categories: central, devolved and local public health decision-making and its consequences; the response of the health and care sector across the UK; and the economic response to the pandemic and its impact, including government interventions. Individual topics include preparedness, lockdowns, testing, borders, infection control in hospitals and care homes, PPE, vaccines, furlough and sick pay. How long will it take? Lawyers are expected to poreover millions of documents, and some experts believe it will be the biggest public inquiry yet in terms of disclosure. The breadth of institutions involved and the number of people bereaved by Covid also make it likely that hearings could take several years. For comparison, the Grenfell Tower public inquiry hearings are on course to take more than four years. Robert Booth However, the absence of a specific programme of work investigating how racial inequality and racism affected millions of Britons over the last two years has sparked anger – and prompted half a dozen leaders to raise their concerns directly with Heather Hallett, the chair of the inquiry. In the letter to Lady Hallett, seen by the Guardian, the leaders say they are worried because the draft terms of reference do not contain any direct focus on the “significant inequalities” experienced by ethnic minorities “as a result of systematic racism throughout the pandemic”. This is especially alarming, they say, because “the effects of Covid-19 on race equality are likely to be long-term”. The letter is signed by Jabeer Butt, the chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation; Charles Kwaku-Odoi, the chief officer of the Caribbean and African Health Network; and Circle Steele, the chief executive of the Wai Yin Society, among others. A consultation was opened into the draft terms of reference, and contributions were sought from the public, bereaved families, professional bodies, and support groups. Hallett is now assessing those views and considering whether to recommend any changes to Boris Johnson. She is expected to inform the prime minister of her views this month. The letter urges Hallett “to consider not only the differing experiences of communities, but the experience of racism that increased the risks faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic communities during the pandemic as a specific programme of work within this inquiry. “A range of community voices and robust academic evidence shows that black, Asian and minority ethnic people have experienced significant inequalities as a result of systemic racism throughout the pandemic both in general and across the main areas of focus for the inquiry. For instance, there is continued disproportionality in deaths and infections for black, Asian and minority ethnic people.” It says there has been “clear disproportionality” in the deaths of black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare staff. “For instance, 21% of all staff are black, Asian or minority ethnic but 63% of healthcare workers who died were black, Asian or minority ethnic.” The leaders, who also include Zeenat Jeewa, the chief executive of the Asian People’s Disability Alliance, and Denis Onyango, the programmes director of the Africa Advocacy Foundation, say it is “important to note” that black, Asian and minority ethnic workers in other sectors were also “disproportionately affected by the pandemic”, including in business, housing and policing. “Worryingly, the government response to growing evidence of racial inequality in the experience of infection and mortality was slow and then attempted to explain away evidence of disproportionality,” the letter adds. “Unfortunately, the government’s desire to explain away racial inequality has persisted in the face of eminent public health experts, such as Sir Michael Marmot, highlighting that racism was one of the ‘causes of the causes’.” Hallett is urged to set out a “clear plan” to secure testimony from people in black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and examine “what could be done to protect them from future pandemics”. The Cabinet Office said in March that the inquiry would aim to understand the experiences of those most affected by the pandemic, as well as looking at any disparities in its impact. However, the leaders urge Hallett to “demonstrate independence from the government by focusing on racism and racial inequality and not ‘disparities’ in understanding what needs to change to ensure that future public health emergencies do not once again disproportionately impact black, Asian and minority ethnic communities”.",News/UK news,UK government accused of ‘explaining away’ Covid race issues,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/uk-government-accused-of-explaining-away-covid-race-issues
5/6/2022,"Hello darkness my old friend. As Pep Guardiola walked on to the pitch at the final whistle in the Bernabéu, a familiarly skinny-legged figure, that gleaming bald pate looking terribly tender under the hard white lights, still dressed head to toe in tailored black like a celebrity magician, or a university lecturer on his way to a funeral, it was hard not to feel the pathos of the moment. Guardiola shook hands, patted his players and said something to the referee. He lingered near the centre circle, facing down the waves of triumphalism from the seats, in an arena where this really is personal, where Guardiola stands as a gargoyle of deep tribal rivalries. Often managers use that post-match lull as a buffer before their media duties, a moment to compose their thoughts and prepare a face to meet the faces. This was a crushing night for Guardiola, one of those moments around which a career is defined, horizons reeled in. But City have another game on Sunday, with another prize on the line. Guardiola knew this was a moment to swallow it down. A little later he would tell his press conference that he had at no point seen defeat coming, or had any idea Real Madrid were capable of turning a game like this. Really? Because it was out there in plain sight. In the press seats one Spanish football correspondent had flagged up that defeat was coming to Manchester City even as they dominated possession early on, growing ever more certain of Madrid’s eventual victory as Riyad Mahrez put City 1-0 up on the night. And while this may be a familiar pattern for those who have studied this Madrid team at close range, the question remains: how did City manage to lose this game? There will be talk of magic, of Madrid’s own sun king powers. There is no doubt that the Bernabéu will stretch you thin, will test your upstart nerve. Paris Saint-Germain collapsed under that gaze. Chelsea came here and won but somehow still lost, or lost just enough. That talk of light and heat seemed to tell the story in the moment. This was of course Madrid’s win more than City’s defeat, carried off with thrilling, nerveless precision. But the fact remains, it also raises some very difficult questions for Guardiola. Madrid will seek out your limitations, and will jump on them gleefully. This is what that rarified air does to you. What they found in this City team wasn’t the standard errors of poor planning or bungled execution, but something more systemic, flaws built into the model. There is an annual spring pantomime around Guardiola’s team selection in this competition. What will he do? Will he jam a screwdriver into his own fusebox again? Or try to play the piano in a pair of boxing gloves? But there was none of that here. Guardiola picked his best team, and at times that best team looked like what it is, a beautifully fluid thing utterly committed to its patterns and rhythms. But there are limitations here too. Guardiola has been feted, rightly, as the best pure coach in the world. He misses nothing in preparation. He knows, to an unguessable depth of detail, the textures and patterns the rest of us simply watch from the sidelines. This is what makes his willingness to accept his team’s weaknesses so fascinating. Why didn’t City win? Because they kept on refusing to kick or head the ball into the goal, missing at least eight very good chances in a tie they lost by one goal. This is not bad luck or an off-day. This is profligacy by design. It is still startling that Guardiola’s squad doesn’t contain a single player whose chief skill, whose specialism, is scoring goals. And yes, City function so well as a team precisely because they don’t play with an orthodox striker. It is the overload in midfield that allows them to create all these chances in the first place. The system works. But pragmatism is also a strength, and that lack of cutting edge, of a one-punch knockout artist, while intellectually uninteresting to Guardiola, is a weakness in these moments. More prosaically, City’s players just looked tired on Wednesday night. The squad has depth, but not much depth. It feels like another part of Guardiola’s absolutism that the same core have tended to play most key games. The same refusal to bend was there in his use of his subs at the Bernabéu. Early on it seemed the story of the night might be Kyle Walker’s fine performance curtailing the menace of Vinícius Júnior. Instead City lost the game after Walker’s injury. Guardiola brought on Oleksandr Zinchenko to play left-back and swapped João Cancelo, rejigging both his full-backs in the cause of remaining decisively Pep. Bringing on Nathan Aké would have acknowledged this was a moment to contain and spoil, to spend 18 minutes damning up that side. Both of Madrid’s late goals came from those loosened flanks. It might seem perverse to find fault with a systems team playing like a systems team; to urge the current group of serial league champions to junk all that stuff and go for the throat. But knockout football at this level also takes you into these strange emotional spaces. A team that try to chase down the same perfect game every week will at times play cold when they need to play hot, just as City never really dug their teeth into this second leg. Perhaps that fragility is also a function of where the club has come from. It’s not an insult to state this City team is a construct. Guardiola’s success has been to install culture and method into something that is just over a decade old. It’s new-build, a prefab, an idea. No surprise, perhaps that it doesn’t bend with the wind like Real Madrid. For Guardiola the challenge now is to ensure his players are ready to chase the season to the end, when one slip in their remaining four league games could leave them with no trophy this season. Guardiola also has a shelf life. He has had six years now working in an environment tailored entirely to his wishes. It is no secret the Champions League, no matter how distant and how difficult, has always been the goal. The chief failing of Wednesday night is that it really didn’t feel any closer.",Sport/Football,Guardiola’s lack of flexibility leaves City no closer to European glory | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/guardiolas-inflexibility-leaves-manchester-city-no-closer-to-european-glory
5/6/2022,"Two men funnelled bribes totalling millions of pounds to a Saudi prince and other high-ranking officials to secure lucrative commercial contracts, the opening day of a trial has heard. The Serious Fraud Office alleged that a total of £9.7m was paid to Prince Miteb bin Abdullah and a group of senior Saudi officials to land the contracts for a British subsidiary of the European aerospace group Airbus. Mark Heywood, QC for the prosecution, said that British middlemen had regularly paid bribes to “highly placed” Saudis for years through offshore companies and Swiss bank accounts in what amounted to “deep corruption”. Jeffrey Cook, 65, and John Mason, 79, are accused of making the corrupt payments to the senior Saudis between 2007 and 2012 as an inducement or reward for favouring the British firm GPT Special Project Management. Cook faces a second charge of misconduct in public office between 2004 and 2008. He is accused of taking kickbacks while he was an employee of the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD). Cook and Mason have pleaded not guilty. The trial at Southwark crown court in London heard that GPT had been given a key role in a longstanding arms deal that had been struck by the British and Saudi governments. On Thursday, Heywood told Mr Justice Bryan that the payments to Miteb and seven other Saudi officials and agents were disguised through opaque records. They did “nothing legitimate to justify the payments”, he alleged. He said the payments were made to induce the Saudis to give GPT substantial contracts that entailed installing and maintaining communications equipment for a Saudi military unit. The contracts were run under a formal agreement between the UK and Saudi governments that dated back to the 1970s. Heywood said the MoD had a “significant involvement” in the agreement. The MoD was responsible for approving payments as part of it. Cook worked for the MoD for more than 30 years. The court heard that in 2006 he was helping to manage the military contracts under the agreement. Heywood alleged that when questions were being asked around that time about the payments, Cook received kickbacks totalling tens of thousands of pounds and three cars, which in effect doubled his civil service salary, to deflect attention from the purported bribes. Cook later went on to be the managing director of GPT, where he approved substantial bribes, according to Heywood. Heywood alleged that the bribes were paid through an offshore company, Simec, based in the Cayman Islands, that was part-owned by Mason. He accused Mason, an accountant, of authorising the bribes to the Saudis, adding that he and Cook had “their hands on the levers of the mechanism” to make the illicit payments. The QC told the court that the payments were portrayed as being paid to individuals for their advice and assistance on the contracts. In reality, however, he said, the payments were going to middlemen and then passed on to senior Saudis to ensure that the contracts were, and continued to be, awarded to GPT. He alleged that 12% of revenues received by GPT “went out of the door” to pay off the Saudis in payments that were labelled “bought in services”. The amount of money paid in bribes was larger than the profits accrued by GPT, according to Heywood. The SFO started its investigation in 2012 after two whistleblowers alleged that bribes were being paid. The trial, which is expected to last two months, continues.",News/UK news,"UK middlemen paid £9.7m in bribes to Saudis for contracts, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/uk-middlemen-saudis-contracts-southwark-crown-court
5/6/2022,"Essex have been hit with a £50,000 fine by the Cricket Discipline Commission after an investigation into allegedly racist language used by the former chair John Faragher during a board meeting five years ago. Faragher has denied using an expression with the N-word in 2017 but, after the matter was investigated by the England and Wales Cricket Board’s disciplinary arm in response to a whistleblower coming forward last year, the club pleaded guilty to two breaches of the ECB’s directives. These relate to directive 3.3 – an act or omission that may be prejudicial or bring the game into disrepute – and cover the terminology allegedly used by Faragher and the club’s failure to address the issue at the time. Faragher has since stood down as chair, along with seven other board members. The CDC panel, headed by Ricky Needham, alongside Amrisha Parathalingam and Mark Milliken-Smith QC, announced the sanction on Thursday. The £50,000 fine, which took into account the club’s subsequent apology and “restatement of its commitment against discrimination”, includes £15,000 suspended for two years. In the full CDC ruling, which included Essex being cautioned as to their further conduct and reprimanded, it said: “The use of racist and discriminatory language such as this is plainly unacceptable: it’s utterance by a club chair is all the more deplorable. “It is clear that the club has failed to uphold the standards expected of it, not only in respect of the conduct of its former chair, but also as regards its failure to act appropriately or at all thereafter.” Essex said: “The club has a zero-tolerance policy towards racism and any form of discrimination. We continue to work with the ECB to eradicate discrimination from the game, which includes implementing their 12-point action plan and the club’s further commitment to equality, diversity & inclusion policies and processes.” While the sanction may draw a line through Faragher’s reported transgression, the club is still investigating allegations of historical racism brought forward by three former players last year after Azeem Rafiq’s explosive testimony in parliament regarding his time at Yorkshire.",Sport/Sport,"Essex fined £50,000 for racist comment made by former chair in 2017",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/05/essex-fined-50000-comment-former-chair-2017-ecb
5/6/2022,"This government’s despicable assault on asylum seekers and refugees – and the distress caused for our union’s members in the Home Office – is seemingly endless. From pushbacks in the Channel to shipping people off to Rwanda, the cruelty is unimaginable, but as so often is the case with this Tory government and those that came before it, the cruelty is the point. In the face of this inhumanity, I am incredibly proud that my union, PCS, and others are taking a stand. Clearly this is an annoyance to a cynically vote-seeking prime minister and his allies, as is evident from the front page of today’s Daily Mail, which warns of the plan being threatened by “liberal lawyers”. But the plan is dreadful, and there are reasons aplenty to fight it. Last month, the Home Office climbed down from its intention to operate a pushback policy in the Channel. This was in response to a judicial review application made by PCS and Care4Calais, alongside other applications from two other refugee groups, Freedom from Torture and Channel Rescue. We were compelled to get involved because the pushback policy posed a considerable threat to the lives of refugees and the inhumane treatment they would be subjected to. It also carried risks to our members’ safety and wellbeing, exposing them as it did to risk of death, injury, trauma and prosecution if something went disastrously wrong. We have been thoroughly vindicated by the outcome. The home secretary was forced into a humiliating retreat: the Home Office has withdrawn the policy in its entirety and has agreed to pay all our costs. We were all thrilled with this result, but the defeat of the pushback policy does not signal the end of the government’s assault on refugees, or the consequences for our members tasked with implementing these policies. With the announcement of the policy to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda, coupled with the nationality and borders bill recently becoming law, the government has made it perfectly clear that it intends to create an even more hostile working environment for refugees and our members. Our members are up in arms about the appalling Rwanda plans, and rightly so. This is a workforce that sees the terrible effects of these policies on desperate people, and one that has long been used as a political football as successive governments have lurched from one disaster on asylum and immigration policy to another. Our members are always the ones that have to deal with the disastrous consequences and are left to pick up the pieces. The Windrush scandal was a case in point. As we did in the pushback case, this union intends to do all it can to stop our diligent public servants being placed in this unjust position once more. We have again joined forces with Care4Calais, alongside Detention Action, to begin legal proceedings. We have also served a pre-action letter on the home secretary seeking the disclosure and publication of the criteria for determining the suitability of asylum seekers for removal to Rwanda. We are acting swiftly to prevent illegal deportations and protect both our members and those directly affected. All the signs of a reckless, inhumane, ill-considered policy are there. Our negotiators in the Home Office have requested policy and operational documents – but none have been forthcoming. We were forced to follow a similar process in the pushback case where those documents that were provided were heavily redacted. It can only be concluded that either the Rwanda policy announcements are built on sand and no policy framework exists to facilitate it, or they have something to hide. If it is the former, this pathetic government is using the plight of oppressed people to score cheap political points; if it is the latter, we should all be deeply troubled. It is only right that the legality of what is being proposed is subject to scrutiny – that is what the apparatus of legal scrutiny is for – and we have made it clear to the government that they are required to exercise its discretionary powers transparently. In another important step, we have been given an assurance by the home secretary that no action will be taken to remove any individual refugee to Rwanda before we receive a response to our letter. We will seek to extend that assurance until the legality of the proposals has been tested. The government backed down on the eve of the trial on the pushback policy because it feared it was going to lose – again. In the last five years we have won four judicial reviews against the government, and on each occasion, the government has been found to have been in breach of the law. We are confident that, had it seen the inside of a courtroom, the pushback case would have made it five. We are treating the government’s claims that the Rwanda policy is legal with a significant degree of scepticism. We believe the government’s record completely justifies that scepticism. We have already had one stunning victory, but for the sake of our members and the desperate people coming to the UK, and the rule of law, we will not stop there.

If they cannot soar like single-minded salmon to claim a high ball under intense pressure they will not last long and their team will win nothing.

On paper Hugo Keenan will have his work cut out this weekend compared to his Leicester counterpart Freddie Steward, the 6ft 5in skyscraper swiftly establishing himself as one of the world game’s safest pair of aerial hands. Which will suit the 25-year-old Dubliner just fine. To underestimate Keenan, as plenty of opponents are finding, is an increasingly big mistake. Because it is not just a case of how high full-backs can jump or how tall they are. What matters even more is the consistent ability to be in the right place at the right time and to defuse potential danger with minimal fuss. Keenan, some four inches shorter than Steward, is a prime example of someone whose error rate is so low he often goes largely unnoticed. A classic late developer who did not make the first team at Blackrock College until his final year, Keenan is not the boastful type himself but he is fast becoming one of the first names on the teamsheet for both his province and country. While the Tigers can be relied upon to kick high and often towards the Leinster back three in their Champions Cup quarter-final at Welford Road on Saturday they will not find the aerial contest an easy win. For a start Keenan has already been given a taste of what to expect during Ireland’s 32-15 win over a 14-man England at Twickenham in the Six Nations. “Marcus Smith was trying to play a pressure game, similar to what Leicester will probably bring this weekend. They like to put pressure on teams and George Ford will kick a lot.” He also points out that Leinster can put judicious boot to ball themselves. “You have to be realistic about your odds of winning the ball against the likes of Freddie Steward when there is a contestable kick. But if it’s a good kick and a good chase I know myself how hard it is to take any ball if it is on the money and there is good pressure. We won’t shy away from it but we’ll also try and vary it as well.” Keenan’s personal high ball heroes were Rob Kearney and Leigh Halfpenny but he has already seen enough of the 21-year-old Steward to be genuinely impressed. “He’s probably the best in the world at the moment in that area. He’s obviously got the 6ft 5in frame but he’s dynamic as well … always jumping up through the ball and really attacking it. He’s brave as well so it’s a good combination. He’s one of Leicester’s key players and his chemistry and connection with George Ford is one of the reasons why they’re going so well. I’m looking forward to the challenge.” One slight handicap could be Leicester’s battle-hardened edge from their recent Premiership exertions while Leinster’s main men sat out their side’s recent visit to South Africa and will have scant time to adjust to a potentially raucous east Midlands atmosphere. Keenan, though, believes Leinster are braced for whatever is coming and will be fiercely motivated by past knockout disappointments against Saracens and La Rochelle. “With the squad we have, looking back on the last year and the year before we were hugely disappointed not to go on and win it. All the focus is on this year. If not now, when? “We always say that European club rugby, especially in the knockout stages, is the highest intensity and physicality you’re going to play. It’s those sort of tests that really do match an international. We’ll need to bring our best performance because, ultimately, that’s what’s going to be needed to win over there. Nothing but the best.”",Sport/Sport,Hugo Keenan relishes aerial battle as Leinster and Leicester look to take flight,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/05/hugo-keenan-relishes-aerial-battle-leinster-leicester-european-rugby-union-champions-cup
5/6/2022,"Formula One will revel in its new found success in the US at this weekend’s Miami Grand Prix. The sport is resurgent in the country F1 has long wanted to break and a key factor has been the popularity of the Netflix documentary series Drive to Survive. Little wonder then that the streaming service chose Miami as the backdrop to announce the series has been recommissioned for a further two seasons. F1 is holding two races in the US for the first time since 1984, with Miami and the US GP in Austin. Next year it will add Las Vegas to the mix. The sport’s owners, Liberty Media who took over F1 in 2017, have made no secret of their ambition to build F1’s profile in the US, and Drive to Survive has been vital. Team principals have acknowledged the part the TV show has played in bringing their sport to a wider audience, even while some drivers such as Max Verstappen have criticised that it is played for dramatic effect to sell a narrative. Verstappen has a point but the format unquestionably chimes with viewers. In Miami the American former world champion Mario Andretti emphasised the part the series had played in revitalising interest in his home country. “It was always said that F1 was the Olympics of motor racing and it was well received, always respected in every way but it’s picked up a new fervour now,” he said. “Especially the way it was exposed in Drive to Survive. That’s rekindled something but also brought on some new interest which is good, it’s fabulous for the sport.” The series was launched in 2018 and season four, which premiered this year, attracted its biggest audience yet, achieving the Netflix top 10 status in 56 different countries. The audience growth watching the sport in the US has been steady since then and crucially is hitting the younger demographic F1 wants to attract. Drive to Survive is made by the Box to Box production company and Paul Martin is its founder and producer of the series. “When we went to the Austin GP it really hit home,” he said. “Attendance had gone up and tickets sold out in record time and people in hotels and at the track just kept referencing the show. The actual point was probably when a woman from Texas came up and told me her favourite driver was Esteban Ocon and I thought: ‘Wow, this show has really broken through’.” Martin paid tribute to the sport itself and Netflix as being fundamental in driving the surge. “It has young, good looking guys, driving fast cars in amazing locations,” he said. “Behind it all you have powerful people and brands fighting it out. We used to joke in the early days that it was Game of Thrones in fast cars. “It was the sport, our story telling and Netflix played a huge role as well. They put it in front of households that probably never would have found it on a traditional broadcaster.” On the opening weekend of this season the Bahrain GP was held on the same day as Nascar Cup and IndyCar races. Adam Stern of the Sports Business Journal kept track of the viewing figures. Nascar picked up just over 4m viewers, F1 1.3m and Indycar 954,000. The sport is broadcast by ESPN in the US and this was F1’s second highest audience figures on cable TV after the 1995 Brazilian GP. It was up by almost 400,000 on the 2021 season opener. ESPN has enjoyed increasing ratings since it took over broadcasting F1 in 2018 moving from an average of 554,000 that year to 927,000 in 2021, yearly rises tallying with the growth in popularity of each subsequent series of Drive to Survive. Filming is already under way for season five of Drive to Survive and will continue this weekend. “It’s amazing to see the buzz around F1 at the moment,” said Martin. “I think Miami is going to be the pinnacle of that.”",Sport/Sport,Drive to Survive documentary helping bring in new generation of US F1 fans,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/05/drive-to-survive-documentary-helping-bring-in-new-generation-of-us-f1-fans
5/6/2022,"YouTube is showing videos that promote skin-bleaching, weight loss, drug culture and firearms to children as young as two, a new investigation of the company’s “Kids” app has found. YouTube Kids, an app and website released in 2015, is supposed to be a safer, curated version of the video-sharing website aimed at children under 13. It tailors content to three age groups: “older”, “younger” and “preschool”, roughly corresponding to those aged nine to 12 years old, four to seven, and under four. The company says it ensures that the videos on the service are family-friendly through “a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online”. But, it cautions users “no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through”. Research from the Tech Transparency Project, a US-based non-profit, shows that the system is indeed far from perfect. Using three different accounts, each set to one of app’s age groups, the analysts discovered numerous videos that should not have made it past Google’s filters. A Breaking Bad-themed cooking show, for instance, in which the hosts dress up in respirators and make jokes about the risk of inhaling the fumes, might be light-hearted viewing for adults or teens, but has been categorised by YouTube as being appropriate for “younger children” – as has a Minecraft project to recreate the RV, “where the crystal meth is cooked”, from the hit show. Songs sometimes slip mature themes into the children’s app, too. Eric Clapton’s Cocaine – sample lyric “When your feeling is gone, and you wanna ride on, cocaine” – is available to children as young as five as part of a guitar tuition series. Content aimed at gun users slips through the net, leading to younger children being shown a ranking of recoil pads, which protect shooters from the kickback of a firing gun, and older children being offered step-by-step instructions on how to build a shelf with a hidden compartment to conceal a pistol. Most alarming was content for kids that could lead to harmful body image issues. A popular Indian beauty influencer’s post on how to apply skin-bleaching products was available for older kids, while even preschool children were shown a cartoon about the importance of burning calories to lose weight, which exhorted them to “wiggle your jiggle”. “YouTube Kids is geared specifically to young children, even toddlers,” said Katie Paul, TTP’s director. “This is a product that, YouTube claims, does a lot of machine learning to filter out harmful content. It’s very specifically meant to be safe for children, and we didn’t expect to find the variety of inappropriate content that we did find.” “The most shocking thing, for me personally, was seeing a lot of the drug-related content,” she added. “Of course, these aren’t pushing drugs – but a show like Breaking Bad, which is definitely meant for adults, is being mimicked to push rock candy as though it’s ‘baked meth’ using a lot of drug phrases.” In a statement, a YouTube spokesperson said: “We built YouTube Kids to create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving parents the tools to customise the experience for their kids. We have a higher bar for which videos can be a part of the app and also empower parents to control what content their child can and cannot see. Upon review we have removed or age-gated a number of the flagged videos from the Kids app.” Paul argued that the results showed “that algorithmically curated content should not be marketed for kids. This is just another example of the fact that even when a company says they’re putting their strongest efforts towards protecting children towards curating this content, we’re still seeing harms getting through to some of the most vulnerable populations”. The UK and EU have led the way globally in regulating services like YouTube kids, Paul added, but she said US Congress needed to do its part. She said: “Ultimately, we are talking about American companies. And it is US Congress that should be leading the way in developing stronger regulations to ensure that these companies are not causing harm to children.”",News/Technology,YouTube Kids shows videos promoting drug culture and firearms to toddlers,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/05/youtube-kids-shows-videos-promoting-drug-culture-firearms-toddlers
5/6/2022,"St Paul’s Cathedral is to admit girls to its internationally renowned choir, breaking with a tradition stretching back 900 years. The move comes 31 years after Salisbury became the first Anglican cathedral in England to offer girls places in its choir. Many others, including York Minster, Durham and Exeter, have followed suit. St Paul’s choir performs at services and events of national importance as well as daily liturgies and three times on Sundays. It will perform at a service of thanksgiving next month for the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations. The choir currently comprises 22 choristers alongside professional singers known as vicars choral. The first girls will join in 2025 after boarding school facilities have been expanded and funds raised for scholarships. Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, said: “I am delighted by the chapter [governing body] decision to welcome girls into the cathedral choir. The choir plays a key role in the worship not just of the cathedral but of the whole diocese. It will be wonderful to hear girls’ voices contributing to this.” Andrew Carwood, the director of music at St Paul’s, said: “Knowing that our incredible boys will be joined by young girl choristers in the near future is heartwarming, and an important milestone in the choir’s history.” He said the “longheld ambition” to introduce girls had been put on hold by the Covid pandemic and resulting loss of income. “Now we’re getting our mojo back, and one of the first things is to get girls into the choir.” According to the Traditional Cathedral Choir Association, “the ecclesiastical all-male voice choir is a hugely significant part of our heritage” that has been valued for centuries. However, “a myriad of pressures has seen many of our historic traditional choirs lost” over recent years, it adds. At St Paul’s there will be separate boys’ and girls’ lines, which will perform together at major services. “I accept the idea of a boys’ choir as culturally iconic, and I’d like to keep that. And I’d like girls to be able to experience exactly the same thing,” Carwood said. “Traditional is not being broken, it’s being developed. The cathedral music tradition has always moved and changed and developed. So we want to move it forward, but also to preserve, so the boys and the girls will have their own identity, their own traditions, their own style within what we do.” St Paul’s, an architectural masterpiece designed by Sir Christopher Wren after the previous building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, recorded a 90% fall in income in 2020, prompting fears that the cathedral may have to permanently close.",News/World news,St Paul’s Cathedral to admit girls to choir for first time in 900 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/st-pauls-cathedral-to-admit-girls-to-choir-900-years
5/6/2022,"The RSPB is urging the public to get their hands dirty this weekend and create mud pies to help endangered birds such as house martins, swifts and swallows get enough sludge to build their nests. A nine-day mini-heatwave is hitting the UK, which coincides with the return of migratory birds here to breed. Many of these birds have flown thousands of miles on their journey. But conservationists are concerned that the ground is getting so hard it could stop them from being able to make their nests. By leaving out dishes of mud mixed with water, or creating little puddles in the garden, the public can make a big difference, said Becca Smith, of the RSPB. “It’s the easiest thing that people can do to help these birds after they’ve flown all the way from Africa to our shores. Plus, a bit of mud pie-making is fun for the weekend.” Putting out dishes of fresh water will also provide drinking and bathing for a variety of birds. House martins – which require the most mud for nestbuilding – can mix water with soil themselves, which they then combine with things such as grass, feathers and vegetable fibres to make little cup nests under the eaves of houses. “Having the mud already created for them is the easiest option for these birds,” said Smith. “It’s a bit like getting a McDonald’s as opposed to having to go out and get all the ingredients yourself and trying to recreate a Big Mac.” Mud pies should not be too sloppy, but also should not dry out. Smith recommends checking them a couple of times a day to make sure they are still wet enough. She says it’s good to leave birds water and mud every year between March and May, especially if it is dry, because this is a very busy time of year for them. Some migratory birds have arrived later this year because there have been persistent easterly and north-easterly winds, which make it harder for them to fly northwards. According to Marco Petagna at the Met Office, UK temperatures are “several degrees above where they should be at this time of year”. In December 2021, swift and house martins joined the UK red list of endangered birds in the latest IUCN update. Swift populations have fallen by 58% since 1995. These migratory birds have suffered from the loss of nesting sites as old buildings are renovated, and also the loss of insects – their food supply. A UK study this week found flying insect numbers have plunged by 60% since 2004. The RSPB also recommends putting up artificial nests and boxes to provide more nesting opportunities for these birds, as well as creating insect-friendly gardens. Alexander Lees, senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester Metropolitan University, said the RSPB’s recommendations look useful. “More broadly, we need building regulations that mandate spaces for swifts and house martins, and to make sure that any nest boxes are cited appropriately on cooler and shady north or east-facing walls,” he said. “Given that the loss of insect abundance is likely to be strongly affected by artificial light at night, then we can all make the effort where possible to turn lights off, saving insects, their predators and saving on our energy bills. We need to stop stealing the darkness from the natural world.”",News/Environment,"Muck in to help nesting birds during UK heatwave, says RSPB",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/mud-water-to-help-nesting-migrating-birds-during-uk-heatwave-rspb-aoe
5/6/2022,"Maybe there would be fewer mental health crises (Editorial, 25 April) if priority was given to earlier diagnosis and treatment. For example, the main complication of the chronic condition generalised anxiety disorder is substance misuse. If patients with it were identified early and had specialised therapy, many cases of secondary depression and substance misuse could be prevented. Other conditions that may be missed or underdiagnosed include obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar 2, somatisation disorder and early psychosis. Early treatment could modify the course of the illness, and patients who are less unwell have more scope to understand and contribute to their treatment plan. We try to treat patients with physical illness this way, so why not patients with mental illness? Mental health problems don’t go away just because they are not diagnosed. On the contrary, if patients and families are not supported, the primary mental health problem can escalate, leading to self-neglect, self-harm, family conflict and wider community issues. The problem does not just lie with services; late presentation can occur because of the stigma surrounding mental health conditions, because of fear of the possible side effects of treatment, or the well-documented risks of hospital admission. Stigma and risk can be mitigated by patient advocacy and choice. The “no decision about me without me” standard should apply as far as is possible with mental health too. More expertise in mental health at the frontline and in primary care may help ensure that patients get the right treatment at the right time, and lead to better outcomes for all involved.Dr Anna StevensReading  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/6/2022,"Your editorial on the crisis in dentistry (2 May) is timely. However, to suggest “tooth loss mainly affects people later in life” glosses over the fact that child dental health is in a poor state. Dental caries are the most common reason for five- to nine-year-olds in England to be admitted to hospital. Over 60,000 children were admitted to hospital to have teeth removed in 2015-16. As Donna Ockenden pointed out in her review of maternity services, it is only with a robustly funded, well-staffed and trained workforce that safe and compassionate care can be delivered. This applies to all of the NHS, including dentistry. Sadly, the workforce planning amendment alluded to in the health and care bill was rejected. There has been no workforce plan for the NHS since 2003. The government would rather claim that its inadequate funding commitments are enough to solve all the NHS’s problems, whereas with 110,000 staff vacancies, ageing equipment and estate and rising demand there is no way that this can be true. Claims that the NHS has had record levels of funding without relating this to need are meaningless. If my pension went up by one penny a month I would have a record level of income, but not enough to compensate for inflation, price rises and the underfunding of public services that are chipping away at the social wage. It’s time to demand a public dental service that will end the decay.

5/6/2022,"Priti Patel has failed to disclose key documents to Home Office staff detailing how they should decide which migrants might be eligible to be removed to Rwanda, the leader of the UK’s biggest civil service union has claimed. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union that represents departmental staff and Border Force officers, said the home secretary’s decision to withhold framework documents explaining the government’s offshoring policy raises suspicions that it is “built on sand” and a cynical attempt to score “cheap political points”. In an article for the Guardian, Serwotka also pledged to back legal challenges against the policy on behalf of the Home Office staff who will be asked to deal with its “disastrous consequences”. It comes amid growing suspicion that the policy, announced last month amid the Partygate scandal, was ill-thought through and was expected by the government to be stalled in the courts. Boris Johnson on Wednesday attempted to blame “liberal lawyers” for delays in the implementation of the policy. Serwotka wrote that the government was asked last month to provide documents outlining the roles of union members who will be expected to implement the policy, but none have been disclosed. He said it follows a similar failure last year to fully disclose documents related to its failed pushback policy. “Our negotiators in the Home Office have requested policy and operational documents but none have been forthcoming. We were forced to follow a similar process in the pushbacks case where those documents that were provided were heavily redacted,” he wrote. He added: “It can only be concluded that either the Rwanda policy announcements are built on sand and no policy framework exists to facilitate it, or they have something to hide.” The government has pledged not to send anyone to Rwanda before responding to the union’s request, Serwotka said. “We have made it clear to the government that they are required to exercise its discretionary powers transparently. In another important step, we have been given an assurance by the home secretary that no action will be taken to remove any individual refugee to Rwanda before we receive a response to our letter. We will seek to extend that assurance until the legality of the proposals has been tested,” he wrote. Patel announced the policy last month after pledging a payment of £120m to the Rwandan government – a payment which does not cover flights, security or living costs. Under the plans, men and women who arrive in the UK on irregular routes would be processed in the UK. If not eligible for asylum, they could then be sent 4,500 miles to Kigali where they would be encouraged to settle in housing paid for by the UK. They would have no right to return to the UK and there is no formal appeals procedure to the UK’s decision. Last week, the Guardian disclosed that the PCS was one of four organisations challenging the policy in the courts. Johnson had said he wanted to send migrants to the authoritarian east African country before the end of May, but his spokesperson on Tuesday told reporters the programme would start “within months”. Speaking at Southampton airport, Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that the plans would be challenged in the courts, but defended the implementation. “Of course, there are going to be legal eagles, liberal lawyers, who will try to make this difficult to settle. We always knew this was going to happen, but is a very, very sensible thing,” he said. Serwotka wrote that after being part of a successful legal challenge against the government’s pushback policy, the union is backing a similar challenge against offshoring. “As we did in the pushbacks case, this union intends to do all it can to stop our diligent public servants from being placed in this unjust position once more,” he wrote. An analysis of government figures on Wednesday showed that 7,240 people had reached the UK in small boats from France in the four months since the start of 2022.",News/UK news,Union boss attacks Patel for withholding details about Rwanda migrants policy,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/union-boss-attacks-patel-for-withholding-details-about-rwanda-migrants-policy
5/6/2022,"Eight in 10 respondents in the largest survey of menopausal women in the UK said their workplace had no basic support in place and 41% said menopause symptoms were treated as a joke by colleagues. The landmark study found menopausal women were being ignored in the workplace and by healthcare providers, with a third saying it took many GP appointments before they were diagnosed with menopause or perimenopause. This rose to 45% for black and minoritised women. The findings were revealed in a report by the Fawcett Society, based on a survey of more than 4,000 women commissioned by Channel 4 for a documentary by Davina McCall. Of those surveyed, 44% said their ability to work had been affected by their symptoms, but the majority said their workplace had no support networks (79%), no absence policies (81%) and no information sharing with staff (79%). Other findings include 22% of disabled women leaving jobs due to their symptoms, compared with 9% of non-disabled women. Many women said they had taken time off due to menopause, but 39% cited anxiety or depression as the reason, rather than sharing their menopause status. “Menopausal women are experiencing unnecessary misery and it’s a national scandal,” said Jemima Olchawski, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society. “For too long, menopause has been shrouded in stigma. We need to break the culture of silence and ensure menopausal women are treated with the dignity and support they deserve instead of being expected to just get on with it.” Official guidance states hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be offered to women struggling with menopause symptoms, but there have been acute shortages of some HRT products and demand is expected to rise. The survey found 39% of women said their GP or nurse offered HRT as soon as they knew they were experiencing menopause, but only 14% of menopausal women said they were currently taking HRT. The majority of women (77%) reported at least one menopause symptom they found “very difficult”, while 44% of women said they experienced three or more symptoms of that severity. The most commonly reported symptoms were difficulty sleeping (84%), brain fog (73%) and anxiety or depression (69%). Almost half (45%) of respondents said they hadn’t spoken to their GP surgery about their symptoms due to stigma around the issue. “Too often menopause symptoms have been dismissed as a joke and HRT has been labelled a lifestyle drug,” said Olchawski. “Faced with that misinformation, is it a wonder that only half of women are even seeking help from their GP? “The government needs to make urgent changes, from requiring employers to have menopause action plans, to creating a route into menopause healthcare, to ensuring that GPs are adequately trained to spot menopause symptoms.” Recommendations in the report included implementing a public information campaign, with 87% of menopausal women agreeing that all women in their 40s or 50s should be sent a list of menopause symptoms by the NHS. It also suggested every woman in her 40s or 50s should be invited to speak with her GP about menopause and GPs should receive mandatory training to help earlier diagnosis.",News/Society,"Menopausal women lack basic support, landmark survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/menopausal-women-lack-basic-support-landmark-survey-finds

5/6/2022,"Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party, La République en Marche, is changing its name to Renaissance as the French president attempts to win a ruling majority in parliament for his second term in office. The party’s rebranding was announced just as campaigning was due to begin for June’s parliamentary elections. Macron is hoping to secure a parliamentary majority against competition from a new alliance of leftwing parties led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, which is seeking to increase its small number of seats. The name Renaissance meant “always choosing enlightenment over obscurantism”, its secretary general, Stanislas Guérini, told a press conference in Paris. Macron’s grouping had previously used the name Renaissance during its European election campaign in 2019. “Political parties have to reinvent themselves in order to continue to exist,” Guérini said, in a barbed reference to the poor presidential showing of the two former parties of government, the Socialists and Les Républicains, whose candidates Anne Hidalgo and Valérie Pécresse had a combined score of less than 7% in the presidential election last month, in which Macron beat the far-right Le Pen in the final. The name change was also intended to help Macron’s party gain ground in local government, which it has failed to do over the past five years. “It will be a party of the people, open to citizens,” Guérini said, saying all expertise was welcome, particularly from local elected officials who could join. Macron had created the political movement En Marche! (On the Move) in 2016 when he was economy minister, as a vehicle for his presidential bid in 2017. It was classed as “neither left nor right” and was presented at the time as deliberately unconventional. It used Macron’s own initials, EM, and had a handwritten logo that was Macron’s own writing, with no specific colour, unlike the rigid colours of the old party system. En Marche was then renamed La République En Marche – The Republic on the Move – for the 2017 parliamentary elections, where Macron won a majority. In next month’s parliament elections, the new Renaissance party will team up with two other centrist parties: its traditional allies in the MoDem party, which supported Macron in the presidential election, as well as the new Horizons party, set up by Macron’s former prime minister, Édouard Philippe. They will form a coalition under the banner Ensemble (Together). François Bayrou, head of the MoDem party, told the Paris press conference that the coalition of centrists shared a sense of the “seriousness” of the current mood of political “divisions” in France.

Asked about the implications for Taiwan he said: “We must collaborate with our allies and like-minded countries, and never tolerate a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by the use of force in the Indo-Pacific, especially in east Asia.” He added: “Russia’s egregious aggression against Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, which prohibits the use of force against a nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Earlier, Johnson said: “We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. “And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia.” The two countries have signed a mutual access agreement for their two forces, in part dedicated to keep the seas free and open. Kishida also announced new sanctions, including an asset freeze on 140 Russia individuals and the expansion of an export ban to include Russian military firms. The package was announced the day after Russia had imposed asset bans and travel freezes on 60 Japanese officials, including Japanese cabinet members and the prime minister himself. Kishida had described the Russian action as completely unacceptable. Kishida’s ruling Liberal Democratic party has recently proposed a substantial increase in defence spending – possibly to an amount on a par with 2% of gross domestic product, up from the current 1% – and the development of the capacity to attack missile-launching sites in an enemy’s territory. He said that, in the wake of the Russian invasion, he was trying to instil a crisis mentality in the Japanese people. Facing elections in July and rising energy prices that are squeezing voters’ budgets, Kishida said nuclear power would be a bigger part of the country’s future energy policy mix. He said Japan would address the “vulnerability of our own energy self-sufficiency” by broadening where it buys energy from, promoting renewables and using nuclear power to diversify its sources of generation. Japan has become more reliant on Russian gas since shutting down nuclear reactors after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, in which an earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown, devastating its north-eastern region. The country is reluctant to impose a ban on Russian oil imports. Kishida’s visit to London was the conclusion of a major trip that saw him visit Asean members Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Japan is chair of the G7 next year and Kishida is trying to rally east Asia into accepting that Russia’s actions, born of authoritarianism, represent a threat to stability, and, by extension, the region may have to resist China. Many countries in the region would prefer not to take sides in a contest between China and the US.",News/World news,Japanese premier warns of Ukraine-style invasion by ‘autocratic powers’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/japanese-premier-warns-of-ukraine-style-invasion-by-autocratic-powers
5/6/2022,"The new trailer for HBO’s much-anticipated Game of Thrones prequel, House of the Dragon, has been released. A teaser for the series, based on George RR Martin’s book Fire & Blood, reveals both the main cast and a look at some of the expensive world-building, with each episode estimated to cost around $20m. The story is set 200 years before the events of the original series, detailing the history of House Targaryen. Stars include Rhys Ifans, Olivia Cooke, Paddy Considine, Emma D’Arcy, Eve Best and Matt Smith. “This is something else, and should be something else,” co-showrunner Miguel Sapochnik said to the Hollywood Reporter last year. “It’s a different crew, different people, different tone. Hopefully, it will be seen as something else. But it will have to earn that – it won’t happen overnight. Hopefully, fans will enjoy it for the thing that it is.” Sapochnik, who also directed last year’s Tom Hanks sci-fi tale Finch, said he wants to “try and complement” the original show rather than reinvent it. Considine, who plays King Viserys Targaryen, has called it “the most demanding thing I’ve ever done”, while Cooke has said that, unlike the show’s predecessor, there won’t be graphic violence against women, something that drew controversy during earlier seasons. “I wouldn’t feel comfortable in being a part of anything that has just egregious graphic violence towards women for no reason whatsoever, just because they want it to be tantalizing in a way that gets viewers,” Cooke said to the Telegraph. “I was lucky enough to read the [prequel] script before, and it has changed a lot from the first few seasons. I don’t think they’d be in their right minds to include any of that any more.” Game of Thrones premiered on HBO in 2011 and over eight seasons became the company’s biggest show ever, winning 59 Emmys, a record for a drama series. After it ended in 2019, HBO was keen to extend the brand and ordered episodes of House of the Dragon, with other potential spin-offs nixed. Last year it was announced that a stage show based on Martin’s books would make its way to the UK, the US and Australia, revolving around the Great Tourney at Harrenhal. Martin has also signed a five-year, eight-figure deal with HBO for further projects. House of the Dragon starts on 22 August on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic and NOW in the UK.",Arts/Television & radio,New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel is released,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/game-of-thrones-prequel-trailer-house-dragon
5/6/2022,"The CIA director William Burns urged Jair Bolsonaro to stop questioning his country’s voting system, it has been claimed, amid growing fears the Brazilian president might refuse to accept defeat in this year’s election. Polls suggest Bolsonaro, a far-right populist famed for his adulation of Donald Trump, will struggle to secure a second term when about 150 million Brazilians head to the polls in October to choose their next leader. Bolsonaro’s leftist rival, the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is currently in pole position, and will formally announce his candidacy at a convention in São Paulo this weekend. The possibility of a Lula victory appears to have spooked Bolsonaro, who has ratcheted up his anti-democratic rhetoric in recent weeks, reviving baseless doubts over the reliability of Brazil’s electronic voting system. Such claims – part of a long-running Bolsonaro campaign to delegitimize the electoral process for political gain – have alarmed both Bolsonaro’s opponents and members of the international community. On Thursday, Reuters claimed that last year the CIA chief had told top Bolsonaro officials their president should stop casting doubt on Brazil’s voting system during an “intimate” private encounter in the capital, Brasília. When the meeting took place, in July last year, Bolsonaro hinted Burns’s visit was partly motivated by US concern over the political situation in neighbouring countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. However, Reuters claimed Burns had voiced concern over the situation in Brazil, telling two of Bolsonaro’s closest allies that “the democratic process was sacred, and that Bolsonaro should not be talking in that way” about the election. “Burns was making it clear that elections were not an issue that they should mess with,” one anonymous source told Reuters, insisting the comments had not constituted a lecture. Brian Winter, the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, said the initiative reflected genuine US concern. “Washington is worried about Bolsonaro subverting October’s election,” Winter tweeted. Some dismiss Bolsonaro’s attacks on Brazil’s voting system as meaningless bluster designed to fire-up his support base. During a recent visit to north-east Brazil, Bolsonaro elliptically told supporters they could be certain “the votes will be counted” and hinted they should buy themselves guns declaring: “An armed population will never be enslaved”. But there are clear signs of concern within the Brazilian establishment that, like Trump in November 2020, Bolsonaro might refuse to concede defeat with unpredictable consequences. Earlier this year Brazil’s top electoral authority invited European Union representatives to monitor the election – the first time such a request had been made. The invitation was reportedly withdrawn after pressure from Bolsonaro, but the fears persist. Natália Bonavides, a congresswoman for Lula’s Workers’ party (PT), warned against underestimating Bolsonaro’s pronouncements: “I think it’s a mistake to think anything Bolsonaro says is simply bravado.” Bonavides fears Bolsonaro could be paving the way for a South American version of the January 6 insurrection in Washington, when enraged Trump supporters stormed the Capitol after Joe Biden’s victory. “All you have to do is look at what happened in the United States to see how what is supposedly bravado can become action … and can even get people killed,” Bonavides said in a recent interview. “These are going to be hard, possibly violent elections – and what happens after them will be really important. Will the result be accepted? And, if we win, will there be a peaceful transition?” Bonavides asked.",News/World news,CIA director urged Bolsonaro to stop doubting Brazil’s voting system – report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/cia-director-bolsonaro-brazil-voting-system-election
