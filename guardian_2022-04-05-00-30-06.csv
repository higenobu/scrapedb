4/5/2022,"A stepfather accused of murdering a five-year-old had threatened to kill the boy if the child’s mother broke up with him, a jury has been told. John Cole, who is on trial for murdering Logan Mwangi, denied making the threat but admitted to striking the boy the day before he died and dumping his body on a riverbank. Giving evidence at Cardiff crown court on Monday, Cole accused his co-defendant, Angharad Williamson – his partner and Logan’s mother – of shaking him. He told the jury that after Logan’s death, he and Williamson put the boy, who was 1.04 metres (3ft 5in) tall, into a 67cm (2ft 2in) holdall and he took the bag out of the flat in the Welsh village of Sarn which the three shared. Cole, 40; Williamson, 30; and a 14-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, deny murdering Logan, whose body was found on 31 July last year, with more than 50 injuries. Under cross-examination from Williamson’s barrister Peter Rouch QC, Cole told how Logan had been confined to his room behind a stair gate because he had Covid, and was ordered to turn away from his mother and stepfather when they went in to give him meals. Cole said keeping Logan in isolation had caused tensions. Rouch asked Cole about an alleged row at the home two days before Logan’s death. He suggested Cole told the boy: “You think it’s funny we’re arguing over you, you won’t be happy until you split us up.” Cole replied: “No.” The barrister claimed that Cole, who is 1.93 metres (6ft 4in) tall and weighs between 14 and 15 stone, had “towered above” Logan and said “The only thing this boy understands is pain”, before hitting him twice in the stomach. Cole denied he had said those words and added: “I did not hit Logan in the stomach.” Rouch alleged Williamson had told Cole: “I’m going to leave you” and he had replied that he would kill the boy if she did. Cole claimed that Williamson had shaken him. Cole conceded that he had clipped Logan’s head the day before his body was found. “I am not proud of what I did but I have admitted what I have done,” he said. The defendant has told the court that Logan was already dead when he woke in the early hours of 31 July to the sound of Williamson screaming. Asked how Logan died, Cole said: “I don’t know what happened. I have heard a lot of stuff recently which is really disturbing and I don’t know how to make any sense of it.” He said he did not blame his co-defendants. Cole said he and Williamson put Logan’s body into a small Nike holdall. Rouch asked him if they had “crammed” the body in, given the size of the bag. Cole said he could not remember. He repeatedly said he left the body on the riverbank rather than in the water, where it was found. He said he regretted dumping Logan’s body. “It was disgusting and I deserve all I get for that.” The trial continues.",News/UK news,"Stepfather ‘threatened to kill Logan Mwangi if partner left him’, jury hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/04/stepfather-threatened-to-kill-logan-mwangi-if-partner-left-him-jury-hears
4/5/2022,"The world has only a narrow chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and is falling far behind on making the changes needed to transform the global economy to a low-carbon footing. Overshooting 1.5C is now “almost inevitable”, but the overshoot could be temporary and temperatures could be returned to 1.5C by the end of this century if countries seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically this decade. Technologies such as carbon dioxide removal are also likely to be needed, to limit and reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, and the world must reach net zero emissions by 2050. The world is currently planning far too many new coal-fired power plants, gas installations, and other fossil fuel infrastructure to stay within the carbon budgets needed to meet the 1.5C goal. While the IPCC holds open the door to technologies such as carbon capture and storage that could be used to neutralise emissions from new power plants, it makes it clear that the only realistic scenarios for keeping within 1.5C in the long term involve effectively phasing out coal use. Preserving the world’s existing forests, peatlands and other natural carbon stores must be a priority, and growing new forests and restoring soils and landscapes will be essential. But no amount of tree planting will be enough to cancel out the effects of continued fossil fuel emissions. Yes. The IPCC has made it clear that everything will need to change: energy, buildings, transport, food and industry. This will include “demand management”, or reducing our consumption, and demand for energy-intensive goods. Dietary changes, in particular eating less meat, will be needed to reduce methane in particular. But there are vast inequalities in consumption – the 10% of biggest emitters take up a disproportionate amount of global emissions, and they could still enjoy comfortable and even luxurious lifestyles while reducing their environmental impact. Investment is currently falling far short of the sums needed to transform the global economy, but the cost of most of the key technologies needed has plummeted in recent years, by as much as 85% for renewable energy. Investment must be increased at least sixfold to make the changes needed, but the costs will be manageable: by 2050, the costs will amount to a few percentage points of global GDP, and this does not take account of the sizeable additional benefits, in health and wellbeing. This is the third instalment of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report since 1988, covering ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It follows a first section published last August that warned human changes to the climate were becoming irreversible; and a second section published at the end of February warning of catastrophic impacts.",News/Environment,Final warning: what does the IPCC’s third report instalment say?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/final-warning-what-does-the-ipcc-third-report-instalment-say
4/5/2022,"The Split is back for a third and final season, and with it, the best tailoring on television. The family law drama is glossy, big and bold, and it has an air of unapologetic grandeur that is missing from a lot of television at the moment. Most big TV dramas, these days, have something of an earnest streak, but this BBC One series exists in its own lane, a glamorous grande dame adjusting her bosom as she wades into every betrayal and affair in a five-mile radius. It is irresistibly fun. The women of the Defoe family – matriarch Ruth and siblings Hannah, Nina and Rose – bring more melodrama to the table than most of their clients. It may be a legal drama, but this isn’t about courtroom showdowns and closing arguments that blow the whole case wide open. It’s about relationships of all stripes, and what happens when they reach breaking point. Ruth, Hannah and Nina are all in the family business, and help clients to navigate the choppy waters of death, divorce and parental responsibilities every day. Season two made the decision to mostly focus on one case, the slow unravelling of a marriage between two TV presenters, Fi and Richie, with a nasty undercurrent of coercive control. The Split deals in two moods. It is tense and almost thriller-esque, as various lies and affairs take place and are uncovered, or almost uncovered, and it is deeply satisfying when justice prevails. When the squirming Richie finally got his comeuppance, it was a punch-the-air moment, all the more deserved for the fact that it was allowed to play out as a full six-episode, season-long arc. As a legal firm, though, Noble Hale Defoe is a HR department’s worst nightmare. They’re all married, or shagging, or avoiding each other, or their clients. They are one formal complaint away from the office turning into an extremely middle-class episode of Open House: The Great Sex Experiment. On its website, the BBC describes The Split as a “steamy legal drama” and I suppose it is, but all that steaminess brings a lot of pain, and it has a sadistic side, when it comes to putting its leads through the mill. But the cast shoulders it well. Nicola Walker’s Hannah has a tendency towards self-sabotage that finally, inevitably caught up with her, when husband Nathan realised, at last, that she and Christie were more than just good friends. Not even Rebecca Adlington went swimming that often. It led to one of the best episodes of the entire series, when Stephen Mangan played out Nathan’s discovery with a sense of slow-dawning horror and humiliation, and Hannah started to wonder if Christie was what she had wanted after all. Walker and Mangan, together, were incredible. Nathan’s past affair, and history with an “adult” dating site, offered enough emotional complexity to keep me gripped. Who was in the wrong? It’s a sign of the show’s maturity and respect for its audience that nobody comes out of this covered in glory. Still, I’m not sure that emotional complexity is The Split’s main selling point. This is highly enjoyable escapism, the sort of show in which people say things like: “Someone said that you’re the best” to the lawyers, and there are lots of grisly arguments about technical terms and custody arrangements over vast tables, while everyone looks good in powerful businesswear. The houses and flats are covetable, London looks glamorous, and every now and then Anna Chancellor pops up as Melanie, a rival lawyer who almost always ruthlessly out-lawyers the rest of them. Season three begins on a strong footing, 10 months after the events of that juicy season-two finale, with plenty of thorny issues to resolve. Nathan and Hannah are divorcing, and at first it seems amicable, but this is The Split, after all, and it’s the split that has been coming since the very first episode, so naturally it isn’t all sweetness and agreements about who gets what from the Le Creuset collection. Nathan has hired Melanie for his side of the divorce, which is a masterful move. Christie has moved to New York. Nina is now a mother, and in recovery, though she is having an inappropriate affair, because she is Nina. Poor Rose, who isn’t a lawyer and so doesn’t get as much screen time, will, hopefully, find the happiness she deserves, simply for not being as messed up as everyone else. Will the rest get their acts together in time for The Split to bow out? I’m not counting on it, but that’s all part of the fun.",Arts/Television & radio,See you in court!

4/5/2022,"Deadlocked with cuddly north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 54 points but with two games in hand, Arsenal look to be in the box-seat to take fourth place and the place in Big Cup that comes with it next season. Look to be, except with the caveat they are Arsenal … albeit a version that has come a long way from the side that lost against Brentford on the opening night of the season. They went on to provoke much tittering among the punditocracy with defeats in their next two games, leaving them with a UK-at-Eurovision-esque “nul points” going into the season’s first international break. Well who’s laughing now, the Fiver might ask. And while the answer, as usual, will almost certainly be “not Fiver readers!”, we might also include Mikel Arteta, whose dogged insistence that we should all “trust in the process” has turned out to be correct. And where once that process might have seemed a mite indefinable, it turns out it involved nothing more complicated than getting a few well coached old pros and lots of exciting young tyros to gad about in a specific way. And last Thursday, following the return of his players from international duty, Arteta stressed the importance of getting their heads back in Arsenal’s particular game. “I will have them all here today, just try to refocus them – obviously, when they’re on international duty all the time they’re being asked to do different things, different roles, different kind of pressures,” Arteta trilled. “For some of them, it was their first international, so emotionally for them as well it’s very draining. And make sure that everyone is fine and look forward to the challenge that we have ahead.” With 10 challenges ahead for Arsenal before the end of the season, the first will be negotiated tonight at Selhurst Park, where the potential for Arteta and his players to Arsenal things up looks eminently possible. With their own occasionally brooding former Gunners midfielder in charge and no shortage of talented young whippersnappers among their ranks, Crystal Palace resemble a kind of Gooners-Lite. Comfortably ensconced in mid-table, they could actually be a lot higher were it not for their pre-Christmas predilection for failing to get the results their often excellent performances deserved. Indeed, one of those games at the Emirates, where it took a late, late Alexandre Lacazette strike to get the Gooners out of jail, left their visitors visibly deflated. “I was really disappointed to concede at the end because the players worked really hard and they deserved those three points,” said Vieira at the time. “I feel sorry for them today. In the second half, we had the desire to compete and won the ball quite high. This is the part of the game we wanted to improve, being aggressive. It’s part of the DNA of Crystal Palace.” And while not liking it up ‘em was once famously part of the DNA of Arsenal, even during the Vieira years, the current crop of players don’t seem to mind a tackle.

4/5/2022,"The evidence of atrocities by Russian troops as they retreat from central Ukraine is appalling. Denials and claims of fabrication out of Moscow are worthless. The alleged massacres in Bucha and elsewhere cannot be put down to the indiscipline of war. After a month of targeted destruction of homes, hospitals and schools, they indicate a systematic campaign of terror against an entire population. They recall the worst depravities of the second world war. The conflict in Ukraine is mutating from an all-embracing Russian conquest to the strategic exploiting of separatists in Donbas to strengthen Russia’s position on the Black Sea. It has become an escalation of a secessionist war that began in 2014. From that, Nato and the western world have largely and probably rightly held aloof. But how should the outside world react to the new revelations? The suffering of peoples in conflicts far from Europe tends to pale against suffering “on our doorstep”, when screened nightly on television. Afghanistan’s two decades of western intervention have led millions of Afghans to face starvation, largely through western sanctions. Of their agony the news is silent. That does not make Ukraine’s suffering any less real. This week the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, set up an inquiry to collect evidence of Russian war crimes. These may include breaches of Geneva conventions on the conduct of war, acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. As the international lawyer Philippe Sands has pointed out, “the real issue that prosecutors will face” with regard to these crimes is whether they can “trace responsibility right up to the leadership”. This requires fixing responsibility for frontline behaviour on a superior authority. In Ukraine, it would require evidence that Vladimir Putin ordered or knowingly permitted atrocities. His possible defence – he could not be accountable for the fog of war or the horrors of battle – would have to be rebutted. The first indictment of a sitting head of state before an international tribunal was Yugoslavia’s Slobodan Milosevic in 1999. He was charged with counts emerging from seven massacres. His laborious trial dragged on for six years until in 2006 he died unconvicted in prison. By then Yugoslavia had moved on and the trial had lost retributive or deterrent impact. This illustrates Zelenskiy’s difficulty, but should not discourage him from proceeding. The cruelties of war need constant publicising and the west should offer every assistance. Another judicial route proposed by Sands and others is a tribunal into the crime of aggression in particular. Here the argument is that all actions by soldiers result from decisions by their leaders, including unprovoked aggression against a foreign state. Putin could not wriggle off this hook. His generals, even his seemingly vanished defence secretary, Sergei Shoigu, could argue that they were obeying no orders but his. From the Nuremberg trials to the Charter of the United Nations, international action has struggled to outlaw attacks on one sovereign state by another. It concentrates responsibility at the point of authority, be it democratic or authoritarian. It seeks to bring international law and morality to the service of peace. Law-law is better than war-war. While superficially attractive, such an approach would face uncomfortable hurdles. It would probably require UN security council initiative, which would be vetoed by Russia and possibly China. More to the point, many UN members hardly have clean hands on aggression. Western invasions of Yugoslavia in 1999 and Iraq in 2003 were of dubious legality, as were other interventions around the world by Nato or its members, however noble the intentions. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson and other western leaders gaze at the images from Bucha and give a now standard feelgood twitch. Something must be done and the only thing they can think of is “ever tougher sanctions”. Despite being the most savage ever imposed on an economy of comparable size, they have patently failed to dent Putin’s resolve. Admittedly unreliable polls indicate little domestic opposition to him, whether among the Russian people or the Moscow elite. A sense of embattlement and cultural ostracism has seen both groups hunker down in a patriotic trench. Putin’s decisions are governed by battles not sanctions, by tanks not banks. If the west wants to help Ukraine it should do so by proxy, by sending weapons. History offers scant evidence that decisions taken in the heat of war are governed by economics. The historian Nicholas Mulder finds the US withdrawal of financial support from Britain over Suez in 1956 as one of the few examples of it having any impact on policy. Plenty of sanctions “hurt” – usually the poor – but almost none can be shown to have the slightest bearing on a victim state’s conduct of a conflict. As for driving the price of Europe’s gas, oil and grain through the roof, sanctions may make outsiders “feel Ukraine’s pain”. They will not relieve it, any more than currently traumatising Europe’s political economy for years to come will help a postwar recovery. We should not ignore the most lasting weapon, the tribunal of world opinion. The pictures of Bucha are being seen on the streets not just of Europe and the US but across the world. Russia’s reputation is being badly damaged. There will come a point when the cries of an outraged world penetrate even Moscow’s mendacious publicity machine and set the record straight. As for Putin, he has merely assured himself of pariah status for life. His yacht will never drop anchor in a western harbour.

4/5/2022,"Pamela Rooke, who became an icon of the British punk rock scene under the name Jordan, has died aged 66. Her partner Nick wrote on Brighton and Hove News: “She died peacefully a stone’s throw away from the sea in her home town of Seaford, East Sussex in the company of her loving family at 9pm last night (Sunday 3 April) … after a short period of illness, she succumbed to a relatively rare form of cancer known as cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). Jordan was a wonderful woman and will be remembered for countless decades to come.” With her highly imaginative makeup and clothing, Rooke was a linchpin of the London scene that produced the Sex Pistols, Vivienne Westwood and more; her daring fashion sense helped to coalesce punk’s aesthetic of leather, rubber, slashed fabric, partial nudity and other provocative styling. Rooke got a job at Westwood’s boutique Sex in her late teens. “I was running a gauntlet every day. People were scared of me,” she later said of her daring outfits. “And the funny thing is, I was actually quite shy.” The Sex Pistols were regulars – bassist Glen Matlock worked there at weekends – and Rooke became a mainstay at Sex Pistols gigs, occasionally getting on stage. As well as managing Adam and the Ants, she performed with them, including on the song Lou which appeared on the band’s John Peel session. She also managed Wide Boy Awake, featuring guitarist Kevin Mooney, who she married – they divorced in the mid-1980s. One of her greatest cultural contributions was as a muse of sorts to film-maker Derek Jarman, who cast her as one of the leads in the fantastical Jubilee, playing a punk called Amyl Nitrate. She also appears in his debut film, Sebastiane. Rooke turned away from working in the arts to become a veterinary nurse and cat breeder. “Things had become too hectic. It sounds really corny, but normality saved my life,” she said. She will be portrayed by Game of Thrones actor Maisie Williams in Danny Boyle’s Sex Pistols drama Pistol, airing in May. Rooke recently described how she advised Williams on her performance: “What I said to her was, ‘You’re in a position of playing a role that is very strong, a strong woman, and a woman set apart, really.’ I decided that I wanted to be me, like a walking work of art, if you like, and I was totally and utterly unshakable. So she had to bring that to the role.” Jonathan Ross was among those paying tribute, saying: “An amazing woman. She changed our world. And she loved cats. So sad she’s gone.” Glen Matlock said: “Will miss you girl.”",Arts/Music,"Pamela Rooke, punk rock fashion icon known as Jordan, dies aged 66",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/04/pamela-rooke-punk-rock-fashion-icon-jordan-dies-aged-66
4/5/2022,"Thirty months: that is the very short time the world now has for global greenhouse gas emissions to finally start to fall. If not, we will miss the chance to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The conclusion of the world’s scientists, collated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and approved by all the world’s governments, says this reversal requires “immediate and deep” cuts in emissions everywhere. The language of the third part of the IPCC’s report is less dramatic than the first two, which placed “unequivocal” blame on us for putting a “livable future” in grave peril. Rather than plainly stating the scale of the climate emergency, the new assessment spells out what needs to be done. Its text was therefore haggled over furiously by those states with much to lose. But the conclusion is no less stark: a century of rising emissions must end before 2025 to keep global heating under 1.5C, beyond which severe impacts will increase further, hurting billions of people. “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,” said Prof Jim Skea, a co-chair of the report. “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.” The implication for the biggest culprit, fossil fuels, is clear: it’s over. The IPCC states that existing and currently planned fossil fuel projects are already more than the climate can handle. More projects will lock in even greater emissions and our journey to climate hell. The IPCC warns fossil fuel investors they are on track to lose trillions of dollars if governments act as they must. Responding to the report, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, had a savage assessment of current political and corporate pledges of action: “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing, but doing another. Simply put, they are lying.” “Increasing fossil fuel production will only make matters worse,” he said. “It is time to stop burning our planet, and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us.” That is the good news in the new IPCC report. “We know what we need to do and we can do a lot of it already,” said Stephen Cornelius, at WWF. “But every moment, every policy, every investment, every decision matters to avoid further climate chaos.” The IPCC spells out the huge cost reductions over the last decade in solar and wind power and that some countries already have electricity grids predominantly powered by renewables. It also strongly highlights the big impact possible from energy-efficient homes, walking and cycling, greener diets and less food waste. All these are popular with people, the IPCC notes. “Having the right policies, infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40-70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 – significant untapped potential,” said Prof Priyadarshi Shukla, another IPCC co-chair. “The evidence also shows that these lifestyle changes can improve our health and wellbeing.” Protecting and restoring nature can deliver both large-scale cuts in emissions by ending the razing of forests and large-scale removal of CO2 from the atmosphere through growing trees, the IPCC report says. But it warns this cannot compensate for any delay in cutting fossil fuel burning and must involve Indigenous peoples, who are the best guardians of wild places. With adequate funding, nature could provide up to one-third of cost-effective carbon cuts, as well as protecting and restoring the vital natural ecosystems that sustained life on earth, said Bronson Griscom, at Conservation International. The cost of ending the climate crisis is small, the IPCC concludes. Global GDP is expected to double by 2050 and halving emissions by 2030, to keep on track for 1.5C, would shave 1-2% of that doubling. Taking into account the climate damages avoided and the savings in adapting to extreme weather, investing in emissions cuts saves money. “We must be clear that decisive action on climate is not a ‘cost’; it is an investment, not just in our future, but in our survival. it would be the greatest cost-saving of human history,” said Steve Trent, at the Environmental Justice Foundation. Nonetheless there are upfront costs and Prof Linda Steg, another IPCC co-chair, said: “Many governments are struggling with the question whether people would support changes. This report shows that public acceptability is higher when cost and benefits are distributed in a fair way.” The most controversial part of the IPCC report is about technologies to bury fossil fuel emissions and suck CO2 from the air. The scientists are, at best, cautious about carbon capture and storage, which could extend the use of coal and gas in power stations: “Global rates of CCS deployment are far below those [needed].” But they are clear it is “unavoidable” that some CO2 is going to have to be removed from the atmosphere to balance emissions from energy-intensive industries and aviation, which are hard to decarbonise. That could be growing trees, burning plants and trapping the emissions, or even turning CO2 into rock. But the IPCC warns of dangers, such as biomass plantations pushing food crops aside. Green campaigners are resolutely against such technologies, fearing that polluters could use them as an excuse to continue their activities. “There is no silver bullet for solving climate change but there is a smoking gun, and that’s fossil fuels,” said Nikki Reisch at the Center for International Environmental Law. “The focus must be on [cutting emissions], not purported techno-fixes, which are unproven at scale, pose significant risks to people and nature, and may simply not work to reduce emissions.” The IPCC also emphasises the inequality of global heating and the need for climate justice. The Least Developed Countries (LDC), a grouping of 46 nations, have contributed less than 0.4% of emissions since 1850. The Small Island Developing States, 38 countries that face disappearing under rising seas, contributed 0.5%. In contrast, the IPCC states that, globally, the 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34-45% of global consumption-based emissions. North Americans have a CO2 footprint of nearly 20 tonnes a year, while people in Africa and South Asia are below 5 tonnes. A net zero future can be achieved, the IPPC says, while bringing millions out of poverty, but the finance needed is missing: “Financial flows fall short of the levels needed to achieve [emission-cutting] goals across all sectors and regions.” The issue of money will remain central in the UN climate negotiations, with the next summit in Egypt in November. The IPCC says climate investments need to be three to six times greater than they are today. “The limits [to beating climate change] are not scientific or technological but political and economic,” said Reisch. “This report is a resounding call to action for governments,” said Madeleine Diouf Sarr, chair of the LDC group and the government of Senegal’s climate chief. “Ending the deadly addiction to fossil fuels and harnessing the full potential of cheap and abundant renewable energies is critical. We know the scale of the problem. We know the solution. This report provides a roadmap of how to get there. Let’s get on with it without delay.”",News/Environment,It’s over for fossil fuels: IPCC spells out what’s needed to avert climate disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/its-over-for-fossil-fuels-ipcc-spells-out-whats-needed-to-avert-climate-disaster
4/5/2022,"The largest genetic study of Alzheimer’s to date has provided compelling evidence linking the disease to disruption in the brain’s immune system. The study, using the genomes of 100,000 people with Alzheimer’s and 600,000 healthy people, identified 75 genes linked to an increased risk of the disease, including 42 that had not previously been implicated. The findings suggest degeneration in the brains of dementia patients could be spurred on by “over-aggressive” activity in the brain’s immune cells, called microglia. Prof Julie Williams, the director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at Cardiff University and a co-author of the study, said the findings could help reignite efforts to find an effective treatment. “This is an enormous clue to what’s going wrong,” she said. “Eight or nine years ago we weren’t working on the immune system. The genetics has refocused us.” The study, the largest of its kind to date, also allowed scientists to devise a genetic risk score that could predict which patients with cognitive impairment would, within three years of first showing symptoms, go on to develop Alzheimer’s. The score is not intended for clinical use at the moment, but could be used when recruiting people for clinical trials of drugs aimed at treating the disease in the earliest stages. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, which affects more than 850,000 people in the UK. Despite the huge burden of the disease, there have been no new drugs for it in the past two decades, with the exception of Aducanumab, controversially licensed in the US but unavailable in Europe and the UK. Previous research has shown that while lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise and diet influence Alzheimer’s risk, 60%-80% of the disease risk is based on genetics. However, Williams said, drug development was heavily influenced by the study of families with rare genetic mutations causing early onset Alzheimer’s. The latest work highlights different sets of genes seen in more common forms of Alzheimer’s, including a role for the immune system. “If [at the outset] we’d seen the genetics of common disease, we would’ve said this is an immune disease,” said Williams. “It’s not the same disease.” Risk genes highlighted in the study include ones that affect how efficiently the brain’s immune cells, microglia, clear away tissue that is distressed. In people at risk, these housekeeper cells appeared to be working too aggressively. A similar pattern was found for genes that control how readily synapses, which connect neurons, send out an “eat me” signal when in distress. The high-risk variants appeared to lower the threshold for synapses sending out distress signals, causing the brain to purge connections at a quicker rate. “I’m pretty optimistic that there are treatments that will work for some of the systems we’re looking at,” Williams said. The findings, published in the journal Nature Genetics, fit with previous results pointing to a role for the immune system. People with diabetes, which affects the immune system, are at considerably higher risk, for instance, and once dementia has been diagnosed infections can trigger more rapid cognitive decline. Dr Susan Kohlhaas, the director of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Creating an extensive list of Alzheimer’s disease risk genes is like having the edge pieces of a puzzle put together, and while this work doesn’t give us the full picture, it provides a valuable framework for future developments. The research also, however, tells us just how complex Alzheimer’s is, with several different mechanisms implicated in the development of the disease.” Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said the findings were important for the field. “The new genes provide hints about why people develop Alzheimer’s that will be followed up in future studies to try and better understand the disease and develop treatments,” she said.",News/Society,Alzheimer’s study finds 42 more genes linked to higher risk of disease,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/alzheimers-study-finds-42-more-genes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-disease
4/5/2022,"The world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a “now or never” dash to a low-carbon economy and society, scientists have said in what is in effect a final warning for governments on the climate. Greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025, and can be nearly halved this decade, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to give the world a chance of limiting future heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The final cost of doing so will be minimal, amounting to just a few percent of global GDP by mid-century, though it will require a massive effort by governments, businesses and individuals. But the chances were narrow and the world was failing to make the changes needed, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists warned. Temperatures will soar to more than 3C, with catastrophic consequences, unless policies and actions are urgently strengthened. Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report, said: “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.” The report on Monday was the third and final section of the IPCC’s latest comprehensive review of climate science, drawing on the work of thousands of scientists. IPCC reports take about seven years to compile, making this potentially the last warning before the world is set irrevocably on a path to climate breakdown. Though the report found it was now “almost inevitable” that temperatures would rise above 1.5C – the level above which many of the effects of climate breakdown will become irreversible – the IPCC said it could be possible to bring them back down below the critical level by the end of this century. But doing so could require technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which campaigners warned were unproven and could not be a substitute for deep emissions cuts now. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said some governments and businesses were “lying” in claiming to be on track for 1.5C. In a strongly worded rebuke, he warned: “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing – but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.” Soaring energy prices and the war in Ukraine have prompted governments to rethink their energy policies. Many countries – including the US, the UK and the EU – are considering ramping up fossil fuels as part of their response, but the IPCC report made clear that increasing fossil fuels would put the 1.5C target beyond reach. Guterres said: “Inflation is rising, and the war in Ukraine is causing food and energy prices to skyrocket. But increasing fossil fuel production will only make matters worse.” John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, called the report “a defining moment for our planet” and warned governments must move faster. “The report tells us that we are currently falling short in our battle to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis and mobilise the urgent global action needed. But importantly, the report also tells us we have the tools we need to reach our goals, cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, reach net zero by 2050, and secure a healthier, cleaner planet,” he said. The IPCC working group 3 report found: Coal must be effectively phased out if the world is to stay within 1.5C, and currently planned new fossil fuel infrastructure would cause the world to exceed 1.5C. Methane emissions must be reduced by a third. Growing forests and preserving soils will be necessary, but tree-planting cannot do enough to compensate for continued emissions for fossil fuels. Investment in the shift to a low-carbon world is about six times lower than it needs to be. All sectors of the global economy, from energy and transport to buildings and food, must change dramatically and rapidly, and new technologies including hydrogen fuel and carbon capture and storage will be needed. Pete Smith, a professor of soils and global change at Aberdeen University, said: “The time of reckoning is now. We have one decade to get on track. We use fossil fuels in all these things that we need to change.” Poor countries warned they were ill-equipped to make the changes needed and required financial assistance from richer nations to cut emissions and help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. Madeleine Diouf Sarr, the chair of the least developed countries group at the UN climate talks, said: “There can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure. The emissions from existing and planned infrastructure alone are higher than scenarios consistent with limiting warming to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot. We cannot afford to lock in the use of fossil fuels.” Catherine Mitchell, a professor emerita of energy policy at Exeter University, said the needs of the poorest countries must be prioritised. “Unless we have social justice, there are not going to be more accelerated greenhouse gas reductions. These issues are tied together.” Publication of the report was delayed by a few hours as governments wrangled with scientists in marathon sessions, culminating late on Sunday night, over the final messages in the 63-page summary for policymakers. While IPCC reports are led by scientists, governments have input on the final messages in the summary for policymakers. The Guardian understands that governments including India, Saudi Arabia and China questioned messages including on financing emissions reductions in the developing world and phasing out fossil fuels. However, scientists stressed that the final summary was agreed by all 195 governments. This was the third instalment of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report, covering ways of reducing emissions. It follows a first section published last August that warned human changes to the climate were becoming irreversible; and a second section published at the end of February warning of catastrophic impacts.",News/Environment,IPCC report: ‘now or never’ if world is to stave off climate disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/ipcc-report-now-or-never-if-world-stave-off-climate-disaster
4/5/2022,"A British drama school has closed after an unsuccessful restructure left it with heavy losses and no longer financially viable, resulting in almost 300 students having to change school with no warning. Students at the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts (ALRA) said they were stunned and felt “physically sick” after being told on Monday that the institution, which opened in 1979 and whose alumni include Bridget Christie and Miranda Hart, was closing. All 284 students are being offered places at another drama school, Rose Bruford College, to continue their studies. ALRA said it underwent a restructuring in 2021 but after an unsuccessful search for “new income streams” it was closing with immediate effect. It said its board had sought a new owner but “this was not possible to achieve”. It said: “The ALRA board sought other options and ultimately resolved to cease teaching students, and working with partners [the school is] providing appropriate support to students to find alternative study options.” The institution, which has campuses in central London and Wigan and charged £13,000 a year for some courses, said its 28 permanent and 16 fixed-term employees would lose their jobs. ALRA South students now have the choice of continuing their studies at Rose Bruford, which has sites in London and has run courses in Brighton, Edinburgh and Belfast, or seeking to continue elsewhere, while the Guardian understands ALRA North students may be able to continue studying at the same campus in Wigan. Students shared their shock on social media. Oliver Knowles, an acting student at ALRA North, wrote on Twitter: “Words can’t describe how I feel. An institution that has raised me gradually into the acting industry from the age of 18. I have seen my institution crumble and it saddens me.” Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the Office for Students, said the regulator had been working “intensively with a range of organisations to ensure that ALRA’s students are protected as far as possible in what is inevitably a difficult situation”. In 2020 the school was embroiled in a row when 13 graduates published an open letter accusing it of failing to address systemic racism. One student said a teacher had told her she was a “ghetto girl with a rude girl attitude”, while others reported being exposed to racist stereotypes and language from teaching staff at both ALRA locations. The principal Adrian Hall stepped down after the row and an external review found the school had “turned a blind eye” to racism and had a culture of playing down or dismissing complaints made by students.",News/Education,British drama school closes suddenly after heavy losses,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/04/british-drama-school-closes-suddenly-after-heavy-losses
4/5/2022,"Spanish police and US FBI agents have searched a £70m superyacht in Mallorca linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a sanctioned Russian billionaire the US government says is a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The law enforcement officers on Monday descended on the yacht at the Marina Real in Palma, the capital of Mallorca and the Balearic Islands. The US, EU and UK have impounded several superyachts that have been linked to some of Russia’s richest men to put pressure on oligarchs thought to be close to Putin after his invasion of Ukraine. The latest to be immobilised is Tango, the 78-metre Vekselberg-linked vessel that carries the Cook Islands flag of convenience and is registered to a company in the British Virgin Islands. The yacht can host 14 guests in luxury in seven cabins, with a crew of 22, according to the SuperYachtFan website. Spanish police said in a statement that the yacht was seized as part of investigations into fraud, money laundering and false documents allegedly used to hide ownership of the vessel to avoid sanctions. The raid found documents and devices that have been taken for examination. US authorities identified Tango as Vekselberg’s asset in March, putting its value at $90m (£70m). The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) also said Vekselberg owned a $90m private jet, an Airbus A319 more usually used by airlines to carry up to 150 passengers. Vekselberg’s assets were thought to be worth $6bn, Ofac said, with interests spanning energy and other sectors through his Renova Group conglomerate. He built up his wealth primarily through privatisations of Russian oil and aluminium assets in the chaotic aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union. He was first sanctioned in 2018 by the US in response to Russia’s “malign activity around the globe” including its invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea region, which began in 2014, and support for the regime of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Vekselberg has insisted he has had no involvement in activities related to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. In 2019 he told the Financial Times that he was targeted because: “I am Russian. I am rich. And yes, I know Putin. Today, it is enough.” Before the US sanctions Vekselberg had resettled his family in the US, and he had tried to cultivate close ties with American politicians. He attended Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president in January 2017, and was a board member on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the US’s top universities. Vekselberg has not been sanctioned by the EU, but was added to the UK’s sanctions list on 15 March. The UK government chose to sanction Vekselberg under an “urgent procedure”, a new tool introduced to allow asset freezes on people sanctioned by allies while the government gathers evidence. He had previously tried to build ties in the UK, where he was an honorary member of the prestigious Tate Foundation, a fundraising charity for acquisitions, exhibitions, education and capital projects. The Tate last month severed ties with Vekselberg after pressure from the Labour MP Chris Bryant. The Spanish Civil Guard confirmed that officers from the Spanish police and from the FBI were at the marina searching the vessel Monday morning and said further details would be released later. The FBI was approached for comment. Vekselberg was approached for comment via Renova Group.",News/World news,Spanish police and FBI seize superyacht in Mallorca linked to Putin ally,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/spanish-police-and-fbi-seize-superyacht-in-mallorca-linked-to-putin-ally
4/5/2022,"Transgender people can be legitimately excluded from single-sex services if the reasons are “justifiable and proportionate”, the government’s equalities watchdog has said. Guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission says that the justification could be for reasons of privacy, decency, to prevent trauma or to ensure health and safety. The body also advises that people who hold gender recognition certificates can be excluded from a separate or single-sex space as long as it is a “proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”. It follows an intense debate over whether trans women should be given automatic access to single-sex spaces such as housing shelters, toilets, prisons and changing rooms. Most recently, there has been a debate over the participation of trans women in women’s sports. The guidance, published on Monday, is intended to be a practical guide to help organisations such as hospitals, retailers, hospitality and sports clubs implement policies that are legal and balance the needs of different groups. According to the EHRC: “[The guidance] advises organisations such as hospitals, retailers, hospitality and sports clubs to put in place policies that are both legal and balance the needs of different groups. The guidance confirms that service providers wishing to limit services to a single sex are legally able to do so, provided the reasons are justified and proportionate.” The EHRC says there “are circumstances where a lawfully established separate or single-sex service provider can exclude, modify or limit access to their service for trans people”. The guidance, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, advises service providers offering single-sex services to “consider your approach to trans people’s use of the service”, the nature of the service and the reason a separate or single-sex service is needed. “You must then show that your action is a proportionate way to achieve that aim,” the guidance says. A spokesperson for the LGBT+ rights organisation Stonewall said the guidance appeared to undermine the Equality Act 2010 and to go out of its way to justify the exclusion of trans women. “Far from clarifying how the single-sex exemptions in the Equality Act should be used, the EHRC’s latest non-statutory guidance is likely to create more confusion. It appears to go against the core presumption of the act, which is that inclusion should be the starting point, and shifts the focus towards reasons trans people, and specifically trans women, can be excluded. “The examples appear to encourage blanket bans, rather than by a case-by-case decision-making, and cover restricting access to day-to-day settings like bathrooms and gym classes, which is extraordinary. This leaves more, not less confusion, and more, not less, risk of illegal discrimination,” the spokesperson said. Examples of single-sex services and legitimate justifications given in the guidance include wards in hospitals and nursing homes where “users need special care, supervision or attention”, or separate male and female changing rooms where “a woman might reasonably object to the presence of a man”. Group counselling sessions for female sexual assault victims where it is believed the victims are “likely to be traumatised by the presence of a person who is biologically male” is also offered as a legitimate use of a single-sex space. Trans women could also be excluded from a domestic abuse refuge offering emergency accommodation if residents “feel uncomfortable sharing accommodation … for reasons of trauma and safety”. The provider should compile a list of alternative sources of support, it is suggested. Leisure centres should be able to exclude trans women from female-only fitness classes, the guidance says. The EHRC also gives an example of a community centre with male and female toilets whose users say they “would not use the centre if the toilets were open to members of the opposite biological sex, for reasons of privacy and dignity or because of their religious belief”. The guidance applied whether or not the individual had a gender recognition certificate to show they had legally changed gender, the equalities watchdog said. “[Service providers] do not need personal information such as a gender recognition certificate to make a decision. You only need to decide if your action is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim,” it said. Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the EHRC, said: “Our mission at the EHRC is to protect the rights of everyone and ensure that people across Britain are treated fairly. There is no place for discrimination against anyone based on their sex or gender reassignment. “Where rights between groups compete, our duty as an independent regulator is to help providers of services and others to balance the needs of different users in line with the law. “Organisations are legally allowed to restrict services to a single sex in some circumstances. But they need help to navigate this sensitive area. That is why we have published this guidance – to clarify the law and uphold everyone’s rights.”",News/Society,"Trans people can be excluded from single-sex services if ‘justifiable’, says EHRC",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/trans-people-can-be-excluded-single-sex-services-if-justifiable-says-ehrc
