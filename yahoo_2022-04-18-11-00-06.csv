4/18/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — Beibei sleeps beside thousands of strangers in rows of cots in a high-ceilinged exhibition center. The lights stay on all night, and the 30-year-old real estate saleswoman has yet to find a hot shower. Beibei and her husband were ordered into the massive National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai last Tuesday after spending 10 days isolated at home following a positive test. Their 2-year-old daughter, who was negative, went to her grandfather, while her nanny also went into quarantine. Residents show “no obvious symptoms,” Beibei, who asked to be identified only by her given name, told The Associated Press in an interview by video phone. “There are people coughing,” she said. “But I have no idea if they have laryngitis or omicron.” The convention center, with 50,000 beds, is one of more than 100 quarantine facilities set up in China's most populous city for those such as Beibei who test positive but have few or no symptoms. It's part of official efforts to contain China’s biggest coronavirus outbreak since the 2-year-old pandemic began. But it's also testing patience of people increasingly fed up with China's harsh “zero-COVID” policy that aims to isolate every case. “At the beginning people were frightened and panicked,” Beibei said. “But with the publication of daily figures, people have started to accept that this particular virus is not that horrible.” Beibei was told she was due to be released Monday after two negative tests while at the convention center. Most of Shanghai shut down starting March 28 and its 25 million people were ordered to stay home. That led to complaints about food shortages and soaring economic losses. Anyone who tests positive but shows few or no symptoms is required to spend one week in a quarantine facility. Beibei said she had a stuffy nose and briefly lost part of her senses of taste and smell, but those symptoms passed in a few days. On Sunday, China reported 26,155 new cases, all but 3,529 of which had no symptoms. Shanghai accounted for 95% of the total, or 24,820, including 3,238 with no symptoms. The city has reported more than 300,000 cases since late March. Shanghai began easing restrictions last week, though a health official warned the city didn’t have its outbreak under control. At the convention center, residents are checked twice a day for fever and told to record health information on mobile phones, according to Beibei. Most people pass the time by reading, square dancing, taking online classes or watching videos on mobile phones. The 420,000-square-meter (4.6 million-square-foot) exhibition center is best known as the site of the world’s biggest auto show. Other quarantine sites include temporary prefabricated buildings. Residents of other facilities have complained about leaky roofs, inadequate food supplies and delays in treatment for medical problems. “We haven’t found a place with a hot shower,” Beibei said. “Lights are on all night, and it’s hard to fall asleep.” A video obtained by AP showed wet beds and floors due a leaky roof in a different facility in a prefabricated building. “Bathrooms are not very clean,” Beibei said. “So many people use them, and volunteers or cleaners can’t keep up.”",World/Associated Press,"Shanghai quarantine: 24-hour lights, no hot showers",https://news.yahoo.com/shanghai-quarantine-24-hour-lights-002607294.html

""If [sic] look into the history of [the] Twitter board, it’s intriguing as I was a witness on its early beginnings, mired in plots and coups, and particularly amongst Twitter’s founding members. I wish if [sic] it could be made into a Hollywood thriller one day,"" one user tweeted. ""It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company,"" Dorsey replied. ""Are you allowed to say this?"" another user tweeted. ""No,"" Dorsey replied. Dorsey's comments were replies to a Saturday tweet by venture capitalist Garry Tan, who posted, ""The wrong partner on your board can literally make a billion dollars in value evaporate. ""It is not the sole reason behind every startup failure, but it is the true story a surprising percentage of the time."" Another user replied, ""Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time."" ""Big facts,"" Dorsey replied. Dorsey stepped down as the company's CEO in November. He will remain a member of the board ""until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders,"" according to a Twitter news release from last year. Dorsey's criticism comes after Twitter management on Friday enacted a limited duration shareholder rights plan, also called a ""poison pill,"" should it want to ward off billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's $43 million offer to buy the company, made the week prior, Fortune previously reported. Twitter shares have risen roughly 15% since Musk's 9.2% stake in the company was announced on April 4.

4/18/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s Congress is set to vote on a constitutional reform promoted by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that would undo much of the market opening in electrical power carried out by his predecessor. It is unclear if López Obrador has the votes to push the reform through. But the U.S. and other countries have raised concerns the move will affect foreign investors and violate trade agreements. WHY DID MEXICO INVITE FOREIGN COMPANIES IN? Prior the 2013 energy reform, Mexico faced several problems: high electricity rates, scarce generating capacity and dirty power plants that often burned fuel oil to produce electricity. So the government built pipelines to import cleaner U.S. natural gas, allowed companies to buy electricity from independent generators and gave foreign and private firms incentives to install cleaner wind-power turbines or gas-fired plants. WHY DOES MEXICO'S PRESIDENT WANT TO UNDO REFORM? Mexico may have given private and foreign firms too many incentives. They received preferential treatment in pricing and purchasing, and didn't have to pay the state-owned utility, the Federal Electricity Commission, fees for distributing power through government-owned transmission lines. The state-owned utility lost market share and income, but still had to maintain transmission lines. Worse, with some government plants idle, fuel oil — a dirty byproduct of Mexico's antiquated oil refineries — began building up, until there was no place to store it. WHAT DOES THE CURRENT REFORM AIM TO DO? López Obrador likes state-owned companies and doesn't want the Federal Electricity Commission to go bankrupt or lose more market share. So he has proposed guaranteeing the commission a market share of at least 54% of the electrical power market, with private firms given “as much as 46%."" The commission would be given preference, buying power from its own plants first, while often cleaner energy from private generators would be last in line. For example, the reform puts private natural gas plants almost last in line — ahead of only government coal-fired plants — for rights to sell electricity into the grid, despite the fact they produce power about 24% more cheaply. WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL? Private companies, mainly from Spain and the United States, invested billions of dollars in Mexico to build wind, solar and gas-fired plants under the terms of the 2013 reform. Now, suddenly, the government wants to change those rules. And companies with plants, factories and stores in Mexico need to plan how much their energy costs will be and how green the energy will be, so they often signed long-term power supply contracts with private generators. These contracts could now be declared illegal. Mexican laws require free competition in the power industry. And the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, or USMCA, prohibits member nations from passing laws that favor domestic producers or state-owned firms. WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN? A lot of lawsuits and possibly trade disputes. Critics say the reform will hurt investors and their confidence in Mexico. The companies are likely to file for court injunctions, and the U.S. government may file a USMCA complaint, which could eventually result in compensatory tariffs on Mexican products. López Obrador has already passed a law giving the state utility more discretion in deciding whose electricity to buy, but it remains stalled by court challenges. The president may not get the two-thirds majority in Congress needed to pass the constitutional reforms he seeks. Critics say the reforms may end up forcing Mexicans — and the U.S. retail and auto companies that work in Mexico — to buy more expensive, dirtier electricity. IS IT ONLY ELECTRICITY THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED? No. López Obrador also included a clause declaring lithium — a key component of batteries for electric cars and other devices — a strategic mineral that only the government can mine. A Chinese company has invested in a yet-unopened Mexican mine. Even if the electrical reforms fails, López Obrador has vowed to send another bill on the lithium issue to Congress separately.",World/Associated Press,EXPLAINER: Why is US upset about Mexico's electricity law?,https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-why-us-upset-mexicos-135250501.html
