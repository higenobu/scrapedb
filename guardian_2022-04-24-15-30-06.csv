4/24/2022,"The polls have opened in mainland France for the second round of the presidential election that will see voters choose to give Emmanuel Macron another five years in office or elect Marine Le Pen. Macron is favourite to win but any second term will be determined by whether he finishes with a convincing victory. Both he and Le Pen need to have convinced the almost 50% of voters who did not choose either of them in the first round ballot two weeks ago. The level of abstention and the number of people protest voting by casting a blank ballot, as many supporters of “third man” the radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon have promised, could affect the result. The polling stations close at 7pm this evening in most of mainland France and 8pm in major towns and cities. An estimation of the result based on the count from a number of specific polling stations chosen as representative of France will be announced at 8pm. While it is only an estimation it is usually a reliable indication of who has won unless it is too close to call and within a margin of error. Because of the time difference, those France’s overseas territories began voting on Saturday. Campaigning officially ended at midnight on Friday when all opinion polls ceased and since when the candidates have been obliged to keep a low profile. Macron’s programme includes a cap on fuel prices, indexing pensions and a progressive rise in the retirement age to 65 years. He also campaigned for a stronger Europe. Le Pen has promised to lower the retirement age from 62 to 60 for those who began work before the age of 20, dropping VAT on fuel from 20% to 5.5%, and a new law to allow French nationals priority for housing, jobs and benefits as well as the deportation of illegal immigrants. Macron and Le Pen won places in the second round two weeks ago when he polled just under 9.8m votes – 27.85% of those cast – and she obtained 8.13m votes – 23.15% of those cast. Mélenchon came a close third with 7.7m votes, just 420,000 short of Le Pen. The candidates for the mainstream right and left both trailed with Valerie Pécresse from the conservative Les Républicains in fifth place and Anne Hidalgo for the Parti Socialiste in 10th place; both polled under 5% meaning they will not have their campaign expenses reimbursed.",News/World news,France election: polls open as Macron and Le Pen battle for presidency ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/france-election-polls-open-as-macron-and-le-pen-battle-for-presidency
4/24/2022,"Dan Stevens knew little about Watergate before being cast in Gaslit, a new prestige drama about the 1970s American scandal that toppled a president and shook America. The 39-year-old actor, of early Downton Abbey fame, might now be sitting in his very own Los Angeles garden but, as with many Brits, his knowledge of the affair extended only to the most superficial stuff. “I knew it spawned the gate-suffix,” says Stevens, over Zoom. He’s wearing a jazzy Paul Smith shirt, behind him lush leaves and that Hollywood sunshine. “But you quickly realise there’s a universality to that stupid level of corruption. It’s found in every administration in every country in the world; it just so happens that these guys got caught.” He sees glaring parallels with the British government, or as he put it in a now viral One Show segment: “You’ve got a criminal for a leader who is wrapped in a messy war, embroiled in a stupid scandal, surrounded by ambitious idiots and really should resign… Oh no I’m sorry that’s the intro to Boris Johnson.” Also starring Julia Roberts and Sean Penn, the five-part series – based on the highly successful Slow Burn podcast – sees the often-told story of nefarious political espionage rerun once more, but through the experiences of characters who might otherwise have been considered minor players in a story of high-level Washington rot and paranoia. “It was one of the first times that something played out on television in real time,” says Stevens. “We’re immune to the hypocrisy of our leaders these days, but back then it was such a scandal. And so much of it was buried.” Roberts plays Martha Mitchell, the Arkansan socialite and wife of President Nixon’s loyal attorney general, John Mitchell (Sean Penn). Despite party affiliation, she’s the first person to publicly sound the alarm on Nixon’s involvement in Watergate. Stevens, meanwhile, takes on the part of young hotshot Republican lawyer John Dean, who was steadily climbing the ranks of power when the Watergate break-in occurred. There was talk, before filming started, of Stevens meeting with Dean, one of the few surviving figures depicted. Today, he’s a regular face on CNN and the speaker circuit; either national hero or treacherous rat. “I was keen to sit down with him,” says Stevens – but somehow, word got out about the lunch date. “Then I was told I’d have to speak with Universal’s lawyers in advance, which I didn’t want to do; I didn’t think it would make the meal taste particularly nice.” Instead, he pored over source material: footage from hearings, newspaper clippings. There was plenty to work from as Stevens set about doing what he always does: throwing himself in at the deep end, and learning on the job. In his own words, Stevens was quite the “energetic” child. Adopted just days after birth, he grew up first in Essex, then Wales and Sussex, as his parents – both teachers – moved to follow work. His own school reports, meanwhile, were at least consistent in their content: “Daniel must learn not to distract others” a recurring theme. He’s somewhat guarded when it comes to setting out the full extent of his adolescent indiscretions. He’s blanked out, he says unconvincingly, the details of any major misbehaviour: “Let’s say I was never very good with the institutional side of education.” At nine, he was sent to boarding school. His parents believed a “fully immersive” education might do them all some good. “It’s a weird thing,” he says, of the public school system. “The further you get from it, the more absurd it seems to be to put 60 boys in a house run by teenagers. It takes on its own Lord of the Flies quality – or character building, as the English like to call it.” On a scholarship, he attended Tonbridge School in Kent, where his, let’s say, spiritedness, was quickly channelled into the drama department. “I was shepherded by some great teachers who recognised I could and should act,” Stevens says. “I was nurtured in that direction and kept away from too much trouble, which was an incredible gift.” It became clear early on that he was a talent. There was his turn as Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady, but it was a production of Macbeth, when he was 14, which was a truly formative role. After he auditioned for the part of Fleance – something of a minor character – his teachers suggested he should, in fact, take the lead. Reading English at Cambridge University, Stevens found the Footlights. “I was doing standup, sketch shows and musical comedy,” he says. Granted, he adds, much of it was mediocre. “I never had ambitions to be a comic,” he continues, “but I learned a huge amount about stagecraft from doing it: the ability to get up and make words work for an audience, timing, rolling with what makes people laugh.” In his final year, Stevens was once again cast as the lead in the Scottish play. And, Cambridge being Cambridge, it just so happened that playing Lady Macbeth was Rebecca Hall, now actor and writer. Back then, however, she was a fellow undergrad drama type, whose father was the revered theatre director Sir Peter Hall. “Dan was this striking, oddball guy,” she tells me, the pair are still friends. “He has always been incredibly dextrous – his brain works very fast. My father appreciated nimble actors, and Dad spotted that incredibly quickly.” Impressed, Sir Peter offered Stevens a gig playing Orlando in a touring production of As You Like It before graduation. Student life was swapped for treading the boards. “It was incredible,” Stevens says of the opportunity, “a real apprenticeship in classical theatre, being part of a touring troupe, what I might have been taught at drama school had I gone.” With no formal training, Stevens worked it out as he went along. He soon moved to London and carved out a career in the industry. There were West End roles, and plenty of period telly: The Line of Beauty, Sense and Sensibility and The Turn of the Screw to name a few. When, in 2009, auditions for Downton Abbey were being held, it seemed to be a job like any other. “I’d done my fair share of period drama by that point,” he says. “I considered not going up for it, or not doing it when I got it. I felt I’d already done them.” In the end, Stevens decided to do just one more. “Nobody knew what it was going to become,” he says. It was commissioned as an eight-part mini-series. “There was no sense when we were making it that it would be the juggernaut it turned into.” Julian Fellowes, Downton’s creator and writer, remembers clearly what he saw in Stevens: “Dan had this tremendous power on screen and is one of the handsomest men I’ve ever met,” he tells me. “He had a charming moral decency we felt would work.” In late 2012, three seasons in, Downton was still clocking up 10m+ British viewers during its Sunday-night airings; in the US, that figure was hitting a staggering 24m week on week. But while the show was going from strength to strength, Stevens was eyeing up an exit, discontent at the prospect of a lifetime playing floppy-haired, morally decent, period-drama chaps. “There were definitely creative itches left unscratched,” Stevens explains of his decision to leave the show, “genres I hadn’t worked in. Three years were up, that’s what we’d initially signed up for, and the appetite to explore further was too great.” It was only close to the start of filming for that third season that Stevens confirmed his departure. Fellowes tells me a major death had already been booked in for episode five, leaving them little room for another. So on Christmas Day 2012, his character, Matthew Crawley, was killed off in a fatal car accident in what was, quite frankly, an ending altogether void of festive cheer. “It’s not something I expect people to readily understand,” Stevens says of the departure. “Some admire it, others think I was mad: that the part was the greatest thing that could ever happen to me.” It takes some self-confidence, surely, to walk away from such a secure spot in a behemoth of broadcasting, at a time when increasingly lucrative contracts were, no doubt, being negotiated once more. “But the question is what would satisfy you? A bit more money and the same thing for another decade,” Stevens replies, “or the great unknown. The wild west. An open playing field of potential.” Being in such a high-profile production also came with attention. “There was certainly a feeling that such a level of focus from the British tabloid press was not the greatest thing to have in one’s life,” says Stevens. “We got out of the UK at a time when it wasn’t hugely problematic. And maybe it wouldn’t have been. But there was this fear of raising a family into that environment.” And so, Stevens headed stateside. By that January, he was rehearsing for his broadway debut opposite Jessica Chastain. Then came a movie in Brooklyn. Stevens upped sticks and settled in New York with his wife – Susie Hariet, a South African Jazz singer and teacher – and their two oldest children. Six years later, by now with another child, they headed west to LA, where the family has remained. “There’s an imagination in casting here that’s refreshing,” Stevens says. “If you haven’t been seen doing something, they might be open to seeing you try. There are strict channels in the UK: ah you play posh period dramas? In your box you go. Gritty northerners? That’s what you’ll do… I could see a world in which sticking around wouldn’t have been satisfying.” If a diverse plethora of parts was his ambition, it’s fair to say he has achieved it. From sci-fi (Colossal, Kill Switch) and family blockbusters (Beauty and the Beast, Night at the Museum) to Apostle’s sheer horror, Stevens has grafted to carve out quite an eclectic career. He’s also been dipping his toe back in comedy, earning himself no shortage of admirers, Will Ferrell included. The pair worked together in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, which Ferrell also produced. “He showed up on the first day with this fully fleshed-out character, complete with Russian accent,” Ferrell tells me. “He was working far harder than I was, whether improvising with me or performing his song and dance numbers. Plus, through the night he was auditioning for other projects; he has this extraordinary dedication to his craft.” “You have to be prepared,” Stevens says, “for people to be confused by your desire to do both animated family comedy and twisted horror in the same calendar year.” It’s that creative stimulation that he thrives on. “That’s not to say you and I won’t sit down in 10 years when I’ll have been playing the same sitcom character for a decade, and I’ll mutter something about mortgages and school fees…” But honestly? Stevens can’t see that happening. “Possibly there’s a certain creative ADHD in me,” he says. “I’ve tried all sorts, not all of it successful. It’s terrifying and thrilling, but if the territory is too familiar, I’ll just get bored.” Gaslit premieres on Sunday 24 April on StarzPlay",Arts/Culture,Dan Stevens: ‘People thought I was crazy’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/24/dan-stevens-people-thought-i-was-crazy-his-journey-from-downton-to-hollywood
4/24/2022,"My name is Barbara and I’ve been a vinyl-abuser. In youth, I did unspeakable, shameful things to records. I’d leave them out of their covers. I’d abandon them on the floor and walk on them; sometimes dance on them. I’d balance wine glasses, ashtrays and nail varnish pots on them. If a track started jumping, I’d stick a penny (or three) on the stylus. When records were trashed, I’d buy them again. Which is how I emerged from years of music journalism with several wrecked copies of the Jesus and Mary Chain’s Darklands and a scratched, filthy record collection worth about 20 pence. While fellow music hacks sit pretty on vinyl goldmines, what remains of my collection will one day have to be disposed of by toxic waste experts wearing biohazard suits. What an idiot. Then again, as the lady sang, je ne regrette rien. My vinyl may be worthless, but the feelings and memories are priceless. I was reminded of my vinyl-atrocities by the run-up to yesterday’s 15th annual Record Store Day, a global event to support and celebrate independent record stores, where artists release special editions you can only buy from record shops. This year, Taylor Swift is the special ambassador and there are hundreds of special releases featuring artists from U2 to Cypress Hill, Blur to Stevie Nicks. While some have issues with Record Store Day, such as major labels hijacking it, it’s generally perceived as a great thing: keeping a crucial branch of the music ecosystem alive. Amen to that. However, there’s an elitist side to vinyl culture, a nerd shadow-world encapsulated in various online tips for Record Store Day: Be prepared… Arrive early… Meet other vinyl enthusiasts… Plan ahead for weather. Oh Christ, you think, Record Store Day may be many wonderful things, but it’s also a mass global gathering of Vinyl Bores. It’s a recurring issue: should a musical format matter that much – more than the actual music? How do Vinyl Heads become Vinyl Bores? First things first: you’ve got to applaud the tenacity: the hand-wringing down the years about every format change, from CDs to streaming, including some you’ll have forgotten. Mini-discs, anyone? Please note that Vinyl Bores are a species distinct from Vinyl Heads, most of whom are just as likely to fashion a Spotify list as they are to rhapsodise about rare albums. There are even people able to talk about historical studio techniques/listening modes and the myriad sounds/atmospheres/nuances they produce, without making you want to claw your own ears off and feed them to a dog. Vinyl Bores/Snobs are a self-regarding breed apart: they tolerate no other formats and regard other listening modes as cultural philistinism. You may have met one or two of them. They treat their records like priceless exhibits at Sotheby’s. They store them in plastic sleeves and clean them with little dusters. They balance them between their palms. They lower them on to turntables as if performing a sacred ritual. There may be an anxious inspection of the stylus – has a minuscule speck of dust managed to attach itself? When music is (finally) permitted, it’s hard to hear it over the inevitable highly technical tutorial about superior sound quality that feels as long as Bob Dylan’s career. What life-sapping madness is this? When I was a music journalist, I had about as much interest in the mechanics of formats as I did in how a kettle worked. It was the music that mattered and it could have arrived in a cereal packet for all I cared. Fetishising vinyl struck me as fuddy-duddy and weirdly sex-specific: something mainly blokes did. I thought music should be visceral, not collectible, hence the vinyl-abuse (my excuse anyway). Still today, I wonder: why is it that some people allow a format – how music is conveyed – to overwhelm the love of music itself? Since music was rendered anti-physical, I understand the vinyl argument more. Not only does Spotify have ignoble form for treating artists shabbily, it sometimes feels like a huge, soulless, aural discount supermarket. I mourn the loss of cover art and the dying concept of “the album” in an era where tracks are scattered to the winds. And sometimes it’s good to be reminded that listening to music can be an activity, not just “background noise”. I can see how vinyl could feel like a grassroots rebellion against commercialism: socking it to The Man, creating a cottage industry of sound Spotify can’t get its mitts on. That said, isn’t vinyl itself an established, highly lucrative wing of the industry? A couple of years ago, it outsold CDs. Negatively speaking, the heightened emphasis on heritage acts can represent cultural stagnation. Then there’s consumer expense: decent kit alone – turntables and speakers – is far from cheap. Nor is vinyl portable or always accessible; storing records must be difficult for skint renters. Worse, there’s the abiding sense of snobbery, elitism, a posture of authenticity that too often feels like crowing. Do Vinyl Snobs think they’re superior to other music fans? I think a fair few of them do. There’s that sense of: “We might both enjoy music, we may even like the same artists, but do you listen to them ‘correctly’?.” What emerges is a fetish for format that drags everything back to the dreary, dated concept of “good” and “bad” taste, when one of the most powerful aspects of music is that it’s democratic: everyone’s vote is equal. In a way, where’s the fire? For some people, on Record Store Day – and every other day – the human soul is round, made of black plastic and has a little hole in the middle. Which is great. It just doesn’t make you better than me.

4/24/2022,"The interruption was unplanned but Joe Biden immediately knew this was no ordinary heckler. “I agree!” he told a babbling baby as the audience laughed. “I agree completely. By the way, kids are allowed to do anything they want when I speak so don’t worry about it.” It was a welcome note of light relief during a speech that could not be described as blockbuster television. Beside a blue sign that said “Building a Better America”, perched on a white boat at the New Hampshire Port Authority in Portsmouth, the US president was last week trying to gin up enthusiasm about infrastructure investment and supply chains. Biden’s choice of state was telling: Democratic senator Maggie Hassan faces New Hampshire voters in November as she seeks a second term in elections that will decide the control of Congress. And not for the first time, there are fears the Democrats have a messaging problem. The party does have a story to tell about the creation of 7.9 million jobs – more over his first 14 months in office than any president in history – along with progress against the coronavirus pandemic, the passage of a $1tn bipartisan infrastructure law, diverse judicial appointments and leading the Nato alliance against Russia’s Vladimir Putin. But opinion polls suggest this could be overwhelmed by Republicans’ characteristically blunt and visceral campaign targeting 40-year high inflation, rising crime, immigration at the Mexico border and “culture wars” over abortion, transgender rights and how race is taught in schools. “Hearts beats charts,” said John Zogby, an author and pollster. “Very simply, look at the Democrats who’ve won the presidency: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden. Contrast the obvious empathy and real-life stories with Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton. “It’s the ability to tell a story that relates to all Americans. All of which is to suggest that Republicans will tell stories that matter and Democrats will show statistics.” The stakes this time could hardly be higher: the Senate is currently split 50-50, while Democrats can afford to lose only three seats in the House of Representatives if they want to retain control. Given the headwinds typically faced by the president’s party in midterms, Republicans believe both chambers are within their grasp. Such an outcome could turn Biden into a lame-duck president, able to do little more than issue executive orders and veto legislation, while empowering congressional Republicans to launch investigations into his son, Hunter Biden, and other foes while paving the way for the return of the former president, Donald Trump. The polls look bleak for Democrats. Last month, NBC News found that 46% of registered voters prefer a Republican-controlled Congress while 44% want Democrats in charge – the first time Republicans have led in this survey since September 2014. Inflation fears dominate, according to online focus groups run last week by Navigator Research with swing voters in Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin. They found that presenting economic facts “only modestly moves the needle” and pervasive inflation concerns outweigh job creation. A North Carolina woman who took part said of the economy: “So you can tell me it’s doing great but if I’m struggling to buy groceries and gas and will be out of a job in two months, that to me is saying no, it’s not really doing that great.” Biden has attempted to shift blame for rising fuel costs to “Putin’s price hike” but with limited success. His public approval rating stands at 43%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, with disapproval of his job performance at 51%. Democrats’ four most-endangered Senate incumbents – Hassan of New Hampshire, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada – duly seem to be distancing themselves from the president, for example by visiting the southern border and criticising his plan to lift a pandemic-era restriction there known as Title 42. Biden, touring the country and refocusing on domestic concerns after two months dominated by Ukraine, wants to convince voters that investing in roads and bridges is a major accomplishment after years of unfulfilled promises from his predecessor. But most of the benefits will not be felt for years and even the word “infrastructure” tends to land with a thud. There are further worries that the Democratic base, including many voters of colour, will stay at home on election day, disenchanted by the party’s failure to get gun safety, police reform and voting rights legislation through Congress. Biden no longer uses the phrase “Build Back Better” and is struggling to salvage parts of that plan to address the climate crisis. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: “The difficulty that Democrats have is that a message that would energise the base is not one that resonates with the centre. The swing voter doesn’t prioritise voting rights, climate change, big expansion of spending. They want much more pedestrian things and Democrats have not yet figured out how to have a narrative that combines both.” Republicans have the luxury of opposition, Olsen added. “When you don’t have the power to be for anything, it’s easier to be against something and that’s what you’re going to see: Biden inflation, Biden weakness, Biden liberalism, Biden socialism. “They will try to paint the Democratic party as a whole with its left wing but, by and large, they will attack Biden and the Democratic party as out of touch and producing bad results for the average American on the things they care most about: crime, immigration and the economy. This is one of, if not the most, favourable environment for an out party that I’ve seen in my lifetime.” Indeed, Republicans are exuding confidence despite still being in thrall to a former president who incited a deadly insurrection and despite offering no policy agenda. Florida senator Rick Scott, the chairman of the national Republican senatorial committee, published his own 11-point plan that includes forcing poorer Americans who do not currently pay income tax to do so, but it was swiftly disowned by minority leader Mitch McConnell. Instead, Republicansare filling the vacuum by assailing rising prices at the petrol pump and at the supermarket (“Bidenflation”), increasing crime rates in major cities and Biden’s reversal of Trump-era policies on immigration. US authorities arrested 210,000 migrants attempting to cross the southern border in March, the highest monthly total in two decades. The party has also reverted to its playbook of social and cultural hot-button topics, railing against a caricature of “critical race theory” (CRT) in schools and pushing state legislation to restrict abortions and ban transgender children from sport. It casts itself as a champion of “parental rights” while portraying Democrats as “woke” socialists bent on controlling lives’ and “cancelling” dissent. Addressing the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank in Washington last month, Scott warned: “We survived the war of 1812, world war one, world war two, Korea, Vietnam and the cold war. But now, today, we face the greatest danger we have ever faced: the militant left wing in our country has become the enemy within.” Come election season, Democrats are often accused of bringing a power-point presentation to a bar brawl: trying to explain policies in intellectual paragraphs while Republicans spin slogans ready-made for car bumper stickers. But this time some Democrats say they are ready to take the fight to their opponents. Congressman Eric Swalwell of California has just launched the Remedy political action committee, which turns Scott’s message on its head by contending that American democracy is “under attack from within” and promising to “hold accountable those who choose party over country”. Swalwell said: “At the end of the day, elections are about A or B. It’s about drawing a contrast and we can just make it as simple as chaos or competency. When it comes to transitions of power, do you want violence or voting? When it comes to the character of who runs the country, do you want indecency or integrity?” “When [pro-Trump members of Congress] Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene proudly declare that they’re not the fringe, they’re the base of the party, we’re going to make sure every voter knows that. That’s what they’re going to get if they give Republicans the keys to the country.” One dilemma for Democrats is how much time they should spend harking back to Trump, reminding voters of the existential threat that his party still poses to democracy, versus a positive forward-looking vision that encompasses bread-and-butter concerns. Swalwell acknowledges that Democrats must identify with the pain that people are feeling from inflation while also offering solutions. He points to last month’s example of the House passing a bill to limit the cost of insulin to $35 a month (Americans currently pay around five to eight times more than Canadians). Some 193 Republicans opposed the bill while just 12 voted in favour. Swalwell said: “We’re going to make them own walking away from solutions that would help people. Their plan for the economy is that 100 million people will pay more in taxes: that’s Rick Scott’s rescue plan that they’re running on. As people pay more already at the checkout stand, Rick Scott would have most Americans pay more in taxes. “It’s going to be about choices and, if we have the resources to tell America what the choices are, we’re going to win. Right now I see the punditry betting against us but I don’t see our supporters betting against us because, when you look at Democratic versus Republican fundraising quarter after quarter, we’re beating them. There’s no fatigue in our base. They get it.” The four embattled Senate Democrats – Cortez Masto, Hassan, Kelly and Warnock – outraised their Republican opponents in the first quarter of this year, boosting hopes that supporters will remain energised. Trump’s determination to insert himself into dozens of races with risky endorsements, campaign rallies and his “big lie” of a stolen election could also galvanise Democrats and independents. Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican national committee, predicts that Republicans will pick up 30 to 35 seats in the House but Democrats might just hold the Senate. He said: “The Republicans’ main message is going to be Democrats can’t run the country. ‘I give you the economy. I give you culture. I give you crime.’ And the Democrats’ message is, ‘Can we get back to you in a moment?’ That sums up the 2022 election.” He added: “Republicans don’t have to run on anything substantive; all they have to do is say, ‘gee, look how screwed up these guys are.’ You’re going to see Republicans run a culture war-based strategy that drives the fear and loathing that white suburban families, particularly women, have over things that are not even relevant to their children’s lives, like CRT. And Democrats will be sitting there pissed off at all the wrong stuff.”",News/US news,Joe Biden’s message drowned out by beat of the Republican culture-war drum,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/24/joe-bidens-message-drowned-out-by-beat-of-the-republican-culture-war-drum
4/24/2022,"An hour or so before Boris Johnson was due to fly back to the UK from Delhi on Friday evening – after a two-day trade mission to India – some electrifying news broke on Twitter. Anushka Asthana, ITV’s deputy political editor, had tweeted that “fines are landing into people’s inboxes relating to the garden event on May 20th 2020 – the BYOB [bring your own bottle] event – that Boris Johnson did go to”. The trip to India had already been overshadowed by Partygate. The Tories had endured a terrible week in parliament and Johnson was facing a third inquiry into parties at No 10. Now British journalists who had accompanied the prime minister to India seized on the latest bombshell – and wanted responses. Johnson was at a business reception – his last event of the trip – and his aides had been caught unaware by the news. The journalists asked if the prime minister had also been fined and were hoping to put the question directly to Johnson himself on the lengthy flight back to London. But during the journey they were told he would not be coming down the plane to chat, as is customary on such trips, because he was asleep. Johnson had already been fined once, over the Easter recess, for attending his own birthday celebration in June 2020 in breach of lockdown rules, and had issued a grovelling apology to parliament on Tuesday before flying off to Delhi. But the story that refuses to go away was taking off again. Could he survive a second fine? Would he make a second apology? How many more fines and apologies could there be? Back in London, No 10 said he had not been fined again so far as anyone was aware – but it fell short of a categorical denial that one might come, or could already be in the post. After this latest shambolic few days of the Johnson premiership, two things are now far clearer than they were last weekend. First, much as Johnson wants to draw a line under Partygate, everyone at Westminster now knows he will definitely not be able to do so any time soon. And second, more and more Tory MPs are losing faith in their leader, feeling they can no longer defend his behaviour to their constituents. As one party grandee commented on Wednesday, with local elections two weeks away: “Colleagues are just bored with it all. They are depressed that every morning they wake to confront their inboxes filled with all this hate about parties. They feel they can’t defend it to people any more and they don’t want to be associated with it.” A former cabinet minister added on Friday that Johnson could stagger on until the autumn but it was clear he was on his way out. He had turned from an electoral asset to electoral liability. “There could be three or four more fines and three or four more apologies, then the Metropolitan police report, then the Sue Gray report, which will in all probability be very critical, and now we have a parliamentary report going on for months,” the minister said. “Then, Boris being Boris, he will screw other things up. There is no doubt where all this will end.” On Tuesday, Johnson appeared still to believe that contrition over the birthday-party fine could get him through. Late that afternoon, he stood up in the Commons, wearing the most apologetic and humble face he could muster, and said sorry over and over again. “I make it absolutely clear that in no way do I minimise the importance of this fine,” was his answer to an intervention from the veteran MP Sir Bill Cash. “I am heartily sorry for my mistake, and I accept completely the decision of the police.” But the period of prime ministerial contrition was very brief. A couple of hours later, after former Tory chief whip Mark Harper announced he could no longer support him, Johnson addressed a meeting of Conservative backbenchers on the 1922 Committee and appeared to have fully recovered. Those present were struck by how suddenly the prime minister’s mood had improved. But they were not all cheered by his rediscovered good humour. “He just tried to crack a series of jokes,” said one former minister who was there. “It was like he was giving an after-dinner speech. There was no sign of the humility of hours earlier I don’t think he had thought about what he wanted to say and it didn’t go down well. By the end, he had lost the room. He said he was determined to get on with the job but it was as if his rule-breaking didn’t matter any more.” The next day, at prime minister’s questions, there was an eerie absence of the normal supportive noise behind Johnson. Something had changed. “It was so noticeable,” said a Labour MP afterwards. “You could see his authority draining away.” Labour was demanding that Johnson be referred to a Commons committee to determine whether he had knowingly misled the Commons over lockdown-breaking parties that he had previously denied had ever happened. As word of the Labour motion spread, Tory MPs became increasingly concerned at suggestions that No 10 would order them to block it. “There were loads of Tories in a complete state,” said a Labour frontbencher, “because they feared what their constituents would say if they voted to oppose another inquiry into rule-breaking. They kept saying ‘Owen Paterson, Owen Paterson’ and that No 10 had not learned its lesson.” Aware of the unhappiness, the Tory whips and No 10 drew up a compromise plan that involved amending the Labour motion in order to push its start date back until after the after the Met report into parties has been published. But even that was too much for many Tories, who had lost patience with being told how to react to, and vote on, Partygate. They knew what they thought. Tory MPs milled round the Commons saying they would not play ball. It was a quiet revolt, but one that spoke volumes about the prime minister’s sudden loss of control over his troops in parliament. One former minister said his constituency chairman had contacted him to say the issue should be examined by the Commons privileges committee, as Labour was demanding, so that all the details of advice to Johnson about parties and photographs could be flushed out and the full truth could become known. Several junior ministers threatened to resign. Another ex-minister said: “I told the whips ‘no way’ – I would not be there for the vote on Thursday whatever happened.’” Frantic phone calls were held between London and Ahmedabad, where a tired and overheated Johnson had not been able to escape domestic events and feared a mass rebellion in his own parliamentary ranks. Then on Thursday morning, ministers put up the white flag and pulled the amendment, granting Tory MPs a free vote on the Labour motion. Later that day – without a single Tory opposing it– MPs approved the Labour motion to set up the extra inquiry. Extraordinarily, it concluded by describing Johnson’s previous statements to parliament, in which he had denied being aware of parties taking place, as comments that “appear to amount to misleading the House”. And no Tory objected, while Steve Baker, one of the few to actually make it into the chamber, told the House: “The prime minister now should be long gone. The prime minister should just know the gig’s up.” Two days earlier he had publicly backed Johnson. Labour was cock-a-hoop. Officials said they had succeeded in preventing the government, ahead of the local elections, from changing the agenda and luring them into traps over issues such as Priti Patel’s policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. Keir Starmer had taken the high ground in his speech, focusing on trust in politicians and the future of democracy, to guard against accusations that he was politicising Partygate. After the vote, however, he went down to the Strangers’ bar and bought everyone a drink, safe in the knowledge that Johnson would not escape the issue for many months to come if he remained in office. That night on the BBC 10pm news, the lead item came from India and showed Johnson facing questions about the vote and the new Partygate inquiries. The second item featured the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in Washington, talking about the fine he had also received for breaching lockdown rules. So much for “getting on with the job”. MPs are now assessing the effects all this is having on voters before the local elections on 5 May. Many Conservative MPs are waiting for the results before deciding whether to write letters expressing no confidence in Johnson to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee. Another Tory grandee who had been on the campaign trail on Saturday said his impression was that the Conservative vote was holding fairly firm in many areas. But he noted that there was a “sizable minority” of Tory voters who were now saying: “Not while Boris is prime minister.” This number, he suggested, could be large enough to send Conservative councillors to defeat in some key areas and possibly, as a result, have the knock-on effect of bringing down the curtain on the Johnson premiership.",News/Politics,"Fines, fury and backbench panic: how political chaos followed Johnson to India",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/24/fines-fury-and-backbench-panic-how-political-chaos-followed-johnson-to-india
4/24/2022,"What ails the royal family? By Tina Brown’s telling, the answer to this perennial and highly thorny question is: just about everything. Yes, it’s partly a simple matter of context; in the early 21st century, there no longer seems to be much point to the hats and the parades and the tours (Kate and William in the Caribbean? Cringe de la cringe! as Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas would say.) And yes, it’s a suffocating way to live: like being a “battery hen in the Waldorf Astoria”, as Brown puts it, struggling somewhat for the right image. But the former editor of the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, having applied all of her famous wit and intelligence to the problem, identifies many other maladies, too. Sadism, parsimony, profligacy, infantilism, randiness, ruthlessness, rudeness, coldness, extreme entitlement and, last, but not least, incredible stupidity; alas, among the Windsors, all are present and correct. The family is a walking, talking advert either for – take your pick – intensive group therapy or religious seclusion (after all, wasn’t Prince Philip’s ma a nun or something?). No wonder the Queen Mother’s steward, William Tallon, used to herald dinner at her Scottish retreat, Birkhall, by swinging a censer, as if he was a priest. I must admit that I did not have high hopes of The Palace Papers, whatever its author has to say in her prologue about the zillions of insiders (OK, 120) she spent two years stalking; the first person she quotes by name is – zzzzz! – Gyles Brandreth, which didn’t seem to me to bode well in terms of hot new info (when isn’t the former Tory MP up for talking about Prince Philip?). But having ploughed through almost 600 pages of “truth and turmoil” – I do these things so you don’t have to – all I can say is that if one must read royal gossip, let it be written by Tina, a woman who, as a former editor of Tatler, not only knows how to write an extended picture caption – “Harry’s hot and heavy glamping retreat!” – but who also remains, in spite of the long years she has lived in Manhattan, crazily attentive to the minute gradations of social class that make this country such a basket case. Was the Queen Mother preposterously posh or seriously suburban? For days now, I haven’t been able to stop thinking of the two cherubim on her four-poster bed at Clarence House, whose little angel outfits – I’m not kidding – were washed and starched by her servants every month. The book, which is as fat as Paradise Lost and definitely won’t fit in your Launer handbag, begins with a waspish account of the memorial in 2006 for the Queen’s cousin, the photographer Lord Lichfield, an event at which Brown was happily in attendance (she sat beside the aforementioned Tallon, in whose Kennington flat she would later see “a draping of pearls he said belonged to the Queen Mother” and many other “discarded bibelots… whether bestowed or pilfered was anybody’s guess”). Brown carefully notes the appearance of the royal family on this occasion: the Duchess of Cornwall’s hat made her look like an air steward; a person could, she thought, have rooted “for truffles in the forests of bad teeth”. But naturally she’s delighted by their shabbiness, just as she’s thrilled to hear that, afterwards, Andrew Parker Bowles (“a walking pink gin”) was seen strap-hanging in his morning suit on the tube. Her interest is in dust, not diamonds. She has a taste, you soon gather, for minor characters. The sad, Norma Desmond-ish spaces these types inhabit – Prince Andrew at home with his 50 teddy bears, many of them dressed as sailors; Princess Margaret complaining that she only wants to see pictures of her sister on postage stamps, not “ghastly buildings and birds and things” – are so much fun to describe, after all. Far better than the garden at Highgrove, at any rate. Thanks to all this, the bits about the Queen and Philip, and Kate and William, are a bit boring. The pace picks up when she’s analysing the Duchess of Sussex, whom henceforth will always be known to me as Number Six on the Call Sheet (Brown’s account of Meghan’s acting career – she has watched her Suits audition tapes – is going to be a huge hit with Piers Morgan). As Brown sagely states, calling your agent won’t help in the case of primogeniture. But I think she’s at her absolute best when she’s dealing with the likes of Andrew and Fergie and with Camilla in the days before she finally married Charles. In these chapters, simply everything is either comical or ghastly, or both. In case you were wondering, it’s Andy who’s the sadist. “What are you doing with this fat cow?” he asked an American media executive who’d come to have lunch with his ex-wife at their home, Royal Lodge, in 2015. The Queen’s second son is so stupid and so pompous, he once seriously pitched to the then London mayor, Boris Johnson, the idea of reducing the number of traffic lights in the capital. The deep thinking behind this masterplan was that this would result in fewer red lights. He also thought the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre should be bigger; God alone knows why. It’s Camilla, though, who really fascinates Brown: her stoicism, her earthiness, the fact that she once French-kissed Charles in front of her husband (this was in 1980, at a polo ball hosted by the heir to a meat fortune Lord Vestey and it went on for hours, apparently). What drew her to Charles, a man whom Brown depicts as a ruthless, spoilt baby – and who would, she can’t resist reminding us, come to be known as Prince Tampacchino in the Italian press? (Work it out.) What kept her at his side for so long? I’d have quit once I’d finished dying of laughter at the revelation that the coronet he wore for his investiture as Prince of Wales was topped with a gold-covered ping pong ball. I suppose it was sex in the beginning – “Pretend I’m a rocking horse,” the young Camilla is said to have urged the sexually “diffident” Charles – and then, later, it was comfort. She subsumed the role played in his life by the Queen Mother, “the buttery scone to his mother’s steamed broccoli”. Anyway, this bit of the book fairly rips along, the bastard child of Jilly Cooper and Tom Wolfe. Like Queen Mary, who once said to a relative: “We [the royal family] are never tired”, Brown is quite inexhaustible. But as for what all this hard labour has been for, exactly, I don’t know. Hasn’t she anything better to do with her time than to tell us about – no, this is not a euphemism – Andrew’s 6ft-long ironing board? About Charles’s preference for Kleenex Velvet loo roll? Honestly. I’m embarrassed for her. Cringe de la cringe.  The Palace Papers by Tina Brown is published by Century (£20). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

4/24/2022,"In 1993, the photographer Robin Graubard fell into conversation with a group of women in a park outside the UN building in New York. The women were talking about how no American paper was properly covering the war in Sarajevo. Graubard, who was best known for her pictures of youth culture in the States, organised some press credentials from Newsweek and got a flight to Prague, which she guessed would be a safe place from which to travel alone to the former Yugoslavia. She ended up staying there for three years, working not only in the Czech Republic and Sarajevo but also in Albania, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Hungary as they emerged from decades of Soviet rule. Graubard’s mostly unpublished pictures from that time are collected in a new book, Road to Nowhere. Her focus is often on children and teenagers, some clinging to life in orphanages or disfigured by the fallout of war, others trying on western styles or losing themselves at rock concerts. The backdrop to their lives is frequently bare rooms or burnt-out buildings. The bright eyes of many of these young people look out on startling bleakness, as if they have wandered into school productions of apocalypse. This picture, taken at a tram stop beside a Soviet-era petrochemical plant near Prague, is one of the least disturbing of Graubard’s images. Even so, the three generations waiting for a ride look as if they might have been cast, unwittingly, in some bleak theatre of the absurd. In recent weeks the horrific images from Ukraine of women and children in transit have been juxtaposed with pictures of the refugee crisis after the second world war. Graubard’s photographs are a telling reminder that the east of the continent has known the deprivations of conflict and occupation much more recently than that. As she says in a diary entry in this book: “Things seem to go full circle.”  Road to Nowhere by Robin Graubard is published by Loose Joints (£35)",Arts/Art and design,The big picture: waiting on a road to nowhere in 1990s Czech Republic,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/24/the-big-picture-waiting-for-a-tram-to-nowhere-in-1990s-czech-republic-robin-graubard
4/24/2022,"Designers Keith Stephenson and Mark Hampshire have a longstanding love of the English coast. It has always been an important point of inspiration for the wallpaper and textile patterns within their collections for Mini Moderns, which the partners founded 16 years ago. Their enduring relationship with the shoreline was revitalised when Stephenson and Hampshire eventually decided to buy and update a railway carriage cabin, perched on the shingle peninsula of Dungeness. “I used to work as an art director in fashion and we would do shoots down here on the beach during the 90s,” says Stephenson. “That was my first introduction to Dungeness. After Mark and I met we used to come down from London quite regularly on a Sunday just to see the sea and kick off the working week. It was just a way of getting away from everything – and it still is.” Stephenson and Hampshire started collaborating with the artist Rob Ryan on a wallpaper collection 10 years ago, and he would sometimes lend the couple a flat in Rye that he was renting at the time. On one of these Kent coastal visits, they suddenly ended up buying a house. “We had exhausted all the secondhand shops in Rye, so we started looking in the estate agents’ windows,” says Stephenson. “We ended up on a little trip to Dungeness doing more than just staring at the sea. We looked at the cabin on the Sunday, and by Monday we had put in an offer.. Houses on Dungeness don’t come up for sale very often and this one had not been on the market for very long.” The cabin itself dates back to the 1920s when South Eastern Railway which once owned the Dungeness Estate, offered its staff the chance to buy redundant railway carriages, which were taken off the nearby sidings and pushed on to the shingle using telegraph poles as rollers. These fresh lines of carriage cabins helped transform the hamlet, adding a cluster of simple homes and holiday escapes to the existing vernacular of timber-framed houses owned and built by the established fishing families, who were among the first to settle on the Ness. Updated by inventive owners over the years, the carriage cabins helped to turn Dungeness into a unique micro-resort. “It’s quite a distinct line of carriages, but where ours is a little different is that while all our neighbours have passenger carriages, this is a guard’s van,” says Hampshire. “It has a lantern roof, so the guard could look up and down the line. There is only one other house on Dungeness with a lantern roof like this and the strange thing about Dungeness is that it attracts this weird confluence of nautical enthusiasts and railway enthusiasts, so we have found people standing outside who have been able to name the kind of carriage it is and the model type.” Crucially for the interiors, the lantern skylight draws natural light into the main living spaces, making them bright and welcoming. The cabin had previously been rented out and used as a fish smokery, with the smoked fish sold from the front. The place was certainly in need of some love and attention, but the structure itself proved to be sound. Stephenson and Hampshire updated the electrics and services, installing both central heating and a log-burning stove. The walls of the main living spaces are painted a beach house white, while the original wooden floors have been restored. There’s a mix of midcentury furniture and contemporary pieces, along with Mini Moderns designs. The front hall is decorated with the green and white version of Stephenson and Hampshire’s Dungeness wallpaper, which includes familiar motifs, such as the old lighthouse and the T-shaped navigation aid that looms over the shingle beach. “We call our design ethos ‘pattern with a story’”, says Hampshire. “So everything we do is rooted in some kind of narrative about our lives. Dungeness felt like it was the next chapter that we had to use as the inspiration for a collection and so Dungeness is the hero print in our Hinterland range. We were very aware that Dungeness is a place that changes with the elements, so we wanted the wallpaper to represent a snapshot of what was here when we arrived.” “We love the big skies and the amount of stars that you can see at night is breathtaking,” says Stephenson. “We love it in the summer, of course, but we particularly love the feeling of getting cosy here in the winter and putting the fire on. It’s amazing how dramatic the coast can be during those winter months.” Dungeness: Coastal Architecture by Dominic Bradbury and Rachael Smith (Pavilion, £25) will be published on 5 May",Lifestyle/Life and style,On the right track: a rail carriage becomes a delightful coastal cottage,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/24/lines-of-beauty-turn-this-rail-carriage-into-a-delightful-coastal-cottage
4/24/2022,"Housebuilders are churning out substandard housing schemes with poor living conditions despite councils having the power to block them, according to new research. The National Planning Policy Framework was amended in July to allow councils to refuse “development that is not well designed”. A study by University College London found that the Planning Inspectorate, which hears housebuilders’ appeals, is now three times as likely to back councils who reject developments on design grounds. But it also found that the vast majority of those blocked were in the south-east, suggesting that elsewhere councils were not using the new powers. Professor Matthew Carmona, who carried out the research, said councils depleted by austerity often lacked the in-house design expertise to take on large, well-resourced developers. “Local authorities in the south-east generally deal with more development and are more likely to have their own local design policies and employ urban designers. They are simply more geared up to challenge developers,” he said. “Councils in the south-west, Midlands and north tend to see fewer developments and are more reluctant, and perhaps a little nervous, to call out bad design.” A survey revealed last year that 41% of councils do not employ any urban designers, and 76% lack access to any advice on architecture. The change to the country’s planning rules was part of a package of measures that ministers claimed would ensure new housing was “beautiful and well-designed”. The government is setting up an “Office for Place” to help “communities encourage development they find beautiful, and refuse what they find ugly”. The report, published by the UCL-based Place Alliance, highlights 12 schemes rejected on design grounds since last July. The inspectorate found proposals for an unattractive block of 15 flats on the site of a demolished car park in Crawley in West Sussex would offer “unsatisfactory living conditions”. Some flats had limited natural light and the outside spaces were close to roads and railway lines. Others lacked privacy as windows were next to people passing on a walkway and close to cars queueing on a traffic gyratory system. The inspectorate also backed Braintree district council’s efforts to block two estates on the edges of villages in Essex, where developers were trying to squeeze in large numbers of houses, jarring with houses nearby. Officials also turned down an appeal relating to five tower blocks on the former Westferry newspaper printworks site in east London. It was ruled the scheme – which led to a row about media mogul Richard Desmond’s contact with ministers tasked with planning decisions – would harm appreciation of the Greenwich world heritage site. Carmona said big developers had been getting their way for decades but the tables were starting to turn. “Volume housebuilders have been able to get a lot of poor-quality development past local authorities. But this research shows councils can now be far more confident in their exercise of quality control,” he said. Profits for Britain’s biggest housebuilders have continued to rise despite routinely producing low-quality homes and failing to meet the UK’s estimated housing needs. The UCL researchers rated three-quarters of large developments in England as “mediocre” or “poor” in 2020. They found bland architecture, with estates dominated by access roads and parking spaces at the expense of green areas and playgrounds. Other failings included few public transport links and a lack of amenities such as shops, pubs and cafes. Carmona said it was possible to increase the number of houses built without compromising on the design factors that allow a new community to flourish. “We are in desperate need of housing but it doesn’t mean we should build poorly designed, unsustainable places,” he said.",News/UK news,Councils in England are failing to use new powers to block shoddy housing schemes,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/24/councils-in-england-are-failing-to-use-new-powers-to-block-shoddy-housing-schemes
4/24/2022,"Days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, Olaf Scholz delivered a bombshell of his own. Addressing an extraordinary session of the Bundestag, Germany’s chancellor declared his government would boost defence spending by €100bn (£84bn), suspend the prized Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia and reverse a long-standing ban on transferring arms to conflict zones in order to help Ukraine. The shock announcements, termed a “revolution”, were seen as evidence that Germany, and especially Scholz’s centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD), was definitively turning away from its postwar pacifist tradition. The fact Scholz also pledged to meet Nato’s 2% of GDP defence spending obligation was cited as further proof of a historic shift in Berlin’s thinking about its role in the world. The resulting satisfaction, bordering on smug self-congratulation, evident in Washington, London and Warsaw, was compounded by the ensuing German debate about how to deal with Russia. Leading figures on the left and right conceded the post-Soviet policy of conciliating Moscow, rooted in the SPD’s famed cold war era Ostpolitik, had been fundamentally misconceived. As millions in Ukraine flee merciless bombardment, and incontrovertible evidence emerges of war crimes by Vladimir Putin’s troops, this changed belief that Russia cannot be treated as a normal country with which it is possible to do business as usual is now widely accepted. Yet at the same time, Scholz’s revolutionary fervour seems to be waning. Germany’s refusal to quickly sanction Russian oil and gas exports, on which its industries and households remain heavily dependent, has provoked fierce criticism from western partners, not least Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The influential American commentator Paul Krugman harshly accused Germany of acting as “Putin’s enabler” and being “complicit in mass murder”. Claims by Scholz and industry chiefs that an energy embargo would hurt Europe more than Russia and push Germany into recession are hotly disputed. Critics cite studies that suggest the negative impact would be manageable and short-lived. Yet in a report last week, the Bundesbank warned an embargo could shrink Germany’s economy by 2% and cause a 5% fall in output. Scholz is also under fire abroad, and within his own coalition, for allegedly backsliding on heavy weapons supplies to Ukraine. Bild newspaper reported last week that a list of 15 types of German-made armaments to be offered to Kyiv, including Leopard battle tanks, was reduced to three by the chancellery before being submitted to Ukraine. Zelenskiy’s subsequent pleas were ignored, Bild said. Egged on by some UK media, Boris Johnson is among those pressing Germany to do more. Ugly forces are at work, too. Recent attacks also partly reflect visceral anti-German, anti-EU sentiment on the right, borne of old resentments and rivalry. Donald Trump, notoriously hostile to Scholz’s predecessor, Angela Merkel, often indulged in such Berlin-bashing. Yet it’s fair to say Germany’s policy of Wandel durch Handel (change through trade) lies in tatters in the wake of the invasion. There’s no doubt the 30-year, post-1991 period, when Germany thrived on cheap energy while its diplomats made nice with Putin, is over. It’s certain, too, that Germany has suffered a rude geopolitical awakening. Berlin can no longer duck its wider leadership responsibilities, especially for European security. Pressed on these issues last week, Scholz said his biggest worry was nuclear war with Russia. “I am doing everything I can to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war,” he said. This is eminently sensible. But it’s possible to be too cautious and self-interested – and Scholz is far from getting the balance right.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Germany’s response to the war in Ukraine | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/24/observer-view-germany-response-to-war-in-ukraine
4/24/2022,"To ape Bill Hader’s famous Saturday Night Live character Stefon, the A-League Men’s hottest rivalry is the F3 Derby. Located on a sodden field in Newcastle, the latest edition of this regional rivalry had everything. Twists and turns, emotions bubbling over, VAR disallowing goals, dramatic comebacksand Matt Simon almost coming to blows with a red-carded Daniel Penha. After serving as the unexpected highlight of ALM’s opening round of the 2021-22 season, overshadowing the greater ballyhooed Sydney Derby, punters were incredulous they were forced to wait 153 days for Saturday evening’s rematch between the Central Coast Mariners and Newcastle Jets, a fixture ready to resume its place amongst the pantheon of box office ALM fixtures. Fortunately, the intervening months haven’t seen the two belligerents turn into the basket cases that have largely defined their recent history. Instead, they metamorphosed into two of the ALM’s most intriguing teams. Led by Arthur Papas, 2021-22 has seen the Jets become a neutral’s favourite; going from a name that just sort of existed on more interesting team’s schedules into one of the most entertaining sides in the competition. Sure, their defensive foibles mean they’re capable of collapsing at a moment’s notice and they’ll likely miss finals as a result, but Papas has turned his side into a unit that not only wants the ball but are actually capable of doing something with it. In a league increasingly defined by its pragmatism, the Jets are a breath of fresh air. And even implosions can be entertaining. After the magic of Alen Stajcic’s 2020-21 season was immediately followed by a wave of departures, little was expected from Nick Montgomery’s Mariners heading into this campaign. But ALM’s little engine that could has found a way… again. Though very much still a team that likes to operate on the counter, the Mariners trail only Melbourne City and their gigantic budget for the most goals per game this season and have lost just once in their last eleven games. Boosted by the addition of Jason “Cumdog” Cummings, the emergence of youngsters such as Dan Hall and Jacob Farrell, and the continued presence of Mark Birighitti and Marco Ureña they are getting better as the season goes on and may be a stronger team than last year’s outfit. Could circumstances have been better heading into Saturday? Of course. This was still a meeting of eighth against ninth. The two teams have flaws. Yet given their recent history, the setting could certainly have been a lot worse. During the build-up this game felt like it mattered. It was a game you wanted to watch. And while sequels can often fail to live up to the original, the second F3 Derby of the season delivered the most chaotically entertaining game of the season. Then again, across the opening exchanges, the Mariners might have been of a different opinion. Forced to batten down the hatches, they didn’t register a single touch on the possession stats until the fourth minute and didn’t actually progress the ball into the Jets’ half until the seventh. The Jets were playing some lovely stuff. But Moresche’s 19th-minute strike turned the game on its head and 15 minutes later it was 3-0 (remember, Jet defensive collapses) thanks to a brace from Scottish-born but Socceroo-eligible attacker Jason Cummings, for whom calls for an international cap have gone from meme to reflection of his talent. In normal circumstances, opposition coaches would be reaching for the hairdryer; volume and anger deployed as the kindling in attempts to light a fire under a team. Papas instead opted for the silent treatment at halftime and was promptly rewarded with two goals in the first five minutes of the second stanza. Both sides subsequently exchanged chances but when Savvas Siatravanis pounced on Birighitti’s save of an Archie Goodwin header in the 82nd minute, it appeared a momentous Jets comeback had been completed and the Mariners’ finals hopes dealt a mortal blow. VAR, though, had other plans. Called over to check the replay, Kurt Ams ruled the goal out for a push from Goodwin on Kye Rowles. Papas was furious, Montgomery was in furious agreement, and the Mariners survived. Then, Garang Kuol happened. Brought on after his coach relented in attempting to get Cummings his hat-trick, the 17-year-old struck within two minutes to make it 4-2 and seal the game in the 91st. First Alou and now Garang - just wait until Didi arrives. Thus, as the dust cleared and Simon gave Penha a bit of advice following his 96th-minute red card for throwing frustrated elbows, it was the Mariners that emerged victorious; a 4-2 win that, in the broader ALM context, could prove one of the most significant of the 2021-22 season and its finals race. The best bit? These two will be back in less than two weeks to do it again.
