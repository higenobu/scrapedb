4/12/2022,"Heart inflammation after a Covid jab is not only rare but no more common than after other types of vaccinations, researchers have found. As Covid vaccination programmes began around the world it emerged that some people – particularly young men – subsequently developed myocarditis, a type of inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. While cases were rare, the findings caused concern, with risk of such heart inflammation among the reasons cited by experts in the UK for the delay in expanding the vaccination programme to children. Now research suggests that myopericarditis – an umbrella term that encompasses myocarditis and pericarditis – is not only uncommon after Covid jabs, but the risk of developing it is no greater than that posed by other types of inoculations, such as flu vaccinations. “The overall risk of myopericarditis appears to be no different for this very new group of vaccines against Covid-19 than for traditional vaccines against other pathogens,” the authors write. Writing in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, researchers in Singapore describe how they carried out an analysis of 22 previously published studies, covering more than 405m vaccines doses around the world, that looked at the occurrence of myopericarditis after vaccination. In total, 11 of the studies covered Covid jabs, although many did not consider those under the age of 12 years, while 11 looked at flu, smallpox, polio, and MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations, among others. The results reveal the incidence of myopericarditis is low after a Covid jab, with a mean incidence of about 18 cases per million doses. This is similar to incidence after a flu vaccine and after other types of vaccination. When pooled together, non-Covid jabs had an average incidence of about 56 cases of myopericarditis per million doses. The incidence is also far lower than incidence after the smallpox vaccine – although the authors note studies into the latter were conducted mainly among the US military, which is primarily composed of young men, potentially affecting the results. Myopericarditis after Covid vaccination was relatively more common in the case of mRNA jabs, in younger people, after a second dose , and among men: incidence was 10-fold greater for men than women under 30. However, even among young men, rates of myopericarditis after a Covid jab were comparable to other vaccinations. The authors add the risks of uncommon adverse events such as myopericarditis are outweighed by the benefits of vaccination, noting this includes a lower risk of infection, hospitalisation, severe disease and death from Covid itself. But they suggest the study’s findings may help to tailor policy; for example, boys could be offered non-mRNA Covid jabs, although other issues may also influence such decisions, such as availability of such vaccines. Dr Kollengode Ramanathan of the National University of Singapore, a co-author of the research, said: “These findings are important additions to the conversation when weighing the risk-benefits of Covid-19 vaccination and parents should be informed about the benefits and harms of Covid-19 vaccination, the local risk of exposure to Covid-19 infection at the time, and the risk of myopericarditis from Covid-19 infection itself at the time of vaccination of their adolescent children.” Prof Beate Kampmann, the director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said it was important to take note of the findings but that the main message was myopericarditis after Covid jabs was very rare and no more common than after other vaccines. In addition, she said, the condition settled down with anti-inflammatory treatment. “The risk of heart involvement and serious harm from Covid-19 itself is significantly higher than this rare side-effect, which primarily – and rarely – affects young males,” said Kampmann. Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director at the British Heart Foundation, agreed. “Millions of people around the world have had a Covid vaccine, virtually all without complication,” he said. “Getting Covid-19 can lead to severe illness including heart issues and people who are vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting other serious complications caused by Covid-19.”",News/Society,Heart inflammation after Covid vaccine ‘no more common than after other jabs’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/11/heart-inflammation-after-covid-vaccine-no-more-common-than-after-other-jabs
4/12/2022,"While the rain we’re experiencing isn’t really the run-outside-and-jump-in-puddles kind, few things might be more comforting during this extremely wet season than a pair of gumboots. Fashion stylist Rhys Ripper says growing up on a farm, he found gumboots so handy he would often venture out only in socks, jocks and gumboots. As long as you’ve got gumboots on, he says, “you can run outside and feed the chooks or grab some firewood” without a worry in the world. But not all gumboots are created equal. To avoid, very literally, getting stuck in the mud there are a few features to look out for. The first thing to ensure is that your gumboots have slip-resistant soles and good tread. Tread is the first thing farmer Andrew Joy looks at when assessing a good boot. He says: “Hiking-style treads are preferable because they offer better grip and protection.” The next thing to consider is the length of the boot, do you want Kate Moss at Glastonbury knee-high boots? Or easier to style for the city, ankle-height ones? The first thing to think about is protection. Ripper says knee-high gumboots offer protection for your calves but also, importantly, your trousers. He says, “tucking the pants in is important” for fashion reasons (to show off your boots) but also to “keep your pants dry”. The second is movement. A knee-high boot made of PVC or rubber can compromise your ability to flex your ankle. One way to avoid this is by opting for shorter boots, with neoprene sidewalls. Joy says he wears a “neoprene mid-height style as it provides better manoeuvrability and is not as stiff against the leg”. Knee-high boots can be tricky to take on and off, and sometimes this can compromise the fit around your foot. Michael Hatfield, of safety boot manufacturer Bata Industrials, says you need to find the right balance between the boot being large to get your foot in but still tight enough for a comfortable fit. Podiatrist Tanya Contis says fit is especially important, because if your boots are too loose “you will be inclined to clench your toes to stop your foot from moving around”, which can cause painful blisters and calluses. When contemplating fit, she says: “Your feet will swell throughout the day, so if your boots are snug when you put them on in the morning, chances are by the end of the day they will be too small.” Other things to consider are how supportive and structured the sole is – whether or not it has adequate arch support, and if there is cushioning inside the shoe. Contis’ preference is for ankle-length boots with a neoprene lining. She says the length makes them easier to pull on and off and the lining helps keep the foot insulated. Both of these things are particularly important if you’re buying gumboots for kids. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In terms of materials, gumboots are typically made of either PVC or rubber. Natural rubber tends to be more flexible and comfortable to wear than PVC, and it is more durable, particularly if it’s undergone a hardening called vulcanisation. However, rubber is also much heavier and more expensive than PVC. Hatfield says boots made from PVC are more commonly used for protective gear and can come with features like safety toecaps and anti-penetration midsoles to protect against sharp objects piercing the sole. Ultimately, the right pair of boots will depend on what you need them for. For mid-calf protection, insulation and flexibility through the ankle, Joy recommends the Bogs Classic Ultra Mid Farm ($149.95). The boot is lined with lightweight fabric that will absorb sweat and has been tested in sub-zero temperatures so you can be sure your foot will stay warm and dry. Australian gumboot designers Merry People have made an extremely versatile ankle-length boot. Contis says she has seen the Bobbi Gumboot ($149.95) worn on the farm and in the city, and it comes in a variety of fun colours. If fit is your priority, this is a good option as these boots have arch support and generous tread. They are also lined with neoprene for added warmth and flexibility. Plus Merry People have a super cute kids range. Ripper recommends this stylish but functional knee-high boot by Hunter (approximately $225). The style originated in England in 1956 and has been worn by everyone from Kate Moss to Diana, Princess of Wales. It is made of vulcanised natural rubber and is designed for the rain. For something shorter, Hunter also make a super chic, waterproof Chelsea boot. Penny Scanlan make these short gumboots for kids ($39.95). They have a cotton lining, a slip-resistant sole and a toe guard. The Bata Knee Length Steel Cap Safety Gumboots ($32.50) wear their features in the title. They are made of PVC, have a reinforced heel, a steel toe cap and are resistant to oil and acid. Plus, they are made in Australia.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Make a splash: how to buy the best pair of gumboots,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/12/make-a-splash-how-to-buy-the-best-pair-of-gumboots
4/12/2022,"A pair of YouTubers are facing a lawsuit and a restraining order after allegedly filming themselves disrupting classes at the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles and uploading footage of the staged pranks online. The University of Southern California sued Ernest Kanevsky and Yuguo Bai over the incidents, USC Annenberg Media reported last week. A judge granted a restraining order banning Kanevsky and Bai, who are not USC students, from campus after university attorneys said the pranks had terrorized “students to the point where they are running out of lecture halls for fear of their lives”. The Guardian has contacted Kanevsky and Bai for comment on the lawsuit. The pair have taken over three USC classrooms since last year, the Daily Trojan reported, most recently in March when they disrupted a lecture on the Holocaust. Kanevsky was reportedly dressed as a member of the “Russian mafia”, while Bai posed as Hugo Boss, the designer who made uniforms for the Nazis. Students panicked and fled the classroom. “I was near the door and I started running out,” one student told USC Annenberg Media. “Everyone just left in a really big panic.” Authorities with the university’s public safety department detained the pair. There was a drastic drop in classroom attendance after that incident, the university reported in court documents. “Simply put, there is no public benefit to terrorizing students to the point where they are running out of lecture halls for fear of their lives through the perpetration of prank classroom takeovers in order to garner a handful of likes on YouTube,” USC lawyers stated in court papers, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. On other occasions Kanevsky and Bai escorted a professor out of a classroom and dressed as characters from the Netflix show Squid Game. USC had requested a temporary restraining order, which a judge granted, and is also seeking damages for attorney fees and other costs associated with the lawsuit. The pair “provoked extreme fear and anxiety”, the university said, causing students to experience “emotional distress and genuine fear for their personal wellbeing; against the national background of active shooter concerns on college campuses”. Eric Kanevsky has more than 100,000 followers on YouTube and regularly posts prank videos, which have garnered more than 8m views. The videos of the incidents at USC appear to have been deleted, but other videos depict Kanevsky staging similar pranks at other southern California college campuses, including the University of California, Los Angeles, and California State University, Long Beach. In a video uploaded in March 2021, Kanevsky, dressed as what he describes as a “Russian gangster” poses as a professor in a class at CSU, Long Beach. He takes what appears to be a drink of alcohol before reviewing classroom rules and expectations, and lights a cigarette, but is eventually disrupted by university officials. The university said at the time that it was considering legal action against Kanevsky.",News/US news,California university sues YouTubers who allegedly filmed disruptive pranks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/11/california-university-sues-youtubers-over-disruptive-pranks
4/12/2022,"The day after the craziness and pulse a little closer to resting levels Pep Guardiola did as he always does. The Manchester City manager looked into his laptop to run through the forensic debrief and he pressed pause. Guardiola would have done so in the 73rd minute of the 2-2 thriller with Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium when Gabriel Jesus worked an opening to the right of goal. Kevin De Bruyne was on for the cut-back. Just pass it to Kevin. But no. Jesus still shoots into the side net and 50,000 voices still scream at him – most vociferously that of De Bruyne. The moment that had haunted Guardiola after the game, which he referenced with such overt frustration, would not have looked any better, either. Phil Foden to De Bruyne to Riyad Mahrez, the substitute, in the 94th minute. Pause. The first-time touch into Foden still looks on, although Mahrez has clearly made up his mind to jink inside. Pause again. The pass to Foden appears an even better bet now. Play. Mahrez still sends the chipped shot high. Guardiola understood. For him there can be no recriminations, particularly not after such a dynamic team performance; a day when he got so much right, including his selection of Jesus and Raheem Sterling in the front line. Their runs in behind the Liverpool defence caused all manner of problems, testing the recovery pace of the centre-halves and even making Virgil van Dijk look a little edgy at times. “I make ‘pause’ … the game stops, nobody moves … don’t pass the ball there,” Guardiola said. “But in football, they have to make a decision in half a second. And it’s difficult, always. My reaction on the bench … Aaargh, how we don’t do it? Hands moving around. But after, I understand them. It’s difficult sometimes and, in the final third, in the box, it’s the most difficult position.” Guardiola talked about a missed opportunity, how City had allowed Liverpool to remain alive in the Premier League title race when they might have killed them. But the over-riding feeling has been one of satisfaction, of confidence for the battles ahead – the next of which comes at Atlético Madrid on Wednesday night in the Champions League quarter-final; City are 1-0 up from the first leg. Then it is Liverpool again in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. And who knows? It could yet be City v Liverpool in the Champions League final. There has been much said and written about Jürgen Klopp’s nine career victories against Guardiola teams; four of which came when the Liverpool manager was in charge at Borussia Dortmund and Guardiola was at Bayern Munich. No manager has won more against Guardiola. For the record Guardiola also has nine victories while there have now been five draws. But Guardiola has been the boss over the past four seasons, winning four of the nine contests in all competitions and losing only one. On Sunday his players made many more good decisions than bad; they created plenty and gave up relatively little. There was a parallel to the 2-2 draw at Anfield from earlier in the season in that City might have been out of sight at half-time. Yes, the profligacy at the big moments is a worry but more important is that the moments are being created. Guardiola knows it is about the performance levels and so does De Bruyne, who is in electric form. “We played a good game and we deserved to win,” he said. “But in the end we take it. They have quality and we did not give too much away.” What was clear from within the City camp was how much they respected Liverpool for coming to play, which was in stark contrast to the approach of Atlético from the previous Tuesday. The Spanish team did not muster a single shot during the first leg. “Against Atlético … where you play against such a defensive wall, it is not the best game to play or watch,” De Bruyne said. “There’s nothing we can do about it. If a team comes here to play, it is always a good game and Liverpool come here to play the way they play.” Atlético will plainly present a different challenge and, for City, the schedule is unforgiving. Pause and recover on Monday. Travel on Tuesday. No time to train, as Guardiola says. Then play. It will be the same routine leading up to the FA Cup semi-final. Guardiola is conscious that Liverpool are at home in their Champions League quarter-final, second leg on Wednesday night against Benfica. “I could say: ‘Oh, thank you so much Premier League … you could give us an extra day,” Guardiola says. “But how? In this country, it’s impossible. And I love that because it will show whether you can overcome the bad moments and play.” De Bruyne is also in the groove. “It would be nice to think about the end of the season [title run-in] but you don’t get the time,” he says. “That is maybe a good thing because you just play, play, play and then we will see what happens. I think the Atlético game will be a little bit tight at the beginning but it has to change if the score stays the same. I don’t expect it to be a similar game to the first leg.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola presses pause to focus on Manchester City’s battles ahead | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/guardiola-presses-pause-to-focus-on-manchester-citys-battles-ahead
4/12/2022,"Andy Robertson insists Liverpool have to be “ready to pounce” should Manchester City drop points as the title race enters its closing seven matches. Sunday’s thrilling 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium leaves City a point ahead of Jürgen Klopp’s team and for all associated with Liverpool, there may be a feeling that this season will replicate the 2018-19 campaign when both sides kept winning during the home straight and it was ultimately Pep Guardiola’s men who triumphed, 98 points to 97. “We just need to keep winning games,” said Robertson. “We had to do it that year and we have to do it this year. It’s obviously out of our hands, if they win all their games then it is their league but if they do drop points we need to be ready to pounce. The only way of doing that is by winning games, if we do that then let’s see where we end up in May.” City’s run-in sees them play Brighton, Watford, Leeds, Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa plus a rearranged meeting with Wolves. Liverpool’s schedule takes in Manchester United, Everton, Newcastle, Tottenham, Villa, Southampton and Wolves. Asked if City have the easier set of remaining games, Robertson added: “We can only focus on ourselves. I think we have got a really tough run-in, all games are tough in the Premier League especially when you get to the end bit. But we have some really tough games and we need to try to win them, we need to be at our best, we need to be better than we were [against City] and if we do that then let’s see where we end up and hopefully we can win something. If not, we will give it our best shot. “Time will tell [if we need to win them all]. You never know. We need to win as many games as it takes – it’s as simple as that. We wait to see what results happen, we need to keep dealing with each game as it comes.” Liverpool host Benfica in Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-finalsecond leg, holding a 3-1 advantage from the first tie in Lisbon, before facing City again in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Robertson offered a simple formula regarding how players approach such an intensive period. “Just keep focusing on the next one,” said the left-back. “We are already focused on Benfica now. We have a lead but we need to get through. We need to try to win that and then get into the semi-finals. If we do that then we focus on the next one. We are still fighting on all fronts, we still have a lot of games to play and if we win hopefully it ends with silverware.”",Sport/Football,Andy Robertson insists Liverpool ‘ready to pounce’ if Manchester City slip up,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/andy-robertson-insists-liverpool-ready-to-pounce-if-manchester-city-slip-up
