5/4/2022,"As the president weighs broad student loan forgiveness, some Americans expressing frustration over a policy they see as unfair. ""While some may view this debt forgiveness as a slap in the face to people who were responsible and paid off their student loans, this is a bigger slap in the face to those Americans who never went to college,"" Will Bach, a financial advisor based in Ohio, told Yahoo Finance. Research has shown that a college degree generally boosts an individual's earnings over their lifetime. And given that any broad-based forgiveness would cost tens of billions of dollars, all taxpayers — not just by those who have a college degree — would be contributing to the cost of cancellation. ""How can we honestly ask people who did not go to college to subsidize the lives of those who did decide to go to college?"" Bach added. ""To my knowledge, everyone with student loans voluntarily took them. Every instance of a student loan was a voluntary choice that person made."" Some right-leaning academics, including Andrew Gillen of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, argue that there are a variety of problems with cancelling student loan debt. These include the overall cost and the fact that forgiveness does not directly address the core issue of rising college costs. Cancelling $10,000 or $50,000 across the board is ""really badly targeted,"" Gillen said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. ""There there are people who are struggling to repay their debt, and we've got an existing set of solutions — and those solutions aren't working,"" he acknowledged, such as the massive failure of the income-driven repayment system. At the same time, he added, any broad-based forgiveness would be like saying that ""a handful of people that are struggling here, [so] let's get rid of the debt for everybody."" An income cap on who qualified for any loan forgiveness would be a ""no brainer,"" Gillen added, because it would help target the relief towards lower-income struggling debtors. Biden is reportedly considering capping forgiveness to those who earned less than $125,000 or $150,000 as individual filers the previous year, The Washington Post reported recently. For couples filing jointly, the cap would be around $250,000 or $300,000. ""The other thing that would also be a no-brainer is having different criteria for graduate loans than you do for undergraduate loans,"" Gillen said, ""because we really do restrict how much you can borrow at the undergraduate level ... whereas at graduate level, because those students can borrow virtually without limit."" The proposal ""is nothing more than a welfare program for the upper class,"" Bach said. ""The people who have responsibly saved and paid for college will not benefit from this at all."" Bach, who worked as a police officer for five years after college, added that he took on student loans to pay for his MBA in finance and paid it off within a few years of graduating. He currently is a certified financial planner and financial adviser. Advocates pushed back against critics of Biden's plans to cancel debt. “I'm sorry we weren’t able to win cancel student debt sooner,"" Melissa Byrne, a political organizer and an activist pushing for student debt cancellation, told Yahoo Finance. ""I'm sorry that political operatives in the '70s and the '80s caved to Ronald Reagan and let folks defund higher education. ... But I'm not sorry we’re about to hopefully get a win now."" Louise Seamster, a sociologist at the University of Iowa, told Yahoo Finance that the group pushing back against cancellation is not a large one and asked them to put themselves in student debtors' shoes. ""As a sociologist, my work involves teaching students to consider how their own experiences are shaped by larger forces,"" Seamster said in an email to Yahoo Finance. ""As such, I would encourage people who have been lucky enough to pay down their debt to reflect on what factors allowed them to pay down their debt: maybe attending school when public education was actually affordable; the support of a partner or family; or graduating into a favorable economy."" She added that critics ""might have made career choices that prioritized income, but I hope they think what our society would look like if everyone had made those same choices and who would be educating their children or providing them medical care."" Some studies have shown that women and people of color take on more debt to go to college compared to their white male peers. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) has repeatedly argued that student loan forgiveness is ""a matter of racial and economic justice"" given the disproportionate burden on borrowers of color. ""Canceling student debt is one of the most powerful ways to address racial and economic equity issues,"" a recent letter from prominent Democrats, including Pressley, asserted to the president. ""The student loan system mirrors many of the inequalities that plague American society and widens the racial wealth gap. Black students in particular borrow more to attend college, borrow more often while they are in school, and have a harder time paying their debt off than their white peers."" Seamster added that if Americans still feel like cancellation of debt is unfair, ""I invite them to join the movement for free college to make the same public higher education benefits available to all and make student debt itself unnecessary."" Bach said he doubted that forgiving debt would help the economy, and that it was an opportunity for Democrats to gain clout with voters. ""I don't think there is any evidence that this is going to help with the U.S. economy or student debt holders,"" he said. ""This is simply a Hail Mary for President Biden who has just hit a 40% approval rating with the younger population."" The political benefit seems to be one thing both sides agree on: In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Pressley stated that ""Democrats win when we deliver, and we have to deliver in ways that are impactful, tangible and transformative, like canceling student debt. This is good policy. And it is also good politics."" Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. She can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com. Follow her on Twitter @aarthiswami.

5/4/2022,"Black people are less likely than white people to receive CPR from a bystander after going into cardiac arrest at home or in a public place, a new report shows. About 1,000 Americans’ hearts stop beating suddenly each day, according to American Heart Association. Research shows one out 10 people who experience cardiac arrest out of the hospital will likely survive. Black people have lower survival rates, however, compared to white people, research also shows. Bystander CPR could increase those chances of survival. “When somebody goes down, one of the most important critical things you can do that can save lives is to start CPR,” Dr. Paul Chan, a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri and one of the authors of the study, said. According to the study that was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s (ACC) 71st Annual Scientific Session, Blacks and Hispanics are 26 percent less likely to receive CPR from a bystander than whites when they go into cardiac arrest at home. The gap was even wider in public. The study shows Blacks and Hispanics had a 41 percent lower likelihood of receiving CPR from a bystander than their white counterparts. Chan said disparities in treatment have been historically unaddressed. He attributes the gap in treatment to a lack of CPR training in Black communities. However, it does not explain why white people are also more likely to receive CPR than Blacks and Hispanics in their own neighborhoods. “The elephant in the room is how much is race or racism playing a role in decisions about responding to somebody in trouble when it occurs in public,” Chan said. Researchers examined more than 110,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests from 2013 to 2019 and compared them to bystander CPR rates. About 80 percent of the minority cohort were Black, Chan said. The data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival shows a white person going into cardiac arrest in a neighborhood where the population is more than 50 percent Black and the Hispanic was still more likely to get bystander CPR than a Black or Hispanic person who lives in that neighborhood. While the study did not examine why the racial difference is prevalent in both white and minority neighborhoods, Chan notes that implicit bias or explicit bias most likely plays a part. “Maybe when a white person collapses in a Black or Hispanic community, there are fewer assumptions about why they collapsed and what they need,” said Chan, who dedicates part of his work to Black and minority communities. The research doctor also noted he does not have enough information to draw a conclusion, and the questions raised by the study have often gone unanswered. “It’s usually somebody you don’t know. It’s somebody you’re walking by and you see somebody collapse in the streets,” Chan said. “It turns out that there may be a component of implicit if not explicit bias, and that may not just be harbored by individuals in white communities. There are issues of public safety, and I think everybody has some biases about individuals in their own communities.” Rates of CPR training are undoubtedly lower in Black neighborhoods. In 2013, Chan and his colleagues found the annual rate of CPR training was lower in the counties in the South, those with higher proportions of rural areas, and of Black and Hispanic residents. Chan said CPR training would be more accessible if it was free, especially in poorer neighborhoods. However, free CPR classes would not make a difference until Black residents understand how critical the life-saving technique is. It first needs to be “normalized” in Black communities, he said. But despite the glaring disparity, the American Red Cross, the American Heart Association and other health care organizations do not market CPR training to Black or brown people. “Most of the pictures depict white mannequins and white responders,” Chan said. “I think we need to start thinking and discussing more critically and creatively about making sure that we balance the playing field.” One way to address the issue, Chan said, is to bring CPR to where people already gather in neighborhoods, such as churches or barbershops. The approach also needs to be widespread, he said. “I think that it needs to be systematic effort and a coordinated effort to really make CPR training more accessible,” Chan said. The health community has made similar strides in tackling health care disparities. The American Heart Association has an initiative called the Hair, Heart & Health that trains barbers and hairstylists to screen their clients’ blood pressure and obesity levels in their shops to help detect those at risk for heart disease and stroke and other diseases. Anthony Pettiford, owner of United Barbershop in Greensboro, said the program created an opening to educate Black men about the importance of preventative care. “Once you bring awareness, hopefully they pick up or may become concerned about their own personal health,” Pettiford said. “You try to put that on the floor to let them know the importance of health.” Still, Chan pointed out that training can only cure the racial gap that may exist at home and not in public settings. “We need to have a broader conversation about biases,” Chan said.",Health/Atlanta Black Star,‘The Elephant In the Room’: Study Shows Black People Have a Lower Chance of Getting CPR from Bystanders In and Out of Their Own Community,https://news.yahoo.com/elephant-room-study-shows-black-151900846.html
