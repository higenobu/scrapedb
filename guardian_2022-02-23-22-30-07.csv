2/23/2022,"Leonardo DiCaprio has bought an equity stake in the French champagne house Telmont, its majority owner Rémy Cointreau has announced. The Hollywood A-lister and environmental activist, 47, said he was drawn to the 100-year-old brand based in Damery due to its ecological credentials.  “From protecting biodiversity on its land, to using 100% renewable electricity, Champagne Telmont is determined to radically lower its environmental footprint, making me proud to join as an investor,” the star of Titanic, Inception and Don’t Look Up said. Telmont was founded in 1912 near Épernay in northern France by local winegrower Henri Lhôpital in the wake of the Champagne Riots – a series of disturbances caused by four years of bad harvests. In 1911, he wrote the song Gloire au Champagne, the lyrics of which urged winemakers to uphold the high standards of quality that went into making the sparkling beverage. His son, Andre Lhôpital, took over as cellar master following his father’s death in 1937. Two years later, he joined the second regiment of the Cuirassiers, the oldest surviving calavry regiment in the French army, dating back to the 17th century. Telmont’s logo – a knight’s helmet – honours the Cuirassiers insignia. The French drinks company, Rémy Cointreau, bought a majority stake in Telmont in October 2020. DiCaprio’s investment is the latest in a series of celebrity endorsements for luxury brands attempting to entice younger customers. In February 2021, LVMH’s Moët Hennessy bought a 50% stake in rap star Jay-Z’s Armand de Brignac champagne brand. Last year, Lady Gaga and Dom Pérignon teamed up to create The Queendom, a limited-edition rosé. She also designed 110 custom sculptures to be sold exclusively at the brand’s flagship stores. Fashion designer Vera Wang partnered with Chopin vodka to create a gluten-free version of the spirit in a uniquely designed bottle. Meanwhile, a growing number of A-list stars have turned to creating alcohol brands of their own. Brad Pitt released the second bottling of his rosé champagne, Fleur de Miraval, ahead of the festive season in 2021. The first bottles debuted in 2020 for around $400 (£295) a piece. Actor Jamie Foxx released his own Brown Sugar Bourbon spirit company to critical acclaim in 2018. Model Kendall Jenner spent four years working on her own tequila brand, 818, which debuted in May last year.",News/Business,Leonardo DiCaprio buys stake in green-friendly champagne house,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/leonardo-dicaprio-buys-stake-in-green-friendly-champagne-house
2/23/2022,"Passengers will no longer need to wear masks on the tube and other transport in the capital from Thursday, Transport for London has announced. TfL said it would continue to strongly recommend masks are worn but would no longer make them mandatory.  The change comes into effect at the same time as laws requiring self-isolation for people with coronavirus are lifted in England by Boris Johnson. TfL has previously continued to make mask-wearing a “condition of carriage” on London Underground and other services, even when the government said they were no longer a legal requirement. However, compliance rates dropped without the threat of enforcement by police or fixed penalty notices. The legal requirement in England to wear masks on transport and other public settings, reimposed during the Omicron surge, was dropped in late January. TfL said that face coverings had been shown to reduce transmission of Covid and boost passenger confidence in using public transport. The tube was one of the most affected forms of transport at the start of the pandemic, with passenger numbers falling to as little as 4% of normal levels. By last week tube numbers had returned to about 60% of pre-pandemic levels on weekdays, and London bus ridership to about 75%. Lilli Matson, TfL’s chief safety, health and environment officer, said: “Following the government’s decision to lift coronavirus restrictions, and the falling infection rates in London, we will be removing the condition of carriage that requires customers to wear face coverings from 24 February, but will continue to strongly recommend that customers and staff wear them as they are proven to reduce the risk of transmission and we know they provide confidence to people using public transport.” TfL said independent testing by Imperial College London carried out monthly since September 2020 had no found traces of coronavirus on touch points in stations and on buses, and revealed that the whole transport network was well ventilated. London TravelWatch said its latest surveys showed 69% of people felt safer using public transport when passengers wore face coverings. Its chief executive, Emma Gibson, said: “We also know that this figure is even higher for older people and those who use public transport more regularly.” Mask-wearing in public indoor settings remains compulsory until late March in Scotland. It is also mandatory on public transport in Wales, while in Northern Ireland it is recommended. Airlines will continue to require masks.",News/UK news,Transport for London drops rules on compulsory face masks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/23/transport-for-london-drops-rules-on-compulsory-face-masks

In 2020, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein were due to commence a speaking tour; there was also an archival box set of their complete discography due. But good things come to those who wait, and 2022 looks to be a banner year for the historic new wave group. The In Conversation tour is back on in November. The box set – with extensive new liner notes and essays – is coming soon, along with a graphic novel offering a unique retelling of the band’s storied history.

2/23/2022,"Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the western response to Vladimir Putin’s growing list of crimes has been to impose sanctions on his “cronies”. In recent years there have been particularly insistent demands for sanctions on rich Russian oligarchs resident in London. So the UK government’s response this week to Putin’s recognition of the separatist republics in Ukraine’s Donbas region took the usual form: sanctions against five Russian banks and three oligarchs.  The cries went up at once: not enough! Why not Abramovich? What happened to the unexplained wealth orders, recent legal tools intended to expose and punish money-launderers? On this site the Labour MP Chris Bryant demanded much tougher action against the Russian oligarchs who abuse British laws to buy property here and hide their ill-gotten gains. Despite the furore, we rarely pause to ask some very simple questions: are these measures actually the right sanctions? Are they targeting the right people? And, crucially, have they ever had any effect on Putin’s behaviour? The answer to all three questions is no. First, imposing sanctions on oligarchs has little effect on Russian policy. Some Russian oligarchs are close to Putin, and some of them probably help hide his wealth in offshore accounts. Putin uses them to finance projects that he needs done quickly – infrastructure for the Sochi Olympics, a bridge to annexed Crimea. But it is an entirely one-way relationship. Putin allows them to prosper on two conditions: that they cough up the cash when he needs it, and that they stay out of politics. The idea that they influence his policies is pure fantasy. The proof of that is that sanctions regularly meted out on oligarchs since 2014 have made not one jot of difference to Putin’s policies. The west imposed sanctions over Crimea, the downing of a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine and the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. None of them elicited so much as an expression of regret, far less a change of course. What they did do, of course, was deepen Putin’s already simmering hatred of the west. Of course, money launderers who profit from the UK’s lax regime should be exposed and prosecuted. But not all of them are Russian. And none of them have a say in Kremlin decision-making – certainly not in his foreign policies. You only had to look at the quaking members of Putin’s security council on Monday, as they were forced to stand one by one at a lectern and profess their support for his decision to recognise the Donbas republics, to understand that Putin takes orders from no one. Not from his closest political team, and certainly not from rich Russians based in London. The only real value in punishing oligarchs is that it makes the west feel and look good because it is doing something. Economic sanctions – cancelling the Nordstream II gas pipeline, or restricting Russia’s access to the Swift system – may have a greater effect, but they may also rebound on us in the form of higher energy prices. However, there is a much bolder and more imaginative approach. Russia’s ruling class – the members of the Duma, the Senate, the presidential council, the top echelons of the security and defence services, top state television employees – is several thousands strong. These men (and some women) draft, rubber-stamp, promote and carry out Putin’s decisions. Some of them also – unlike the oligarchs – actually advise him. Being a member of the Duma or Senate is a pretty cushy number – you are well-paid, you can make an occasional speech if you wish, but you are basically there to vote for the Kremlin’s decisions, and, above all, you can extort as many bribes as you can cope with. (For this reason they are detested by a majority of Russians.) Members of the presidential council are civil servants, essential for the preparation of legislation. The security services play crucial roles in executing Putin’s vision. And TV propagandists spread disinformation. These are the people to target – because when several thousand of the people Putin actually depends on begin to feel the consequences of his policies in their personal lives, there will be a groundswell of discontent. Most of these people love to travel to Europe and the US. They educate their children here. They own properties here. The members of the Russian elite, their families and children, love to swan around on yachts, ski slopes and fine hotels in the west, posting pictures of themselves on Instagram. If they are denied visas to travel to the west – if they are effectively imprisoned in Russia – it will not take long for the discontent to permeate the entire political class. The message to them will be clear: if you want to enjoy your western lifestyles, you need a new leader who respects western values; until then, you’re banned. The added value of this approach is that, unlike some economic sanctions, it will not harm ordinary Russians, in fact it will delight them. If any kind of sanctions are going to have an effect, it is these. Forget the oligarchs; go for the political elite. Angus Roxburgh is a former BBC Moscow correspondent and consultant to the Kremlin.

2/23/2022,"A man who stalked and harassed the British tennis star Emma Raducanu has been given a five-year restraining order and sentenced to community service. Amrit Magar, 35, who said he had walked 23 miles to the US Open champion’s home in London and then took her father’s shoe – thinking it belonged to Raducanu – as a souvenir, was found guilty of stalking at Bromley magistrates court last month.  Magar, from Harrow in north-east London, turned up at the property on three separate occasions between 1 November and 4 December last year, the court heard. He loitered outside, left unwanted gifts and cards and stole items from the porch. A bouquet of flowers he left included a note that read: “Nothing to say but you deserve love.” There was also a self-drawn map to show the “23 miles” he had walked from his home. Magar was arrested after Raducanu’s father, Ian, was alerted by a doorbell camera, finding his trainer had been stolen from the porch. In a statement to the court, Raducanu, 19, said the ordeal had left her feeling afraid to go out alone. “Since all this has happened I have felt creeped out. I feel very apprehensive if I go out, especially if I am on my own,” the British No 1 said in a statement reported by the Mail. “Because of this I feel like my freedom has been taken away from me. I am constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel on edge and worried this could happen again. I don’t feel safe in my own home, which is where I should feel safest.” Magar found her address by travelling to the London suburb where she lives with her parents and asking people for directions. On his last visit to the property in early December, he decorated a tree in the front garden with Christmas lights. He was caught by Raducanu’s father, who recognised Magar from previous visits and followed him by car while calling the police. The tennis player told police: “I want to move to a new house with better security because I am worried he might come back as he knows where my home is.” Magar was given a five-year restraining order and an 18-month community order, including 200 hours of unpaid work and an eight-week curfew between 9pm and 6am monitored by an electronic tag.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu stalker given five-year restraining order,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/emma-raducanu-stalker-five-year-restraining-order-tennis-star
2/23/2022,"Five years ago, this publication’s Sam Knight wrote a long read entitled ‘London Bridge is down’; a sombre, forensic examination of what will happen in the immediate aftermath of the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Knight explained that the news will break in an orderly, frictionless way. First to government officials via codeword, then to the BBC and the Press Association and finally a black-edged notice pinned to the gates of Buckingham Palace. When it happens, it will be well rehearsed and highly organised. What Sam Knight didn’t predict, however, was that the news of the Queen’s death would be exclusively leaked to a celebrity news blog run by a man best known for having a bit-part in a spin-off to a VH1 reality hip-hop dating show. But, hey, nobody gets everything right all the time.  To be clear, as far as anyone in the world knows at the moment, the Queen hasn’t died. But that didn’t stop Hollywood Unlocked – a blog run by Love & Hip Hop star Jason Lee (not to be confused with the Jason Lee from the Alvin and the Chipmunks movies) – from announcing it on Tuesday night. “Socialites,” the offending post began, “it is with our deepest regret to inform you that Britain’s Queen Elizabeth has died. Sources close to the Royal Kingdom notified us exclusively that Queen Elizabeth has passed away. She was scheduled to attend the wedding of British Vogue editor Edward Enninful, but was found dead”. Now, clearly, there’s a lot to unpack here. The claim that the Queen was “found dead”, as if she wandered off into Hyde Park to be discovered by a dog walker, suggests a lack of expertise on the subject. As does the phrase “sources close to the Royal Kingdom”, because that technically describes anyone who lives in or around the UK. Last, it seems fairly unlikely that the Queen was headed to Enninful’s wedding, since most reports claim that the guestlist for that event is reserved for all the myriad Beckhams and Delevingnes. Nevertheless, Lee is sticking to his guns. On Instagram, in the wake of Hollywood Unlocked’s post, he uploaded a note reading: “1. I’ve never lied. 2. I’ve never been wrong. 3. I trust my sources. 4. I have yet to see an official statement from the palace saying otherwise. 5. I’ll be at the Donda concert tonight with Ye.” And this sets up an extraordinary battle between the might of the British monarchy and a blogger who nobody knew about until 18 hours ago. If he’s wrong, his reputation will be in shreds. But if he happens to be right, an entire constitutional handover decades in the making will be derailed from the off. It will mean that the British population will have to entirely recalibrate its expectations for major events. If Queen Elizabeth’s death really was broken on a C-list celebrity blog, then what can we expect next? Will we learn about the death of Prince Charles through a sequence of emojis on Snapchat? Will it be exclusively revealed by a novelty cat account on TikTok? It doesn’t bear thinking about. And what of Buckingham Palace now? Does it have to officially deny a blogpost on the internet? Will we soon be greeted with the image of Queen Elizabeth doing a thumbs-up next to a copy of today’s newspaper to demonstrate that she’s alive and kicking? You’d think not, because that would set a ridiculous precedent. Anyone could claim that she had died, and the palace would be forced to deny everything. It isn’t a very dignified way to spend the winter of your years. In fairness to Lee, if you’re going to pick anyone to be the subject of a spurious death hoax, a nonagenarian with Covid does seem like the safest bet. However, all signs currently point to him being wrong. Which isn’t to say that should completely discount Hollywood Unlocked, of course.

2/23/2022,"Mikel Arteta expects Jack Wilshere to return to Arsenal as a coach and says the club will “open the doors” to a role when the midfielder has finished his playing career. Wilshere signed for the Danish side Aarhus last Sunday, having been without an employer since leaving Bournemouth in June. He had been training for most of the season at Arsenal, where he made 207 appearances before leaving in 2018, while taking his coaching badges and Arteta would like to find him a position in the long term.  “One hundred per cent,” he said when asked whether Wilshere would come back one day in a coaching capacity. “Everybody at the club will be willing to open the doors to him to try and find a role for him that can work for everybody. I think that will happen naturally.” Alongside training, Wilshere was involved with Arsenal’s under-23 coaching setup during his recent spell. Arteta explained that the 30-year-old, a former teammate who he described as an “absolute pleasure” to have worked with again, had not been sure about continuing as a player but said his immersion in an upwardly mobile first-team squad had reignited his desire. “Hopefully we have helped him a bit because he had some doubts whether to start coaching or continue playing,” he said. “I think this group of players have given him that necessity to feel again on a daily basis how magnificent it is to feel like a football player.” Arsenal face Wolves on Thursday in a game rescheduled from the height of the Omicron outbreak. The pair sit sixth and seventh in the Premier League, although Arsenal have a game in hand and are two points clear of Bruno Lage’s side. They also won 1-0 at Molineux this month and, with fourth place comfortably in their sights given Manchester United’s extra games played, see an opportunity to hammer home their case. Arteta knows the importance of a second home win in the space of six days, after Saturday’s victory over Brentford, but accepts there will be twists and turns to come. “I think it will be a bit of a rollercoaster,” he said. “There will be moments when a team opens up a bit of a gap, then it catches up. You see the fixtures we all have to play and they are extremely tricky, we will see. [The players] know what every game means for us, we know where we are and that race is going right until the end.” It will be Wolves’ first visit to the Emirates since November 2020, when Raúl Jiménez fractured his skull and was knocked unconscious after a sickening clash of heads with the then Arsenal defender David Luiz. Jiménez spent eight months out but has returned and should start on Thursday. Arteta saw it from the sidelines and, asked whether that was the scariest moment of his career, said: “Yeah, I have had others but that was one of them. Straight away you see the reaction, the anxiety that suddenly is in the team doctors and everybody involved trying to assess what was happening. It was frightening. Thank God it ended the right way, but it looked really, really bad.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta expects Jack Wilshere to make Arsenal return as coach,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/mikel-arteta-arsenal-expects-jack-wilshere-return-as-coach
2/23/2022,"Further details of the animosity between Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy have been detailed in a new book about the making of George Miller’s 2015 action blockbuster Mad Max: Fury Road. The co-stars were known to have a frosty relationship through the lengthy shoot in the Namibian desert, but Kyle Buchanan’s new book Blood, Sweat & Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road suggests Theron felt sufficiently threatened to require on-set protection from the “aggressive” Hardy.  Hardy starred as the title character in the film, played by Mel Gibson in the original trilogy. Theron was newcomer Imperator Furiosa, a lieutenant to the villain Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who turns against her leader to collaborate with Max while escorting young women to safety. Speaking to Buchanan, Theron and other crew members allege a litany of unprofessional behaviour on the part of Hardy, including persistent lateness causing his co-workers to wait for hours on set. In one instance, Hardy was due on set at 8am, along with the rest of the cast and crew required that day. They included Theron, then a new mother whose baby was in childcare nearby while she worked. Despite producers having made a “special request” for Hardy be punctual, he was more than three hours late, during which time Theron remained in position, ready to shoot. “She was really going to make a point,” recalled camera operator Mark Goellnicht. “She didn’t go to the bathroom, didn’t do anything. She just sat in the War Rig.” When Hardy finally arrived, Theron asked Hardy: “How disrespectful are you?” and said the producers should “fine the fucking cunt a hundred thousand dollars for every minute that he’s held up this crew”. Hardy responded by “charging up to her” and saying: “What did you say to me?” Goellnicht said Hardy seemed “quite aggressive” and that Theron “really felt threatened.” “That was the turning point, because then she said, ‘I want someone as protection.’” Theron added: “It got to a place where it was kind of out of hand, and there was a sense that maybe sending a woman producer down could maybe equalise some of it, because I didn’t feel safe. “I don’t want to make excuses for bad behaviour, but it was a tough shoot. Now, I have a very clear perspective on what went down. I don’t think I had that clarity when we were making the movie. I was in survival mode; I was really scared shitless.” However, the producer assigned to Theron, Denise Di Novi, was barred from set by producer Doug Mitchell, meaning that Theron “still felt pretty naked and alone” on set. “You understand the needs of a director who wants to protect his set, but when push comes to shove and things get out of hand, you have to be able to think about that in a bigger sense,” Theron continued. “That’s where we could have done better, if George trusted that nobody was going to come and fuck with his vision but was just going to come and help mediate situations.” Miller’s actions led to “several weeks on that movie where I wouldn’t know what was going to come my way, and that’s not necessarily a nice thing to feel when you’re on your job. It was a little bit like walking on thin ice.” Miller said he felt “disappointment about the process” and added: “Looking back, if I had to do it again, I would probably be more mindful.” The contributors to Buchanan’s book broadly agree that the friction between Theron and Hardy might have perversely helped the on-screen tension, but was largely the product of bull-headedness on Hardy’s part. Assistant cameraman Ricky Schamburg called Hardy “very provocative” and Theron the opposite, while key second assistant director Samantha McGrady called Theron “the easiest person to deal with”. “Boy fucking howdy, was it clear that those two people hated each other,” said editor J Houston Yang. “They didn’t want to touch each other, they didn’t want to look at each other, they wouldn’t face each other if the camera wasn’t actively rolling.” Co-star Nicholas Hoult likened the on-set atmosphere to being “on your summer holidays and the adults in the front of the car are arguing”; a comparison Theron agreed with: “It was horrible! We should not have done that; we should have been better. I can own up to that.” Hardy responded by saying he was “in over my head in many ways”. “The pressure on both of us was overwhelming at times. What she needed was a better, perhaps more experienced partner in me. That’s something that can’t be faked. I’d like to think that now that I’m older and uglier, I could rise to that occasion.” The Guardian has contacted Hardy’s representatives for further comment.Relations between Theron and Hardy thawed slightly as the shoot progressed and the plot involved the pair becoming closer, with Goellnicht crediting the change to Hardy being “such a method actor that I think he took the arc in the literal sense.” Miller’s film won six awards at the 2016 Oscars. A further film in the series will explore the backstory of Furiosa with Anya Taylor-Joy taking over the role in place of Theron.",Arts/Film,Charlize Theron ‘felt so threatened’ by Tom Hardy making Mad Max she required on-set protection,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/charlize-theron-tom-hardy-mad-max-fury-road-book
