4/14/2022,"The celebrated Italian photojournalist Letizia Battaglia, best known for her work documenting the mafia and their victims in Sicily, has died aged 87. Armed only with her Leica camera and mounted on a Vespa, Battaglia scoured the alleyways of Palermo during the 1970s and 1980s photographing the victims of mafia murders and the internal wars between rival clans. As a result she received several death threats. Born and raised in postwar Palermo, she had moved with her family to northern Italy and married at 16. But after divorcing and a three-year sojourn in Milan, she returned to Sicily with her longtime partner, Franco Zecchin, in 1974. Her ambition was to be a writer, but her journalistic career came to an end when she first picked up a camera at the age of 40. “I thought: ‘With this in my hand, I can take on the world,’” she once told the Guardian. During those years, a war between the mafia families in and around Palermo led to hundreds of deaths. The Corleone clan decided to conquer the city by killing its rivals, along with dozens of police officers, judges and politicians who were trying to stop that war. “They were terrible years,” Battaglia said in another interview in 2017. “You no longer knew who your friends or enemies were. In the morning, you came out of the house and did not know if you’d come back in the evening. The bosses could blow my head off, any second. “When the police stopped them, I approached them, as close as possible, to photograph them, in their handcuffs. I wanted the bosses to look me in my eyes, even at the cost of spitting on my face. That was also a way for me to challenge the mafia.” The 600,000 iconic images she took helped expose the brutal reality of the mafia and their victims in Sicily. “Suddenly, I had an archive of blood,” she once said. The shocking, transgressive images of bodies taken by Battaglia were featured in a 2019 documentary about her life titled Shooting the Mafia. Battaglia had been ill for some time and died late on Wednesday in the Sicilian capital, prompting an outpouring of tributes on social media. “Palermo has lost an extraordinary woman,” Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo and a friend of Battaglia, said. “Letizia Battaglia was an internationally recognised symbol in the art world. She was an extraordinary person who made visible what was invisible.”",News/World news,"Letizia Battaglia, photojournalist who documented mafia crimes, dies aged 87",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/letizia-battaglia-photojournalist-who-documented-mafia-crimes-dies-aged-87
4/14/2022,"The mayors of Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester have written to all 650 MPs in advance of the 33rd anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on Friday, urging them to support fundamental reforms of the legal system known as the “Hillsborough law”. Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham said in their letter that victims of other disasters suffer the same systemic failures that forced the bereaved Hillsborough families to fight a decades-long campaign against injustice. The Hillsborough law proposals principally are that all public officials, including police officers, should have a legal “duty of candour”; for bereaved families to have full funding for lawyers to represent them at inquests, and for public bodies to sign a charter committing them to fair conduct. The proposals, supported by families, were developed after the 2014‑16 second inquest into the deaths of 96 men, women and children at the FA Cup semi‑final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. However, the government has not passed any of the reforms into law. Theresa May’s government in 2017 did support one measure, a public advocate for bereaved families, championed by the Labour MP Maria Eagle, but did not introduce it. James Jones, the former bishop of Liverpool, made 25 recommendations that formed the basis for the Hillsborough law proposals, in a 2017 report commissioned by May, but the government has not yet responded to it. Rotheram and Burnham describe that as “disrespectful to the Hillsborough families”. The 2016 inquest jury found that the 96 people – now 97, since the death of Andrew Devine, 55, last July – were unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield. The jury also rejected years of allegations by South Yorkshire police officers that Liverpool supporters misbehaved at Hillsborough, and determined that no conduct of the supporters contributed to the disaster. Despite that verdict, nobody has been legally held to account for causing the 97 unlawful killings, nor for the discredited police case. Duckenfield was acquitted of a criminal charge of gross negligence manslaughter in 2019. Rotheram and Burnham wrote in their letter that injustice is also being suffered by victims of the British army’s 1950s nuclear tests, the contaminated blood scandals, the Grenfell fire and the Manchester Arena bombing. “The reason why this pattern keeps on repeating is simple,” their letter states. “The scales of justice are weighed against ordinary families and in favour of public authorities who hold all the power.” Saying “the need for a Hillsborough Law is clear”, they wrote: A fundamental re-balancing of the legal, coronial and judicial systems , creating a level playing field for bereaved families with agencies of the state, will prevent future generations experiencing the injustices we have seen in our lifetimes.” A Home Office spokesperson praised the Hillsborough families’ “tremendous courage”, and said: “The Home Office has been working closely with its partners in the relevant government departments and organisations to carefully consider the points of learning made by Bishop James Jones. Our focus now is engaging with the Hillsborough families and publishing the government’s overarching response to the bishop’s report in due course.”",Sport/Football,MPs urged on disaster anniversary to support ‘Hillsborough law’ reform,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/mps-urged-on-disaster-anniversary-to-support-hillsborough-law-reform
4/14/2022,"Despite being a Grade II listed building, Warmington House is nestled incongruously within the fabric of the sparkling new Tottenham Hotspur football club complex at White Hart Lane, north London. It’s like a visitor from another time, and its contents are equally evocative of a world and a set of experiences shared with previous generations. Inside is the OOF Gallery, a contemporary art space that currently contains a selection of the football photographs of Martin Parr. These pictures have a strange duality. Now 69, Parr has been taking photos for more than 50 years, and his recent battle with cancer has added an extra poignancy to these samples of his life’s work. Parr has traced British football’s journey through decrepitude, deindustrialisation and gentrification. These are definitively football photos but always portraits of grounds and supporters, never of the game itself. They’re cultural totems, snapshots of memory but also football as many of us still experience it. As Parr sees it, football fulfils an important function. “It’s a way of people accessing emotions. It’s very tribal … It’s an important aspect of creating your own identity. Especially for men; it’s a very welcome way of letting your emotions go.” His photos record moments of catharsis, but they’re also about belonging. One memorable image shows the seats at Wolverhampton Wanderers’ ground covered by striped Tesco bags. They had been left there by supporters of West Bromwich Albion (who are nicknamed the Baggies and play in striped shirts) as a cheeky way of claiming the territory. Football’s culture has always been acerbic and its humour self-generating. Parr captures these nuances brilliantly. Football – like many aspects of British urban life – used to be a spartan affair. Parr’s photograph taken at Bradford City in 1979 will spark a wince of recognition and a sigh of nostalgia in anyone old enough to remember the 1970s. It’s black and white. Weeds grow through the concrete terraces. The men (they’re all men, naturally) watch the game studiously standing as far apart as possible. It is a collective, public and yet intensely private experience. The photo is very slightly blurred: it’s a vision, a hallucination of industrial Britain captured just before obsolescence. These are fragments of the past, caught in transition. A shot of Portsmouth supporters on a visit to Bradford captures another transition. It is 1980 and one era is slowly giving way to another. “From a cultural point of view, you can see how the demographic of football supporters is starting to change,” says the gallery’s curator, Justin Hammond. “You’ve still got old skinheads with scarves tied round their wrists. You’ve got guys in donkey jackets, which were a symbol of the working man in the 70s. But you’ve got this bloke at the back in a duffel coat and Kickers. There’s a younger generation starting to infiltrate. It’s the dawn of the casual era. And then right at the front, there’s quite a glamorous-looking woman, in furs and high boots. In this era, when you see a woman there it really jumps out.” So what do the replica-shirted fans of 2022 make of this time capsule within their state-of-the-art temple to football? Hammond and co-curator Eddy Frankel see it as an opportunity to enablewant to establish a dialogue between two worlds. Both are Spurs season ticket holders and serious contemporary art curators. “Commercially, it would make total sense for us to display pop art prints of Harry Kane or whatever,” says Hammond, pointing to the gallery’s prodigious footfall on match days. “We’d make a killing. But we’d be really underselling the potential of this.” Martin Parr bridges the gap perfectly. “This is what’s amazing about having Martin,” says Frankel. “He’s a big name and really well respected as an artist. But on another level, his photos are easy to understand. People get it straight away … The vast majority of people who come in here will never have been to a contemporary art gallery. We’re indoctrinating people by stealth!” Halifax Town supporters, 1977“This is a good example of how a smaller crowd gives you an opportunity to arrange people within the frame in an interesting way,” says Parr. “You need that extra guy at the back to balance out the row of seven and make the picture work. That’s a bit of luck in a way. But luck is earned in photography. If you walk around for long enough, you’ll come across something that fits into place eventually.” Hartlepool United fans on the terraces, 1982“The kids on the ladder at the back probably got in for free. Again, these lower-league grounds are a lot more interesting: you don’t have to sneak a camera in; you can wander around the crowd and choose an angle; you can go anywhere. In the Premier League you’re stuck in one place. I like space but I also like crowds. So it’s a question of balancing those two things.” Portsmouth fans in Bradford, 1980“It’s the end of the match. If you’ve got quite a big crowd, you get these amazing fluid waves of people. This is a good example of that. If you can get a sense of height on the back of the crowd, it works particularly well.” Martin Parr and Corbin Shaw are showing at the OOF Gallery, Warmington House, London, to 8 May.",Arts/Art and design,‘It’s very tribal’: Martin Parr on capturing the real beautiful game,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/14/martin-parr-real-beautiful-game-oof-gallery-tottenham-hotspur
4/14/2022,"When the Times last put Rishi Sunak on the cover of its Saturday magazine, in August 2020, it used a picture that was almost normal. There stood the chancellor behind a green leather chair, wearing a navy suit and purple tie – but Photoshopped above his head was one extra detail: a gold halo, as if to say here is no mere finance minister, but an envoy from God.Back then, lots of people thought the chancellor was simply divine. This was the era of “dishy Rishi”, of pundits gurgling in delight over a professionally curated Instagram feed, of GQ magazine mooning over the 40-something as an “unlikely style hero”. “Are Sunak’s suits really all that good? Or am I being blindsided by those kind eyes and that flawless complexion?”, mused its style director, like a character from a Judy Blume novel. It might have been only two years back, but it feels like an eternity ago. Bad news now clings to Sunak like burrs to a dog after a walk in the woods. First, the resounding emptiness of last month’s spring statement, even as the country was sliding into a historic social and economic crisis. Then last week’s revelations that his wife doesn’t pay UK tax on her international income and that the chancellor himself held a US green card while living in Downing Street. And on Tuesday, the Metropolitan police slapped him with a fine for attending a birthday party for Boris Johnson. Sunak’s allies are telling journalists he is furious about the police decision, saying he only went to the cabinet room to see the prime minister about something else. This may be true. What is false is the chancellor’s claim that he broke no rules and that he “did not attend any parties”. Just like his boss, he has lied to both the public and parliament. It is now almost impossible to see Sunak as a serious contender for No 10, as he was just a few months ago. His abstemious diligence offered a contrast to Johnson’s exuberant shamelessness. He spoke fluent spreadsheet while doling out relatable content on social media. During the pandemic, he slogged away at his desk while his colleagues went paddleboarding or smooched in their ministerial offices. He was a technocrat in an age of populism, a grownup among a cabinet of sullen bumblers. He was a David Cameron protege who’d thrived in the Johnson era, going from rookie MP to second-top job in government in just five years. He was slick, sharp, seemingly centrist. He was, in short, the prime minister for those who claimed to be politically homeless. Or so went the pitch. I have never bought it. Throughout his time at No 11, Sunak has veered between myopia and cruelty. He was late to spot just how serious Covid would prove to be, delivering a budget in mid-March 2020 that had to be pulled apart and updated, week after week. His crowning achievement was to introduce the furlough scheme, which he wound up with such indecent haste that he was then forced to extend the scheme, at one point only five hours before it was due to expire. In organising the £46bn “bounce back loan scheme”, he has overseen the greatest amount of fraud of any chancellor – so bad that one of his own ministers, Lord Agnew, resigned in disgust. Considering the sums of public money involved, this scandal should be on every front page in Britain: tens of thousands of loans handed to potential fraudsters and an estimated figure of up to £20bn lost from the public purse. Perhaps £4bn of that will be written off as fraud – roughly as much as Sunak has chopped off this year’s foreign aid budget. The apparently non-ideological Conservative, as William Hague dubbed him, has allowed out-of-work benefits to fall this month to a 50-year low. The man who couldn’t sort out the sick pay system at a time when unprecedented numbers were falling sick, instead dreamed up Eat out to help out, which cost taxpayers £840m while also encouraging Covid to spread. According to the latest issue of the peer-reviewed Economic Journal, the scheme “can account for between 8% [and] 17% of all new [Covid-19] infections” during the period in which the scheme was active, (and likely many more non-detected asymptomatic infections). But it did yield a great photo op, in which everyone’s favourite ex-hedge funder put in a shift waiting tables at Wagamama. No Labour chancellor could have got away with wasting such vast sums. No politician should get off the hook for enacting policies that make people ill. And no prime ministerial would-be should be allowed to have no plans to deal with the soaring cost of fuel and goods. Those are the charges for which the chancellor should be arraigned, not chirruping Happy Birthday with Carrie Johnson. Yet, up until very recently, Sunak has enjoyed an amazing lack of scrutiny. He sits at the very centre of the curious nexus between the Spectator and Downing Street. He was best man at the wedding of the magazine’s political editor – the wife of whom went on to become Sunak’s spokeswoman. The newspapers treated this cosiness as mere happy coincidence. His background in shadow banking, his £10m portfolio of houses, his anti-lockdown politics: none of it raised so much as an eyebrow. He married into the family of one of the most important businessmen on the planet, Narayana Murty of Infosys, but the chancellor’s father-in-law has aroused barely any curiosity in the British press. Yet as the writer Emiliano Mellino points out in his latest Substack, the man who Sunak calls “wonderful” opposes the forming of trade unions in India’s IT industry and has called for workers to put in 60-hour weeks. Sunak was the Icarus of this parliament, the man who crashed to Earth but should never have been allowed to fly so high in the first place. And now the competition to replace Johnson will go on without him, its new frontrunners exposing just how strange and swivel-eyed today’s Conservative party really is. Liz Truss, anyone?

4/14/2022,"The car is hurtling toward Ukraine at 100 miles an hour, crammed beyond any reasonable capacity. Every space not occupied by bodies is filled by the sort of luggage you bring when you’ve volunteered for a last-ditch battle in a nuclear-age crusade: armor plates, iodine tablets, field dressings, satellite phones. Everything except guns. Those will be provided. My fellow riders – four Americans, three of them former military – are explaining why a person would drop everything and travel across the world to risk his life defending someone else’s country. “All of us have the same story,” Tay, an Afghanistan veteran, says. That’s not quite true, but his story might as well be the starting point. A month earlier he was home in Dallas, Texas, watching videos about the Russian invasion, when he saw the president of Ukraine addressing the world. “To all the friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, “come. We will give you weapons.” Tay served with the 82nd Airborne in Ghazni province, Afghanistan. He marched in front of armored vehicles, sweeping for mines, and guarded against enemy motorcyclists. His unit was under constant IED attack. After he began to have seizures, he was honorably discharged and labeled “disabled”, a classification he accepted out of economic necessity but resented. With prolonged treatment, the seizures mostly went away, but not before he went through a bad spell. His marriage ended; he got in fights and trouble with the law. He spent years pulling himself out of the hole. He “unchubbied” himself, after so much time spent fat and depressed. He found work as a private investigator and later in underwater construction, building docks for rich people. He had partly succeeded at his project of personal reconstruction when he started to see pictures of Ukrainian civilians making molotov cocktails, and bombed-out maternity hospitals, and Zelenskiy in his olive-green zip-up. That’s when he contacted his congressman’s office, which agreed to secure him an emergency passport after he found a Ukrainian NGO to vouch for him. He began packing, and bought a one-way flight. When he broke the decision to his friends and family, “the reaction was terrible”. They were distraught that he would walk away from his civilian life, from his nice high-rise apartment, to fight and possibly die for Ukraine. They did not understand, he says, that this was a way to be useful in the best way he knew how – that this was a chance to make himself right. After Russian-aligned forces marched into Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, foreign fighters began gravitating to Ukraine. Some fought for the Russian side. The war was narrower then, and got less global attention, so the volunteers were a small and self-selecting bunch who tended to be driven by ideological fervor and post-Soviet grievances. The volunteers included some extremists – neo-Nazis and alleged war criminals. One of Ukraine’s most effective fighting units, the Azov battalion, started as a far-right militia and is still believed to contain a number of extremists. The existence of the unit, which was folded into the Ukrainian military in late 2014, has featured heavily in Putin’s otherwise groundless claim that he is “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. Most of these earlier foreign fighters came from the countries of the former Soviet Union. For them, the battle over eastern Ukraine was the latest iteration of a longer war between Russia and its neighbors. Of that first batch of volunteers, “[f]ewer than 1,000 were from the west”, Kacper Rekawek, who studies foreign fighters, told Slate. When rockets began hitting Kyiv this February, the entire world was watching, and the stakes felt higher. Then Zelenskiy made his appeal, and Ukraine announced the formation of an international legion for foreign volunteers who wanted to join its defense. Barely a week after the invasion, the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC said that it had received 3,000 applications to fight. Groups quickly sprouted on Facebook and Reddit for the purpose of organizing. Some of the potential American volunteers were hopelessly naive. A lot seemed more interested in talking about going to Ukraine than actually going; conversely, some of those most keen to go lacked military experience or any useful skills such as medical training. The first group became known, disparagingly, as “Facebook warriors” and the second as “Call of Duty warriors”. The more serious volunteers funneled into smaller groups, using Signal, the encrypted app, to communicate, and tried to screen each other. Soon, I was in conversation with more than a dozen Americans who said they were either on the ground in Ukraine or heading there within the week; many had just bought flights and were in the final stages of getting their “affairs in order”, as one person put it. The overwhelming majority were male, though I talked to a female firefighter and EMT who said she was trying to find a financial sponsor to fund her way to Ukraine. She, like some others I spoke to, seemed to be taking significant financial risks to get over. Most people said that their loved ones were unhappy with their decision, but became supportive after it was apparent that they could not be dissuaded. Some were planning to go for two or three weeks, then return to their spouses, children, jobs and dogs in the US; others said that they were going for as long as it took. Most of the people asked to be identified by first names only, due to security concerns or because their friends and families aren’t aware of their decision. “It’s easy to romanticize a war,” or to view it as “one big adventure, as insane as that sounds”, one volunteer, Alex, admitted. When the Ukraine war started, his old army friends – many of whom were not necessarily combat veterans – started joking about going, then discussing it more seriously. When it came time to actually commit, everyone but him dropped out. Some of the volunteers said that they preferred non-combat roles, and hoped to be useful as medics, firefighters, or drivers. Many were at pains to emphasize that they’d do whatever was most useful to Ukraine, whether at the front or loading supply convoys in the rear. After I was contacted by someone flying out of New York, we agreed that I would shadow him to Warsaw, where he was meeting several others, then travel with them up to the Ukrainian border, after which they would send me updates as they made their way to the war. When he sits down next to me at the gate of our airport in New York, Scott is like caffeine in corporeal form. He’s just spent hours in an agitating but ultimately successful negotiation with customs officials. “I’m not going anywhere without my body armor,” Scott tells me. “I may be crazy, but I’m not stupid.” Scott is covered in tattoos. He wears glasses and is, at 49, older than I expected when I first started talking to him on Signal. He is garrulous, type A, and slightly intense, with bullet-train speech punctuated by Gen-X mannerisms such as “man” and “dude”. He’s keeping on his Covid mask, he mentions offhandedly, because he has stage-four leukemia. His treatment has been successful for some time, he says, and his diagnosis is not considered terminal. When I ask him if there is some relation between his cancer and his decision to join a war against Russian imperialism, he seems perplexed by my assumption. This, I will come to realize, is classic Scott. Later, he will casually mention that he only showers twice a month, not finding additional bathing necessary; when I don’t believe him, he puts his partner on speakerphone so she can confirm. (“For some reason he doesn’t really smell?” she says.) Scott is a recovering addict, many years sober. When he heard Zelenskiy’s appeal, he tells me, he had the same feeling he’d felt years earlier at one of his first AA meetings, when he was asked to stand and speak: I don’t want to do this, but I have to. Unlike the others in the group, Scott is not a vet, though he’s an outdoorsman with search-and-rescue experience and is hoping to help the war effort in a logistical capacity. Scott and his partner live in New England. They don’t have children and he currently doesn’t work. His partner, a marketing executive, encouraged his going to Ukraine, he says, in part because she knows that once he makes a decision there’s no point trying to stop him. As we file on to the plane, I notice that he’s flying business-class. “I don’t normally,” he says, “but she said, you know, if it might be my last …” Not many days before our flight, Russia bombed a Ukrainian military base where foreign fighters trained; 35 people died, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia claimed to have killed 180 “foreign mercenaries”, and issued a menacing statement vowing “no mercy for mercenaries wherever they are on the territory of Ukraine”. Scott explains that in the last 48 hours one of the volunteer groups organizing a pipeline to Ukraine completely collapsed. It’s been a mess, with in-fighting and schisms, and he is leery of aligning with possible “cowboys” now that a lot of people are about to show up in Poland unsure of where to go and whom to trust. Later, as we’re flying somewhere over Germany, Scott beckons me to his window. Through the clouds there are fighter jets on maneuver. He chuckles. “Does it feel real yet?” “What does this remind you of, this time in history?” a CNN reporter recently asked three volunteers on their way to Ukraine. “1936,” a young British man answered without hesitation. “When fascism rose in Spain.” He continued: “A lot of people went over, but not enough. If we’d crushed fascism in 1936, we could’ve averted 1939. That’s what this feels like. If we don’t stop it now, it’s gonna be our kids fighting this fight.” An estimated 2,800 volunteers left from the US to fight fascism in the Spanish civil war; accurate numbers are hard to come by, but about 800 are believed to have been killed. During the cold war, soldiers of fortune motivated by a mixture of money and ideology wandered between colonial dirty wars, battling communist insurgencies and, in some cases, propping up white minority regimes. More recently, western volunteers went to Syria to join the Kurds battling the Islamic State. Some also joined it. With Ukraine there is no “ideology or politics, just guys who wouldn’t wanna miss out on a just war”, a former US marine told the Military Times. He said he’d previously volunteered in Kurdish and Yazidi units fighting IS. Eager to internationalize its cause, Ukraine has welcomed volunteers, though it has tried to prioritize. “We should only take experienced combat veterans – that is the lesson that we are learning,” a Ukrainian general told the American military magazine Task & Purpose. “The others don’t know what they are getting themselves into – and when they find out, they want to go home.” Some experts have been skeptical about the practical utility of volunteers who can’t speak the local language, or have argued that foreign fighters may escalate the conflict or protract the war. “If I can help one Ukrainian, it’s worth it,” multiple American volunteers told me. A lot said they don’t really know what to expect, and have taken a get there first, figure out the details later approach. “I’ve been up since 4am,” Tay says, when he meets Scott and me at a hotel near the Warsaw airport, “babysitting people who don’t have their shit together.” His frustration is palpable but his demeanor is friendly, if faintly restless. Since arriving several days earlier, he has spent most of his time rescuing strays. One American was sleeping in a park after being kicked out of a hotel for fighting with security; two others, clearly out of their depth, have already decided to go home – decisions Tay has encouraged. Tay, 30, has “ex-soldier” etched all over him – somewhat literally, with small scars on the side of his face from an explosion in Afghanistan. He has first aid skills that could be useful in a humanitarian or combat medic role, he tells us, but fighting is what he really knows how to do, and he’s determined to go to the front. He’s single, though he recently bought life insurance with a special policy that he hopes will take care of his sisters if something happens to him in Ukraine. When we spoke on Signal before arriving, and I started to ask if he was really prepared to die for Ukraine, he cut me off. “With my shield, or on it,” he said. The volunteer pipelines, Tay has heard from other ex-soldiers arriving, are still in chaos. Part of the problem is that few Americans are willing to join the official Ukrainian Legion – they’re expected to sign a contract, which no one wants to do, and they’ve heard that your passport is taken to prevent you from leaving. Some of the militias are rumored to take an even less kindly view of short-termers. And “people are showing up with no plan”, he says. “There are a lot of guys coming out here amped up on Red Bull. The army babied us – or at least told us where to go and what to do. Here we have to do that for ourselves.” Rick arrives that afternoon, looking absolutely exhausted. He’s had a bit of an ordeal. First his flight was canceled, then his second one was grounded, and then, while connecting in Amsterdam, he had “just enjoyed a nice tuna sandwich when two humongous Dutchmen came up and asked if I could talk to them”. The police officers, or whoever they were, interrogated him for 40 minutes about his military gear and his intentions. He told them, honestly, that he was going to Ukraine to help in any way he could. Eventually they let him go. Rick, 30, is ex-army air assault. He has a beard and the requisite sleeves of tattoos. He joined the military at 17 – “I was a literal child” – and served three deployments in Afghanistan. He spent time at a tiny combat outpost in Gardez, fighting off Taliban attacks at 2am in his underwear. He’s open about his PTSD, and skeptical of combat vets who claim to be untroubled by it. Rick is less talkative than Scott and Tay, but has a penchant for dry wisecracks. (“I like you, Oliver,” he remarks later. “I’d take a bullet for you. Not, like, a large-caliber bullet. Maybe a .22.”) He is a firefighter and EMT in rural Texas, where he’s also qualified as a firearms instructor. Unlike the other two, Rick has a return flight; he’s planning to go to Ukraine for a week or so and hopefully help out as a medic or in training others. If he’s of use, he may come back. He decided to go, he says, after seeing pictures of wounded children. “I looked at my eight-year-old and thought, ‘If he was getting shelled, I would hope someone would try to help him.’” Rick doesn’t plan to get too close to the front, though he admits later that he wrote a sealed letter to his son in case he doesn’t return. Sitting in a hotel room, the group discusses the surreality of everything. When Rick bought his flight, his girlfriend asked if he was high on Ambien. “She told me not to go a thousand times,” he says. “Wait, what?” Scott says. “Mine told me to go.” “I told my son I’d bring him back a piece of Russian tank,” Rick says. “He plays Xbox with a kid in Ukraine, so he heard about the war almost before I did.” The group talks through a plan: set out early tomorrow morning for the Polish-Ukrainian border, and there catch a train to Lviv, where they will decide whether to stick together or go their own ways. Tay is more gung-ho than Scott and Rick, and I get the sense that makes them uneasy. At times, the group’s dynamics resemble the world’s oddest platonic group date. Periodically throughout the trip, one of the men will corner me privately and try to solicit my impression of one or another of the others. Everyone is adamant about not joining the Ukrainian Legion or any of the outfits that require signing a contract, and instead, if possible, working with other Americans in ad hoc groups – both prospects with individual as well as geopolitical risks. “There’s little doubt an American captive, particularly a veteran, would be a propaganda coup for the Kremlin,” Matt Gallagher, a veteran and novelist who recently returned from training civilian fighters in Ukraine, acknowledged in an op-ed in the New York Times. “There must now be thousands of Americans in the country, working in both military and humanitarian capacities. I fear it’s a matter of when, not if, one of them falls into Russian hands and becomes the main character in a cautionary tale.” Aren’t you worried, I ask, that if the Russians capture you without insignia they’ll declare you a mercenary or a spy, and shoot you on the spot? Tay, cleaning his fingernails with a bowie knife, disputes the premise of the question. “Russia has basically said that they’re gonna just fucking kill any foreign fighters,” even those who are part of the official Ukrainian army. “At the end of the day they can say whatever they want to say, since we’re not technically supposed to be there.” “So, guys,” Rick jokes, “do we want to visit Chernobyl?” “I guess I wouldn’t need chemo any more,” Scott says. The early-morning departure for the border is almost immediately derailed. Tay, who is staying at a different hotel, isn’t answering his phone. We drive there to try to find him. Scott is freaking out. “This is not the way I like to do things,” he keeps saying. He argues that if they can’t find Tay soon, they should leave without him. Rick is resistant. (He says later that he’s had a lot of friends, particularly veterans, who have died in suicides or accidents, “so it was more about just wanting to check that he was alright.”) He gets Tay’s room number from the hotel receptionist then pounds on the room until Tay, naked and hungover, peers around the door. He admits that he went on a bender the night before with another ex-soldier, and lost his phone. As Rick and Tay make their way out of the hotel, a pair of men covered in Iron Cross tattoos approach and ask if they’re headed to Ukraine. The men are Finnish and, it dawns on Rick and Tay, neo-Nazis. The Finns strike Tay, who is part Asian, as standoffish, though they loathe Russia and seem to accept him as having common cause. They’ve just returned from Ukraine, and give some practical advice on getting there; they even offer the use of their car. Tay and Rick politely decline. “Happy hunting,” one of the neo-Nazis says. “God, I wish I was white now I’ve met these motherfuckers,” Tay says, laughing nervously, as he and Rick squeeze into the overstuffed car. “Am I gonna be the only colored boy in this country?” The group is slightly unsettled by the neo-Nazi encounter – Rick initially asks me to treat the story as off-the-record, out of concern that it will taint the volunteer cause – but also seem to take it as inevitable that the war will draw some repugnant bedfellows. Scott is still furious about getting behind schedule. “I’m sorry, OK?” Tay says. “But I waited four days for you guys to arrive. You could wait half an hour for me.” We also pick up the final member of the group, who arrived late last night. Alex, 32, is a gigantic, kindly man, more black bear than grizzly. He spent four years in the army and a year in the national guard, but never deployed, a fact of which he seems slightly embarrassed. His family are worried about his coming, he says, but proud, and his employer actually contributed money for his body armor – “It’s kind of a Tennessee thing.” The car careens through the outskirts of Warsaw, then onto the highway. The traffic gets sparser as we go. We gun past military convoys and petrol trucks going the same direction. Tay works through a package of Polish chocolate wafers. He plans to fight in the war as long as it takes, he says, then make “a fresh start” in Ukraine or Romania, where he has friends. He doesn’t want to go back to the US. His home country, for him, is trouble – bad memories, money problems, strangers in bars who challenge you to fights. The cheap cost of living in eastern Europe means his military benefits will “actually do the work they’re supposed to”. By the end of the hours-long car ride, the earlier tensions in the group have mostly fallen away; a brotherhood has formed, at least for now. Rick later tells me: “Everyone in that car was thinking about if they’d die, and anyone who says otherwise is lying.” Przemyśl – a small, pretty medieval city about seven miles from the Ukrainian border – is swollen with people and cars. The train station is thronged with Ukrainian refugees, as well as aid workers, volunteers, journalists, cops, Jehovah’s Witnesses, evangelicals from Florida and conspicuously inconspicuous men in plainclothes who loiter near the station observing those coming and going. The overflowing station is a halfway house for the innocent people caught in Russia’s invasion. The women, children and elderly people here are not Ukrainians with jobs in Poland or relatives in Germany to take them in, but those who’ve spent most of their resources getting to the border and don’t necessarily have a final destination yet. There are also a number of families waiting for trains into Ukraine. These are Ukrainians who’ve had trouble getting visas, or need to go back for family members, or who got to Poland and found the cost of living too high. “The main thing was to get my child out,” a 46-year-old Ukrainian, Natalia, explained to Euronews. Ukrainians “are returning because they couldn’t find accommodation, they couldn’t find work – there wasn’t a possibility to live here”. At home in Ukraine, “at least we can live off of our own resources”. There is fear and misery on display at the train station, but also a striking outpouring of help. Aid workers hand out food and blankets. At this and other border crossings, Polish mothers have been leaving spare strollers, diapers and baby clothes for those arriving. There are also religious groups engaged in what seems to be a more exploitative mixture of helping and proselytizing. As Scott, Tay, Rick, and Alex stride through the station, three men in baseball caps and boots approach and introduce themselves. One is a middle-aged American; the other two are Canadians he met online. They’re taking the same train. “I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t come,” the American says. “I had to. I couldn’t sleep.” He says that the time between his decision and his arrival was barely 24 hours. He has seven children and a small business, and set aside money so his workers’ salaries will be paid for several months. The man seems to be vaguely conservative in his politics – he later, after asking if I write for a liberal newspaper, abruptly stops speaking to me – but the pro-Putin slant in some corners of the rightwing American media sphere clearly hasn’t affected his fiercely pro-Ukraine sympathies. As angry as he is at the Russians, he says, it angers him almost as much that so many able-bodied people in Europe have not volunteered to fight. Rick, a libertarian and a supporter of the second amendment, says later, of American conservative apologists for Russia: “I’d like for them to have the longest day in their life, then finally get home to their families, and an air raid siren goes off and they have to go hide in a parking garage – I implore them to do that and still say [Putin] has a fucking point, or that we need to stay out of it.” This is as far as I’m allowed to follow. The four men promise to send me dispatches as they head to Lviv and then toward the front. They seem calm. I urge them to stay safe. “Honestly, I feel normal,” Alex says. “I’ve already turned my business switch on,” Tay says. After crossing the border, the group tells me, the train is blacked out. It travels in darkness for hours, starting and stopping frequently, and it is nearly midnight when they reach Lviv. The train station there strikes them as foreboding; there are latrines overflowing with excrement. The city’s monuments and gargoyles are covered in protective wrap. There is a military curfew in effect, and the group makes haste to their hotels. In the light of day, Lviv feels more like a normal city – charming, dynamic and, to Americans, cheap. Alex messages me: “You would fit right in, because you’re from New York.” Shortly after, Russia bombs Lviv. No one in the city is killed, but the strikes are close enough that Rick can see the smoke. As Rick and the others walk the city, they pass people sitting on sidewalks with their possessions laid out, trying to sell enough to get out of Ukraine. They give money. The Ukrainians they meet seem grateful for their presence. “We did not meet a single person who was mean to us,” Alex tells me, “and that meant a lot.” Tay and Alex want to press on to Kyiv, closer to active combat zones; they acquire some extra armor plates. Scott and Rick decide to stay in Lviv for the time being. Scott volunteers at a depot that is a clearinghouse for humanitarian aid. Tons of medicine has been arriving from countries around the world, labeled in countless languages or not labeled at all, so he helps sort it. Rick finds work as a nurse at a military hospital. He’s also recruited to help teach weapons and first aid classes. His students are baristas, graphic designers, and software engineers; in an underground bunker, he drills them on loading and cleaning automatic rifles. They practice clearing rooms and stairwells, guns first. An interpreter who used to be a runway model in Milan translates. He teaches a 65-year-old woman, barely strong enough to pull back the charging handle, how to fire a Kalashnikov. He runs into other Americans who have shown up and been pressed into service. Some of their qualifications seem dubious. He hears of an ex-soldier who has been representing himself as a former sniper as well as an expert on Javelin missiles – a combination that Rick finds improbable. He gets the sense that some vets are exploiting the war as a chance to do things they never got to do when they were actually in the military. During an air raid alert, Rick and his students take refuge underground. As a way to distract from the air raid, he encourages the students to split into two groups, with one mimicking gunshot victims, squirming and screaming as much as possible. “By the end,” he brags, “they could put a tourniquet on in 20 seconds.” After a few days in Lviv, Tay and Alex head toward Kyiv. “My confidence is actually growing,” Alex tells me, en route. “I feel like I’m in the right place, like God has placed me here, and getting on the train east is, obviously, an exciting feeling for me because I was in the military and never got to experience combat first-hand. But at the same time, it’s purposeful, it’s a purposeful feeling that I have. I feel extraordinarily blessed that I can serve the people in this way.” In Lviv, Rick is working long hours teaching and helping at the hospital, though he has occasional opportunities to enjoy the city as a tourist. Alcohol is ostensibly banned, but one evening three of his interpreters take him to a speakeasy of sorts. Another evening he’s walking when an air raid siren sounds; a random Ukrainian family pulls him into their apartment. He ends up spending the night there, using Google Translate to help communicate and sleeping on the floor. The family’s apartment is too tiny even for a pet, so the daughter has a cat doll that some aid workers gave her. He’s humbled by the family’s kindness. “This is a little girl whose most prized possession is a fake cat,” he tells me. “Boots in Kyiv,” Tay tells me by text on his fourth day in Ukraine. He and Alex can hear occasional fighting in the distance and pass bloodied soldiers heading to hospitals. Alex finds work doing first aid training. Tay meets a unit of citizen-soldiers heading to the front, and the experience is unsettling. They are “heavily armed, severely undertrained”, he says. The language barrier is very real, as is the atmosphere of suspicion. He spends a lot of time trying to prove that he is who he says he is. Many of the American and foreign volunteers who have arrived haven’t experienced enemy contact yet; of those who have, some are so traumatized or disillusioned that they have decided to head home. An American veteran tells Vice News that he was exposed to more in his “first three days” in Ukraine than his whole tour in Afghanistan. “Even those with military experience, you’ve got to realize that there isn’t a war that has been fought like this in a long time,” another vet tells Vice. The US and Nato militaries are “spoiled. When it comes to fighting a war, they have air support, medivac, logistics, all kinds of different levels of intelligence, and support. Here in Ukraine, we had none of that.” Many volunteers seem anxious at the possibility that the Ukrainian military will use foreigners as cannon fodder, though others have gotten the opposite impression – that Ukraine likes the propaganda value of foreign volunteers but prefers to keep them in the rear, in logistical or civil defense roles. Scott thinks that Ukraine wants Ukrainians to be seen doing the fighting. He’s still in Lviv, but planning to join an ad hoc group in the east doing armed evacuations from Russian-held areas. Tay is determined to get to the front. After a few days of silence, I receive a short video from him. He’s got a scarf covering the bottom half of his face and it’s slightly hard to read his tone of voice. “I’ve linked up with that unit, so this might be one of the last ones I send you,” he says. “I’m the only American now. Alex is going to do something else. We’re heading to the front soon, and we’re going to take back some of the occupied cities, do a little cleaning … So.” He throws up two fingers in a V-sign, then the video ends.",News/World news,Among the Americans fighting in Ukraine: ‘I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t come’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/americans-fighting-in-ukraine
4/14/2022,"For Antonio Rüdiger, today is another day, the time to get back in the saddle, to build up towards Chelsea’s next big game – the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley on Sunday. There is no point in being sad any more. The steeliness of his professionalism will, as usual, kick in. But it is probably fair to describe Wednesday as a lost day for Rüdiger, when the pain and frustration of what had happened in Madrid on Tuesday night gnawed away, tormenting him. Few players take defeat as hard as Rüdiger and one of the most vivid snapshots of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final exit against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu came after the full-time whistle. As Real celebrated their 5-4 aggregate passage, despite a 3-2 defeat on the night, Rüdiger lay prone. The Real defender David Alaba helped him to his feet but Rüdiger appeared oblivious, locked instead in an internal argument, heavy on violent movements and exhortations to the sky. Then, he sank back down to the ground, head in hands, seemingly wanting to curl up into a ball. Rüdiger had been emotional throughout. Perhaps, with his future uncertain – out of contract in June and with no immediate prospect of an extension as Chelsea remain between owners – he sensed a kind of swan-song, the final stretch at a club where he is adored by the support. More likely, though, this was just Rüdiger, the heart-on-sleeve competitor. The central defender had scored for 2-0 on the night, powering home a 51st-minute header from Mason Mount’s corner and, in stoppage time at the end of the 90 minutes – the tie level at 4-4 – it was his header that teed up the substitute Christian Pulisic for a chance to win it, which he really should have taken. Rüdiger’s best defensive moment had come in the 68th minute when he stretched to intercept a Toni Kroos pass that was intended for Vinícius Júnior after N’Golo Kanté had given the ball away in central midfield. Rüdiger leapt to his feet and, eyes popping with fury, he made Kanté perfectly aware of how he felt. For Rüdiger, it is about standards and focus. Which is why he would have been so disappointed at himself for Real’s extra-time winner, headed in by Karim Benzema. When Vinícius crossed from the left, Rüdiger did not appear to notice Benzema dropping off, buying the crucial space and, when he turned round, it was too late. To compound Rüdiger’s agony and the impression of helplessness, he slipped as he did so. What was noticeable when Rüdiger faced the TV cameras after the match was his realism. Thomas Tuchel, the Chelsea manager, had lamented the “two crucial ball losses” before each of the Real goals. Kanté saw a pass upfield cut out before the first and Thiago Silva misplaced a ball towards Kanté on the second. But Tuchel also muttered darkly about the influence of the Bernabéu crowd on referees. Rüdiger looked solely at Chelsea’s shortcomings and they included his own. “Over the two legs, if you make the kind of mistakes like we did, you get punished,” he said. It is how Rüdiger has long operated. No excuses, only home truths. He analyses his own game first and he is not the sort of player to demand reassurances from his inner circle; yes men to tell him how wonderful he is. On the contrary. One of the biggest influences on his career is his half-brother and agent, Sahr Senesie, who played professionally himself. Senesie will tell him the unvarnished truth and Rüdiger will listen. Rüdiger will use the Madrid heartbreak as fuel and, like everybody at the club, he knows that the Palace tie has the potential to make or break the season. Chelsea are geared to reach finals, to win trophies, and the FA Cup is all they have left. They have to build on the many positives of the performance at the Bernabéu. Rüdiger has gone from outcast under Frank Lampard to talismanic mainstay under Tuchel but, as things stand, he is more likely to leave the club in the summer than stay. Then again, what better opening move could the new owners make than to secure him to a new contract? The clock is ticking loudly. Rüdiger’s eyes are on Palace.",Sport/Football,Antonio Rüdiger will use Madrid heartbreak as fuel for next big match | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/antonio-rudiger-will-use-madrid-heartbreak-as-fuel-for-next-big-match
4/14/2022,"There is an image in the lobby of the striking Stormen library, perched on the edge of the harbour in cosmopolitan Bodø, that speaks to the Norwegian city’s past. An old family photograph shows an elderly couple from Nordland but what is not instantly recognisable is that the man’s Sami footwear, traditionally made from reindeer hide to cope with subzero temperatures, has been purposefully scribbled over and hidden. Bodø is the northernmost city in the world – it is 200km north of the Arctic Circle and among the best spots to spy the aurora borealis – and while skrei cod fishing represents the historical currency in the area, it now has a modest football club turning heads on the European stage on the equivalent of a healthy League One budget. Bodø/Glimt are riding the crest of a wave and visit Roma on Thursday hoping to advance to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League after a 2-1 first-leg victory in a spiky contest on their artificial pitch. Uefa is investigating clashes between coaching staff long after the final whistle, which could result in the Bodø head coach, Kjetil Knutsen, and the Roma goalkeeper coach, Nuno Santos, being suspended for the return but that humbling was another remarkable chapter in an extraordinary story. Bodø are hunting a hat-trick of victories against Roma this season, having trounced them 6-1 earlier in the competition, the heaviest defeat of José Mourinho’s career. Bodø were prevented from playing in Norway’s leading domestic division until 1972, with north Norwegians more than geographically isolated from society (the nearest major city, Tampere, in Finland, is a 15-hour drive); north Norwegians struggled to book hotels in the south. Bodø won the Norwegian Cup three years later – members of that side meet for coffee most mornings – and are entwined with the area. These days Bodø supporters carry giant yellow toothbrushes to games as a riposte to jibes from southern Norwegians about their teeth. “The only thing I could really compare it to on a European level is maybe some of the beliefs in the Basque region or Catalonia in Spain,” says Gregg Broughton, Bodø’s academy director who sits on the club’s management committee. “We have to remember that and embrace that. We have to be really, really brave, on the front foot and proud of being from the north of Norway.” The team once spent a week of their summer on the picturesque Lofoten Islands, where locals recently partied to celebrate the end of the cod fishing season, playing a couple of training games to further immerse the club in its community. “Living here in the north of Norway was very, very hard and unless you worked hard you wouldn’t have survived here previously,” Broughton says. “It is one of the roughest seas in the world so if you didn’t get your timing right and didn’t grab that moment, your life was at risk, but if you did your family is going to be able to live for the rest of the year. We have to have that in our DNA. The cod exports work their way down the west coast to Bergen, the big commerce town where fish is sent across Europe. Salmon farming is now also very big in northern Norway.” Bodø have won the league for the past two seasons and will partake in the Champions League first qualifying round in July. This calendar year started with victory at Celtic in February and next week they could secure a place in the Norwegian Cup final. Bodø’s most recent accounts detail a record turnover of €18m, aided by television revenue and player sales; Roma’s is about 10 times that. Bodø have seamlessly replaced key cogs. The prolific forwards Philip Zinckernagel, Kasper Junker and Erik Botheim have departed in the past 18 months, Zinckernagel for Watford, and Ola Solbakken, who made his Norway debut in November, could be next. The academy graduate Mathias Normann, now on loan at Norwich, was their first notable sale, to Brighton in 2017, and Patrick Berg, whose father, grandfather and uncles played for Bodø, and Jens Petter Hauge have since moved to Lens and Milan respectively. Bodø’s wage bill is €5m and their highest earners take home about the same as counterparts at Wigan Athletic or Wycombe Wanderers, in England’s third tier. “The funny thing in Norway is that everyone’s tax records get published annually so you can see what anybody earns so there is no point trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes in the dressing room,” Broughton says. “The budget is tiny, tiny, tiny and that is what makes the achievement so huge. You’re certainly not going to come here for the money, you’re certainly not going to come here for the weather but you are going to come here if you’re serious about career development.” Far bigger fish than Bodø could learn a thing or two about their holistic approach. They do not flip-flop in the face of adversity – they bounced back from relegation as recently as five years ago – and are focused on performance, with the mental coach, Bjørn Mannsverk, an ex-fighter jet pilot who served in Afghanistan and Libya, a key voice for players and staff. “He said to the management team: ‘By the way, you might not get the answers you want.’ They said: ‘Well, what do you mean?’ He said: ‘If I get the player group to open up to me, it might be they say: ‘We need to change head coach or I don’t want to be a footballer any more. Are you prepared for those answers?’ That was probably a ‘wow’ moment for us.” Broughton, who completed his Uefa pro licence alongside Graham Potter and Nemanja Matic, is among the English staff at the club, which includes the head of medical, Mike Brown, and three physiotherapists. Tom Dent, who began as Under-16s coach, left last year and is now assistant at Hamarkameratene, and Dan Leivers, a youth coach, recently departed to become academy manager at Notts County. For Broughton, who joined Bodø in 2017 and previously coached Ben Chilwell at Rushden & Diamonds, James Justin at Luton Town and Max Aarons, Ben Godfrey and Jamal Lewis at Norwich City, it has been a rewarding experience. “When an agent mentioned to me that they were looking for an academy director, although I had travelled extensively in Scandinavia, I wasn’t sure where Bodø was so I looked at a map and was like: ‘OK, that is quite far north.’ The scenery is absolutely beautiful. Within five minutes you can be in the wilderness. It is the only football club I know where you can walk to the airport.” Bodø is a European City of Culture for 2024 and the club is planning to build an all-wood stadium to mark the occasion. The club’s finest hour was that trouncing of Roma in October but they may yet trump that on Thursday. “Mourinho had never lost 6-1 in his career,” Broughton says. “He is the best-organised coach in world football … to catch him unprepared was amazing. It goes back to the skrei fishing; when you have the moment, you have to grab it.”",Sport/Football,"Bodø/Glimt, the Norweigan minnows catching Europe’s elite cold | Ben Fisher",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/bodglimt-the-norweigan-minnows-catching-europes-elite-cold
4/14/2022,"The camera pans across the facade of Parliament House, an Australian flag audibly flapping in the night-time breeze. Then we spy, through a window, the prime minister diligently working away beneath a photo of Queen Elizabeth II. Then we’re behind Scott Morrison, somewhere in the vicinity of his left ear, as we hear his voiceover, deep and earnest. “Things are tough,” he says. Political marketing lecturer Dr Andrew Hughes, from the Australian National University, calls this “stalkercam”. We’ve somehow stumbled on the PM working hard to save the nation. “It’s like we’re looking through his window, late at night, and he’s working on documents, being ‘prime ministery’,” Hughes says of Morrison’s campaign video, released the night before the PM called the 2022 election. Why I love Australia pic.twitter.com/acmDsLgYo4 “It’s very doco style … as though we’ve caught him off guard.” Then we’re inside the office and the PM is raising the alarm with someone offscreen (Drought! Fire! Floods! Pandemic! War!). “The first time, I stopped watching after about 25 seconds, because I didn’t like the ‘dog ate my homework’ excuse,” says Dr Chris Wallace, author of How to Win an Election. “Droughts, fires, floods, pandemics. It’s coming out in the polling that people think he’s just an ordinary guy doing his job in hard times,” she says. “But he hasn’t done a good enough job.” Next in the social media ad, we’re the stalkers again as he talks into a phone, looking out a window, and the camera lingers rather obviously on his simple gold wedding band. Then Morrison asks himself: “What’s firing me up?” (He answers himself, with emotion: Year 11 and 12 trade students want to start their own businesses. “How good’s that?”). “Middle Australia,” Hughes says. “Blokes,” Wallace says. Wallace is also an associate professor at the 50/50 Foundation in the business, government and law faculty at the University of Canberra. “He’s lost the treble and upped the bass [in his voice]. He’s trying to win this election on the bloke vote and the crude metric he’s trying to project is the deeper your voice, the more blokey you are,” she says. “He’s hitting a number of basic buttons,” Wallace says. “The wedding ring was one of a number of crude buttons he was pressing – the ‘I’m married’ button.” The picture of the Queen? “The monarchist traditional values button.” The trade school talk? “It’s Morrison talking to his own people. He seems to think he can win this election on the bloke vote. News flash: half the population are women. He’s expecting those blokes who share his values to bring their women and children with him.” (Wallace also points out that “of course” young people studying trades will want to start their own businesses – they’ll mostly become subcontractors.) Hughes says Morrison is “trying to get trust back”. “He knows he’s lost it.” “That’s probably why he had the wedding ring as well – I’m a married man, a man you can trust.” The wedding band won’t, at least not for everyone, Hughes says. “The divorce rate is so high, and has been for such a long time,” he says. “[Outside the ad] he’s using [wife] Jenny as well.” But, Hughes adds, the ad might work for some. “If you’ve got a mortgage, a secure job, you’re probably wondering what all the fuss is about. Some people have done very well for themselves. “Not just rich people, people in the middle. Property values have gone up. A lot of people have much more money now than they ever dreamed of because of the LNP.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It may talk to those people, Hughes says, but that means it leaves out those who don’t have a home. Wallace says it’s a “classic vote consolidation ad”. “It’s him trying to double down and lock up his own people,” she says. “He’s projecting traditional values and hoping that’s enough.” Herald Sun columnist Peta Credlin (former chief of staff to former PM Tony Abbott) declared it “hits the mark” because it reminds people of everything you’ve done without telling them to be grateful for it. “It’s known as a memory ad,” she wrote.
