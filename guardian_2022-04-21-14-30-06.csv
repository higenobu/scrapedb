Or is it “no more fear”? “The sky is clear and grey …” or maybe “great”. “I’m gonna put my faith in a party true.” It might be “a party of two”. United Australia party’s election campaign advertisement Fighting for you: It’s time to Save Australia has racked up more than 15.5m views on YouTube. It’s not just the odd capitalisation that renders the two-minute video Trumpian. It’s the way it scans the crowds, with their “Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!” posters. The way the UAP’s founder, Clive Palmer, and its leader, Craig Kelly, are pictured being adored by fans, as they pitch themselves as anti-politicians. “From the Muzak-y song, Clive has probably avoided copyright breach litigation this time, unless there’s an elevator that wants to sue him,” says Dr Chris Wallace, the author of How to Win an Election. Last year the federal court ordered the mining tycoon to pay $1.5m for his unauthorised use of Twisted Sister’s We’re Not Gonna Take It with different lyrics in campaign ads. Palmer appealed the court’s decision. This year he’s gone with something more original. Well, apart from the Donald Trump-inspired imagery. Palmer, who’s running in the Senate and whose party is running candidates in all the lower seats, says he’s spending about $70m this election. There are unmissable billboards, TV commercials, the YouTube videos and full-page newspaper advertisements. It’s a sloshing sea of yellow. “Why has the UAP chosen yellow as its keynote colour?” Wallace asks. “Ninety-nine point nine per cent of the people in the ad are white. Maybe they’re aligning themselves with the gilets jaunes, she suggests, citing the French anti-government movement that began as a protest against fuel taxes. It’s not the first time Palmer’s party – now only represented in parliament by the former Liberal MP Kelly – has splashed election cash. In 2019 Palmer spent $60m but failed to win a spot. That’s far more than the major parties spent. While he didn’t have a seat to show for it, Labor’s review of its own surprise loss found Palmer was at least partly to blame. This time around Palmer says (perhaps not entirely seriously) he’ll preference the Greens before the major parties. But it’s still hard to know what effect the saturation of yellow ads will have this time around. Dr Andrew Hughes, a political marketing lecturer from the Australian National University, says this ad is “trying to tap into what Scott Morrison calls the silent majority, the quiet Australians”. The jingle is annoying for parents to listen to but easy for kids to remember, he says. “It’s very simple, very basic … the beat is slow enough for you to keep up with. “There’s the jingle, the T-shirts, the signs, the crowd. There’s a scene where the camera lingers on an older woman walking up the street … holding a sign [saying, tongue in cheek, she’s ‘dangerous’]. That’s what he’s trying to say – I now represent those [quiet Australians].” Hughes says Palmer’s advertising is taking oxygen from Labor and the Greens. People have a limited attention span; social media has limited space for ads. And Palmer fills them. He says the 15.5m-plus viewer figures should be taken with a grain of salt, because there might be bots or overseas viewers inflating them, but they still make the UAP look, to believers, like a major force. The party has come under fire for its messaging on the pandemic, and its latest ad splurge promises to keep interest rates at an unrealistically low 3%. But it’s possible none of that matters when it comes to what people take away from the ad, and what they do at the ballot box. Voters can operate on gut feel and name recognition. “We’re tuned out,” Hughes says. “We don’t care what they say. It’s the memory effect of the music and not necessarily the the ad itself.”",News/Australia news,Elevator rock and a sloshing sea of yellow: Clive Palmer’s Trumpian election campaign ad,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/elevator-rock-and-a-sloshing-sea-of-yellow-clive-palmers-trumpian-election-campaign-ad
4/21/2022,"After years of exponential growth, Netflix reported on Tuesday that it had lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade. The announcement spooked Wall Street and sent shares plummeting more than 35%, erasing more than $50bn in market capitalization from a company whose stock was already down more than 40% on the year. To explain the downturn, Netflix posited everything from the war in Ukraine to people sharing passwords. But what if the reason is much simpler – that Netflix just isn’t really making much people want to see any more? It’s been a long time since Netflix was the total package: the home of cherished sitcoms like The Office, buzzy dramas like House of Cards, the exclusive venue for cinematic events like Bird Box and all for less than 10 bucks a month. Now, as the streaming service’s value nosedives, the big question is: are you still watching? And if so, what exactly? I’m certainly finding it harder to answer that question. The other night, while spending 10 minutes scrolling around for a show to help me to sleep – Ozark (oof), the Ultimatum (hard pass), Serial Killer with Piers Morgan (yikes!) – I felt like a 90s cable TV viewer, aimlessly flipping around for something, anything, to watch. Since NBC took back The Office and HBO Max did the same with Friends, well, it can’t exactly be said that the emperor has no content. It’s just that Netflix’s whole approach favors quantity over quality. Critical hits like The Crown, Black Mirror and Russian Doll all began a while ago and new seasons can’t capture the watercooler excitement of earlier episodes. Netflix’s attempts at reclaiming the buzz have been patchy: Space Force promised big stars (Steve Carrell, John Malkovich) sending up a risible Trump-era program, but it fizzled in the end. Sex/Life is softcore porn with not much storyline, an eight-hour Red Shoe Diaries episode. Bridgerton, for all its creative remixing, is still working from a stale archetype, the period drama. Netflix’s films, too, are barely worth recommending. Netflix’s Oscar-nominated, star-studded centerpiece Don’t Look Up, equally heavy handed in its environmentalism and Adam McKay directorial tics, is a hard sell. Even when the company has tried to play it safe with huge name talent poached from other networks, Netflix hasn’t necessarily stoked fears of missing out. Dave Chappelle, Netflix’s $60m man, caused the streamer more trouble than he was worth with a 2021 comedy special that gaslit the trans community. Meanwhile, all expensive supposed streaming-record-breakers like the 2017 Will Smith sci-fi drama Bright (which cost a reported $90m) or the overhyped dramas spun out of Ryan Murphy’s $300million deal prove is that subscribers will watch anything with a big star attached simply because it’s available on Netflix; never mind if they’re any good. Netflix isn’t just a media company. It’s right up there with electricity and the telephone on the list of inventions that changed humanity, a cure for boredom and laziness. When going to the video rental store became too tedious, it delivered DVDs straight to our mailboxes. When the mailbox became too much of a schlep, it delivered the same content right to our televisions and laptops. It didn’t just make favorite movies and TV reruns available to us at all hours while making high caliber original programs. It did all of this consistently enough for us to ditch terrestrial television in droves. But ever since Netflix changed home entertainment for ever, rival media companies have raced to develop their own streaming apps, many of them debatably a better value than Netflix. HBO Max not only has exquisitely crafted TV (Euphoria, Last Week Tonight) and the entire Warner Bros library at its disposal; it has The Batman and other blockbuster films six weeks after their theatrical releases. Disney+ doggedly repurposes the Star Wars and Marvel universes, the kind of IP Netflix could only dream of. Paramount+ includes the NFL, March Madness and the Champions League. Prime Video comes free with signups for continued expedited shipping. With every new studio subscription app, Netflix becomes more of a victim of its own success. It took many fits and starts and starts before Netflix finally earned its first major award for original programming, the pilot episode of House of Cards taking home a 2013 Emmy for outstanding directing. Apple TV+ has been a thing for barely five minutes, and yet Ted Lasso and Coda cleaned up this awards season. Overall, Apple seems to have the whole Netflix ratio flipped, doing more with less. This isn’t to say that the competition has completely overtaken Netflix. As someone who was once unashamed to buy DVDs from subway platform vendors, I love that Netflix scoops up Nollywood bangers like How to Ruin Christmas and that they’ve revived One on One, Half & Half and other treasured Black sitcoms of my teenhood. Even some of the original programming deserves props. The Upshaws is a laugh-out-loud sitcom that could do with more critical attention. Netflix is also riding a bit of a hot streak in the reality TV department with Love Is Blind, Is It Cake? and other variations on the genre. Formula 1: Drive to Survive belongs in Netflix’s win column, too; the sport owes much of its resurgent popularity to the behind-the-scenes series. And yet Netflix still has nothing on Bravo, VH1, Lifetime and other cable stalwarts in the drinks-throwing, wig-snatching department. Beyond a handful of titles, there isn’t much keeping viewers tuned into Netflix besides habit – which is pretty much where many of them were with cable before the cut the cord and downloaded the app. Netflix used to be cool, a true disrupter. But success has made it fat and dull, with an outsized appetite for increasingly low-calorie content. It’s become the very thing it once disdained – just another expensive TV package. That’s not to say people won’t be watching. But surely more must be thinking about it.",News/Media,No wonder Netflix is bleeding subscribers – it’s become the new cable,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/no-wonder-netflix-is-bleeding-subscribers-its-become-the-new-cable
4/21/2022,"Joe Biden must act to reduce mounting economic pressure by ditching “woke advisers”, Mitt Romney said. The Utah senator and former Republican presidential nominee made the demand in a column for the Wall Street Journal. “A new set of priorities requires a new set of principals,” Romney wrote. “President Biden needs to ditch his woke advisers and surround himself with people who want to get the economy working again.” Romney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what a “woke adviser” was or who might qualify for the title. The White House did not comment. As midterm elections approach, the Biden administration faces strong economic headwinds. Inflation is at long-term highs, adding to a cost-of-living crisis fueled by the coronavirus pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Biden’s favourability rating has plummeted as polling shows disapproval of his handling of economic affairs. As the Associated Press put it, “hopes for a lasting economic renaissance have faded as Americans cope with higher food and energy costs. And the promise of a country no longer under the pandemic’s sway has been supplanted by the uncertainty of war in Europe.” Romney is a rare Republican not under Donald Trump’s sway, having been the only GOP senator to vote to convict Trump in both his impeachment trials. Romney has also plotted a middle course on some political issues. Earlier this month, he was one of three Republicans to vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman on the supreme court. Biden compared Romney to his father, the Michigan governor George Romney, who also “stood up and made these decisions on civil rights”. But in the Journal, Romney came out swinging. He wrote: “The Biden administration did pretty much everything wrong, injecting $1.9tn into a supply constrained economy, sending out stay-at-home checks, letting tenants live rent-free, squeezing oil and gas production, launching an avalanche of growth-killing regulations, lining up behind unions, and pushing yet another deficit-financed budget.” Biden “must stop nominating doves to the Fed”, Romney said, demanding “hard-nosed economists” instead. He also demanded Biden drop his Build Back Better spending plan, which aims among other goals to boost social care and combat the climate crisis. Romney repeated Republican calls for increased domestic oil and gas drilling but also indicated splits in his own party. The senator called for reform of programmes such as social security and Medicare rather than their end, as outlined in a controversial proposal by Rick Scott of Florida. Romney also said Biden should “find a way to stop the flood of illegal immigration while accelerating legal immigration”, a less hawkish stance than most in his party. His call to ditch “woke advisers” came alongside advice ahead of midterms in which Republicans are favoured to retake Congress. “Remember Bill Clinton’s 1992 mantra,” Romney wrote. “It’s the economy.” In fact, the phrase associated with Clinton’s victory over George HW Bush, coined by the adviser James Carville, was: “The economy, stupid.”",News/US news,"Joe Biden must ditch ‘woke advisers’ to fix US economy, Mitt Romney says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/joe-biden-woke-advisers-us-economy-mitt-romney-wall-street-journal
4/21/2022,"Oleg Zagorodnii is sitting in the cafe he owns in Kyiv, beneath a brightly coloured painting of Aladdin smiling down from the wall behind. “It is just me now, no baristas,” says the Ukrainian actor via video call. “People come. I make them coffee, give them dessert. They are happy to feel some kind of normal life. They sit in the cafe, we play music, we speak. Of course, all we talk about is war.” Zagorodnii has twice attempted to enlist in the army, only to be told that there are currently more volunteers than equipment. The best he can do is make appeals on social media for bulletproof vests, and use the cafe as a place to pass on food, supplies and military uniforms. “I try to do what I can in this terrible time,” he says. It was only a year ago that the 34-year-old rented a small cinema in the city to screen the cold war love story Firebird for his family and friends. In this stirring British-Estonian production, Zagorodnii, who has the looks of a 1940s matinee idol, stars as Roman, a soon-to-be-married fighter pilot who falls for a young conscript, Sergey, played by Britain’s Tom Prior, after they meet at a military base in Soviet-occupied 1970s Estonia. Based on the autobiography of the late Sergey Fetisov, Firebird might resemble any tale of forbidden desire – except that Sergey and Roman face more than simply scandal should their relationship be discovered. The Soviet-era setting lends the film a distinctive thriller element: think of it as The Love Lives of Others. When Zagorodnii landed the part, it was on the condition that he could master English in the three months before shooting began. “I knew only, ‘Hello, I am Oleg from Ukraine, my English very bad,’” recalls the actor. He also had to do five days of shooting practice. “So now, if someone gives me a gun, I know what to do with it.” The war is never far from our conversation. “My agent found me the job on Firebird,” he continues. “But now I want to shame him because he supports this Russian aggression. He wrote to me, ‘Oleg, keep it easy, we will make you free from Zelenskiy and then we will live in a normal friendly country.’ He thinks America is doing all this! That is when we stop our discussion.” Despite the initial language barrier between the two leads, the Estonian director Peeter Rebane knew Zagorodnii would be perfect as Roman. “It wasn’t just Oleg’s look but the way he held himself,” he says. “Tom is sensitive, artistic. Oleg has this matter-of-fact fighter-pilot quality. In hindsight, it helped that they were forced to communicate through looks and gestures at first, because that’s how it would have been between Sergey and Roman.” Rebane first encountered Fetisov’s book a decade ago. “I was amazed,” says the 48-year-old film-maker. “Being gay was a criminal offence. After it was decriminalised with the fall of the Soviet Union, it was still seen as abnormal.” Rebane knew he was gay at the age of nine. “But even by the time I came out to my mother in my early 20s, her first reaction was still, ‘It’s OK, we can get help.’” The knowledge that Sergey and Roman were falling in love in the very place where he grew up has given him, he says, a new perspective on LGBT people in his home country. “I could never have imagined that this kind of love story was happening there at that time. As small kids in occupied Estonia, my best friend and I would cycle near that same base. MiGs would fly overhead and we’d literally fall off our bikes.” That memory calls to mind one of the film’s more irreverent moments: a cut from Sergey and Roman in the throes of passion to a pair of fighter jets whooshing overhead, which puts a knowing spin on the old, sexually suggestive image of a train thundering into a tunnel. “We had more discussions over that than anything,” laughs Rebane. “A German critic who saw an early version told us, ‘I love the film but this shot kills it.’ But I wanted Firebird to seem as though it was made in the 1970s rather than now.” When he cast Prior, who played Stephen Hawking’s teenage son in The Theory of Everything, he got more than just a leading man. The actor suggested changes to the script, which led to him co-writing with Rebane a series of new drafts. These foregrounded the oppressive, paranoid conditions under which Sergey and Roman were forced to live. As they tried to raise funding to make the film, Prior also became co-producer and music supervisor, later having a hand in the editing. The pair subsequently established a distribution company to release Firebird in the UK. If the actor doesn’t show up at screenings to personally glad-hand each cinemagoer, it will be a shock. For all his multitasking, Prior’s passion for Firebird ultimately comes back to the role of Sergey. “It resonated instantly with me,” says the 31-year-old. “He has this radical quality of following his heart at all costs. We chose very consciously not to show him full of self-doubt and shame, qualities often associated with this kind of story. That’s something I also embrace. I’m not very good at lying to myself.” He and Rebane travelled to Moscow in 2016 to meet Fetisov, finding his company every bit as joyful as his prose. “Some of the people who were closest to him didn’t know his story,” says Prior. “He certainly wasn’t ashamed of who he was. He openly flirted with a male waiter when we were in a restaurant in Moscow. Any suffering he experienced was not in relation to his identity.” Fetisov’s death in 2017 at the age of 64 only hardened their resolve to tell his story. “We had made a promise to him,” says Rebane. Fetisov’s only stipulation, recalls Prior, was that “the film should be about love, not politics. Of course, it’s going to be received in a more political way now. But we wanted to make a universal story about what it means to go after love at any cost.” Remarkably for a film with such overtly gay content, several exterior scenes were filmed in Moscow. “An amazing local production company paid the right people and somehow made that happen,” says Prior. “We still don’t fully understand.” Even more surprising was the picture’s acceptance last year by the city’s film festival, though only the first of its scheduled screenings went ahead. “After that,” adds Prior, “there was a complaint about it being ‘homosexual propaganda’. We had 93 press articles written about it, all but one of which were negative. One headline translated as, ‘An Estonian, a Brit and a Ukrainian shame Moscow.’ Another called the film ‘a punch in the face of the Russian soldier’. It wasn’t technically banned but all tickets were cancelled. The film played to an empty auditorium.” An unexpected consequence of the invasion of Ukraine is that some countries have expressed a reluctance to release Firebird now that the appetite for Russian stories is negligible. Prior is justifiably flabbergasted at this. “Russia silenced this film,” he says. “They don’t want it shown. So to not screen it is kind of doing what Putin wants.” Getting the message out is currently his priority, though he concedes it won’t be easy. “Someone online said, ‘Why would you go and watch a Russian movie right now?’” Throughout our conversation, Prior has been eloquent and articulate. Only now do words fail him. “It’s like… arrrgghh!” For Zagorodnii, the invasion has made talking about Firebird bittersweet. “It is like it’s from another world, you know? Sergey and Roman are ready to die for their love. And in Ukraine, we are ready to die for our freedom, our land, our people. Before war, I built plans for my future. Now I understand my dreams have died because I must stay here and be with my people. I don’t know anything now about the future. I understand only that every day is more death, more destruction. Before this, we were independent. We didn’t need help. We needed only one thing: don’t touch us. I can’t understand why Russia did this.” He rubs his face, suddenly exhausted. I mumble something hopelessly inadequate about the world supporting Ukraine. “We feel your support,” he says sadly. “But how can this happen?”  Firebird is in cinemas from 22 April",Arts/Film,"The film Putin doesn’t want the world to see: Firebird, a gay love story about fighter pilots",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/film-putin-firebird-gay-love-story-fighter-pilots-dogfights-desire-moscow-russian
4/21/2022,"It was halfway through a show in Shrewsbury when Nish Kumar noticed an audience member being disruptive. It became so bad that he asked the man to leave, and on his way out the man turned to the comedian. “He shouted: ‘To be completely honest with you, my friend bought these tickets, and I thought I had tickets to see Romesh [Ranganathan],” Kumar said. He responded by explaining to the audience why the comment could be construed as racist and moved on. Confrontational behaviour at club gigs – where audiences have not paid to see a specific act and may not be familiar with the material – is one thing but the heckling that Kumar got was at a tour gig, where for the most part audiences know what they’re getting. “It was a real shock to the system,” Kumar said. The next night in Cheltenham, after he had posted about the incident on Instagram, someone called out “where’s Romesh?”. Again, he explained why that wasn’t funny, and then another audience member told him to “stop being so sensitive”. When he addressed her she doubled down, and she later wrote a letter of complaint to Kumar’s agent. “There’s something in the water,” said Kumar, who has noticed a change in audience behaviour since the pandemic. “I’ve had a few conversations with other comics and there’s a sense that something doesn’t quite feel right.” Comedians are not alone in noticing a shift in behaviour since the end of lockdown. There have been reports from supermarket workers and bus drivers of worsening treatment by customers, and concerns from child psychologists about a lack of empathy in children. Writing in the Guardian, the comedian Dani Johns says that since the lockdown restrictions lifted and live audiences returned to clubs, there has been an uptick in the amount of abuse and harassment she has received. Johns writes that “a small but noticeable percentage of audience members have forgotten how to behave in public … things have escalated since the pandemic – from aggressive heckling, to talking over the act, to jumping on stage.” In January a woman has been thrown out of Ranganathan’s gig at London’s Hammersmith Apollo after reportedly racially abusing the comedian. In October 2021 the comedian Rosie Jones, who has cerebral palsy, was targeted online by trolls who sent abusive messages after she appeared on Question Time. Charlotte Bence, of the performers’ union Equity, said it was too simple to put the kind of behaviour experienced by comics solely down to the pandemic. “It was a problem before,” she said. “[But] perhaps our ability to collectively distinguish between how we are when we’re in our own homes or with our very close friends versus how we are when we’re out and about has been knocked about, I don’t know.” Bence said harassment and bad behaviour towards acts was “only part of the story of how things for comics need to improve”. Equity is launching a comedians’ charter this summer at fringe festivals, aimed at making gigging safer for comics. Compiled by comedians, it calls for anti-harassment and discrimination policies to be displayed clearly in venues, with warnings that abuse will result in perpetrators being removed without a refund.",Arts/Culture,‘Forgotten how to behave’: comics say audiences more abusive post-lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/21/forgotten-how-to-behave-comics-say-audiences-more-abusive-post-lockdown

4/21/2022,"For anyone over the age of 25, TikTok is a baffling world of moronic dance routines and teenagers lip-syncing to each other’s conversations. Yet it’s also a hotbed of authentic culinary creativity. Dalgona coffee, cloud bread, feta pasta, the tortilla folding hack, hot chocolate bombs – these crossover food trends all gained popularity on the platform, and they are only the tip of the iceberg lettuce. But what makes certain dishes go viral, and are any of them any good? Will social media replace recipe books? In a transparent, ultimately pathetic attempt to stay relevant, I’ll be living largely off TikTok recipes for one week to find out, and keeping a food diary. Let’s go! Nature’s cereal @lizzo Pour coconut water over berries and ice. Eat. I doubt berries in water will replace wheat pieces in milk. Yet pop star Lizzo – among thousands of others – claims to be addicted. And, despite my scepticism, this is … fantastic? The smooth sweetness of coconut water lifts the blueberries and strawberries, with the pomegranate giving crunch. It’s supremely hydrating. Crunching on ice does feel a bit fashion week, though. And have you seen how much coconut water costs? I won’t be doing this again, any more than I’ll be sprinkling saffron in the bath and calling it aromatherapy. Nothing tastes as good as avoiding bankruptcy feels. Hasselback cheesy Marmite hot cross buns @thisisplanetfood Cut vertical slices into a Marmite hot cross bun. Stuff with cheese and grill to melt. Drizzle with Marmite to finish. Peckish after my water breakfast, I discover an intriguing snack. Hasselback may sound like an 80s German TV star, but it’s actually a way of increasing a potato’s buttering area by 10,000%. I was therefore intrigued by an idea courtesy of @thisisplanetfood, of deep-pleating a Marmite hot cross bun to concertina it with cheese. It’s unquestionably great, like five fluffy, mini cheese-on-toasts. Looks like I’m in for a good week. Jello frozen grapes @baybradyy Wash grapes and put in freezer bag, still wet. Shake in jelly powder. Freeze. I was ready to scoff at this health trend, in which frozen grapes are said to taste like juicy candy. But guess what – I dust, I freeze, I experience revelation. The sparkly globes that emerge are sharp and sweet and ice cold; addictive to eat, magical to behold. I scoff the lot; a grape success. Overnight Weetabix @eatwithjamielee Moisten Weetabix with milk, in a lunchbox. Spread with yoghurt and chopped strawberries, topped with strawberry conserve. Swirl toppings with a cocktail stick, then refrigerate. TikTok recipes are simple. That’s because the pop-music-scored videos are about eight seconds long, frantically edited and play on a loop that, after a while, makes you feel as if you’re being subjected to enhanced interrogation. The idea behind this massive 2022 trend is that, after a night in the fridge, thick yoghurt and Weetabix approximate the taste of cheesecake! If I was cheesecake, I’d consider legal action. This tastes like jam and yoghurt over Weetabix. Not bad, but have you ever had someone cancel plans just before you were going to? Now that’s delicious. Ramen lasagne @ramenkingivan Layer instant noodle nests with pasta sauce and cheese. Bake. How to explain the existence of ramen lasagne? It was created by Ivan McCombs, a Victor Frankenstein of instant noodles. He also has videos on how to make spring roll ramen, banana mayo ramen, microwave lobster ramen, coffee ramen and more. McCombs’ 6 million #ramfam followers lap up videos of him eating ramen with babyfood, or cooked in cream with melted Skittles, because this is who we are. The lasagne video has been viewed 20m times. Must dash as I’ve now consumed an entire jar of passata and am sweating tomatoes. Dalgona @saifshawaf Melt sugar in a pan. Add baking soda. Pour on to baking sheet, score to shape. Not to be confused with dalgona coffee, this old-fashioned Korean street sweet is better known as the Squid Game candy. You know, the episode where the contestants have to snap a shape accurately, or get shot in the head. It’s a bit of fun! It’s surprisingly easy to make, with just two ingredients. Whisking and pouring, I struggle to extract the cookie cutters from the quick-cooling foam without everything shattering. If I was in Squid Game, I would fall over my laces and stab myself with the pen while signing up. Pro tip: don’t taste caramel while it cooks – it is a red-hot glue that turns to fibreglass in your mouth. Happened to, er, a friend of mine. Custard toast @cookingwithayeh Make a custard. Indent a slice of bread, and pour in. Top with berries or chocolate drops, bake to set. Great to be reminded how easy it is to make custard – here it’s just yoghurt, an egg and maple syrup. The problem is the bread. You have to squidge it down with your fingers to make a shallow basin for the custard. The sourdough I’m using springs right back. Against my political beliefs, I buy white bread that costs 9p; it works much better but makes me sad. I also find that raspberries trap a lot of heat; it’s like eating magma off a baked playing card. Corn ribs @spicednice Quarter corn on the cob, lengthwise. Brush with a spicy oil mix, airfry until charred. Serve with chipotle mayo. This is more like it. TikToker @spicednice created corn ribs – with a nod to Mexican street food elotes – in a video that has 1.8m likes. While corn cobs are harder to slice than titanium, this is still a brilliant innovation. The corn curls as it bakes, taking on rib shape and colour, while the kernels get chewy under a smoky seasoning. Superb. I have since tried these at upmarket Mayfair restaurant Fallow, proof of how far a good idea can travel, no matter where it comes from. Smashed brussels sprouts @lowcarbstateofmind Trim sprouts, steam in microwave. Crush, spray with oil and garlic powder. Bake until crispy. What’s not to love about mini-cabbages? I Hulk-smash these, season, and in 15 minutes am enjoying crispy, garlicky little green sliders. With this recipe (as with many others), TikTokers are obsessed with air frying, but baking works just as well. Korean cheese corn dogs @stellanspice Mix yeast batter, let rise. Wrap a sausage in cheese, and skewer. Coat in batter, roll in diced potato and panko breadcrumb. Deep fry. I invite friends round for dinner, inspired by mukbang, the Korean TV genre in which hosts eat extreme foods in front of a live audience. TikTok also centres dishes with ASMR value: slurpy noods, crunchy nugs, with a sub-genre devoted to Korean corn dogs – half hotdog, half mozzarella, deep fried for the ultimate cheese pull. I wrap a cheese slice around a sausage, which immediately falls off. I compensate with too much yeasty paste. Rolling the hot mess in potato cubes doesn’t feel excellent. The resulting medieval club of batter and sausage, sans cheese, tastes weirdly OK. Sweetly boozy, tangy with cheap mustard and ketchup. I’m too old to mukbang, though. My stomach is squeaking and my friends left early. Yorkshire pudding profiteroles @foodmadesimple Squirt whipped cream in half a batch of cooled yorkshire puddings. Make lids with the rest, and dip in melted chocolate to seal. I tried this cultural atrocity on my friend, Yorkshire Jill. She wasn’t fazed by me squirting cream into the puddings but she did take exception to the puddings being shop-bought. She claimed to be unaware such a thing existed. Madness. It pains my inner purist to record that these chewy profiteroles, while a little heavy, somewhat too oily for the ambassador’s reception, aren’t bad. Crust pops @caughtsnackin Roll leftover white bread crusts into a swirl and skewer. Baste with butter, then grill, then dip in cinnamon sugar. I wake up with a second wind! These crust pops are super easy, and probably a fun thing to make with kids (unless your kids are on TikTok, hosting professional makeup tutorials and insulting you in a language you don’t understand). Let’s call them cinnamon pinwheels, because “crust pops” sounds like a late-stage skin condition. They make even 9p bread luscious, like a fairground treat. Still, I’ve had bigger thrills. Did you ever ride an empty escalator, pretending to be a Mayan king ascending to the Sky World? I might be hallucinating from lack of vitamins. Three-minute spicy cucumber salad @michelletiang Slice cucumber. Add sugar, salt, sesame oil, rice vinegar and crunchy chilli oil. Shake in lunchbox, refrigerate. In need of something green and speedy, I find a video of someone preparing food in real time! It feels like breathing for the first time in days. Michelle Tiang’s marinaded cucumber salad really does take three minutes, and is a juicy, piquant winner. She’s a mum of three, the only kind of influencer I trust. Carrot bacon @iamtabithabrown Shave carrot. Marinade in liquid smoke, maple syrup, smoked paprika, garlic and onion powder. Fry till crisp. Tabitha Brown’s carrot bacon video has 3.7m likes, and they can’t all be from pigs. (Hard to like and subscribe with trotters.) I don’t have liquid smoke, but use sriracha for colour and am impressed with the crispy strips that emerge. Spicy, deeply savoury, almost tandoori red. They are very easy to burn though, which at least compensates for the lack of artificial smoke. With all of my shopping earmarked for TikTok experiments, I raid the fridge for nutrients. I find a bag of iceberg lettuce and push my face into it, like the Titanic going down. Easy salmon sushi @emilymariko Flake leftover salmon into cooked sushi rice. Mix with kewpie mayonnaise and sriracha sauce. Scoop up with mini seaweed sheets. Now for an ancient (ie 2021) technique that I have genuinely incorporated into my repertoire since I first saw it. Vlogger Emily Mariko got 2 million followers from inventing sushi rice with salmon scooped up with mini seaweed sheets. I once grilled a slice of ham until it curled into a bowl, then cooked an egg inside that, and my only followers are stray dogs. I suppose this has broader appeal, especially with added spring onion, sesame seeds and crispy onion. It’s futomaki for sophisticated slatterns, and I love it with my whole heart. TikTok crinkle cake @ramenasaidwow Concertina filo pastry in a tray, two sheets at a time, and bake. Brush with melted sugar, bake again. Pour in custard, bake for a final time. Finish with sugar syrup. FoodTok is built on pudding. I’ve seen things you wouldn’t believe: people putting puddings inside cakes; people sandwiching cookie dough in Oreos and dipping them in chocolate. Aching kidneys tell me I shouldn’t go near any of that. I am taken with this recipe for crinkle cake however, which has 1.5m likes. It’s a multi-step process but easy. I tweak with pistachio and leftover cinnamon sugar from the crust pops. The result is incredible. Aromatic caramel crackling gives way to cool, vanilla-soaked layers and sweet perfume, something like Greek bougatsa. I will be eating this for the rest of my life. Which I suspect is 10 days. Rice paper boba tea @caughtsnackin Dunk rice paper in warm water, roll up and slice into balls. Place in cup with scoop of Nutella. Top with ice, tea and milk. DrinkTok is a wild west. People are making strawberry vodka shots with Haribo melted in a dishwasher. They’re mixing milk and Ribena. Let’s play it safe, I think. Bubble tea is kawaii! The video has such fast cuts, I miss the instruction to dunk the rice paper, and leave the sheets to collapse. Attempting to slice this ectoplasm, the balls stick to my fingers. When I use another finger to dislodge them, they stick to that, turning to gunk all the while. I feel like Winnie-the-Pooh. Cursing, I fling my hands up. Boba mess sticks to the ceiling, the cupboards; some gets trod into the carpet like chewing gum. When I decant tea over the few hairy bubbles I rescue, it runs down the cup, staining the carpet. And the taste? The worst thing ever put in a mouth. Green goddess salad @bakedbymelissa The phrase “viral salad” is hardly mouthwatering. It reminds me of the first time I used public transport after lockdown. Still, Melissa Ben-Ishay’s green goddess has 1.7m likes and I need vitamins. It’s a headache to chop, but with an entire cabbage in the slaw, plus a bag of spinach in the dressing, it’s got those to spare. (I’m using a recipe tweak from Delish.com, which adds feta and dill.) I blend the dressing – it’s neon green, as if Hannibal got to Kermit the Frog. Cheesy, yet acidulous and fresh, my guts feel some relief. Shame I’m pairing it with deep-fried chicken! Replica KFC Nashville chicken tenders @yashodhas_eats Marinade chicken in buttermilk and Cajun spices. Add hot sauce, rest. Coat in garlicky flour mix and deep-fry until golden. Recreating franchise food is huge on TikTok. There are instructional videos on making home-style Big Macs, Whoppers, Domino’s garlic and herb dip. I find a not-too-demented KFC-inspired video and follow it. Not quite 11 herbs and spices, but there’s smoky, spicy goodness here. I deep-fry the tenders, burn them, then eat eight. My stomach gurgles like an animal trying to talk. It’s had enough. I have too. Snickle @liamslunchbox Hollow gherkin, insert Snickers. Eat? Putting a Snickers inside a pickle started as a joke, yet numbers know no irony, and I’ve a job to finish. Maybe this is how strawberry v black pepper started? Or that huge caramel/salt collab? I close my eyes and bite. It’s certainly a job to finish. Heinous. I would describe this as an efficient way to ruin your day, your week and even your year. No wonder nature is trying to take away our sense of taste.

4/21/2022,"When Catherine, the mother of four-year-old Ethan, asked Scott Morrison about the Coalition’s plans for the national disability insurance scheme, the prime minister had an unfortunate response. Ethan is autistic and Morrison told Wednesday night’s debate he and Jenny were “blessed” to have “two children that don’t – that haven’t had to go through that”. Morrison initially blamed Labor for politicising his comments, though the reaction from an offended disability community suggests words matter. He later apologised. Another part of the exchange, which garnered significantly less attention, was more important to Catherine. When host Kieran Gilbert asked if she was satisfied with the PM’s answer – he noted the Coalition was “fully funding” the NDIS, Catherine revealed her son’s NDIS funding had been cut by 30%. Morrison showed concern and promised he and his staff would look into her case, a common and fair enough response from politicians in such a situation. Viewers might have thought Catherine’s funding situation was the sort of one-off bound to happen in a $30bn scheme now supporting 500,000 people. But the truth is, it’s not. We don’t know exactly how exactly many people have had their plans cut recently but the rising dissatisfaction is neatly captured by a 400% rise in legal appeals against NDIS decisions post-July 2021. Such an increase is shocking and cannot be dismissed. There has also been an avalanche of NDIS participants dumbfounded by cuts to their funding packages who have spoken to the media. In the Guardian, examples include Ian, who has motor-neurone disease and who had his 24-hour nursing support cut, and Sarah, who said she may have to quit her job because her 11-year-old autistic son’s package was cut by 70%. One mother, Michelle, who won a landmark NDIS funding case in the federal court, had her son Liam’s funding cut again late last year. These cases are not just in national media like the Guardian and the ABC’s PM program, but are also being covered by local papers and TV stations. Talkback hosts say when they mention the NDIS, they are flooded with callers complaining about cuts. The stories follow a similar pattern: a person with disability has been getting a previously funded support (like support workers, or transport funding, or therapies) but when their plan expires and is reviewed, the support – that is, the funding – is reduced or cut entirely. Advocates are certain something has changed in the NDIS, likely the internal advice given to NDIS planners making these decisions, but the government has insisted things are as normal. Yes, there are plenty of other cases where plans are still being increased, meaning the individual cuts are not captured by the overall national data, which shows only a 4% fall in average plan sizes in 2021. But disability advocacy organisations, who assist people with disability to challenge cuts to their plans, insist they’ve been flooded with an unprecedented requests for help. They are increasingly seeing plans reduced by 30%, 40% or 50% or more. And when they examine the letters that stressed and confused NDIS participants receive, they note an increase in the use of phrases such as that particular funding was not “value for money” or was a “parental responsibility”.

Critics say this can be explained by the increased – and admittedly unforeseen – number of participants joining the scheme, also an issue worthy of policy attention. It should be noted too, that the NDIS leadership last year established a secret Sustainability Action Taskforce, intended to “slow growth in spend per participant”. It has refused to exactly say what this secretive unit did, refusing FOI requests and stonewalling questions in parliament. Labor says that, like Catherine’s son, Ethan, many of the cuts are to the funding packages of autistic children. Advocates believe the NDIS leadership is concerned there are too many autistic children getting on the scheme, and too few moving off it despite “early intervention” support. In Catherine’s case, she noted the cuts to her son’s package after a first NDIS review “with no reason why” means she can’t “access intensive therapy” for Ethan. Labor outlined a plan to “fix” the scheme this week. Some pledges, such as a crackdown on rorting, need more detail, but the idea of a better planning and review process is a necessary acknowledgment that people with disability should not be forced to essentially take legal action – in some cases being pitted against lawyers from private firms hired by the NDIA – to get what they are entitled to. Many say dealing with these cuts – that is, gathering the evidence and information needed to challenge a decision – is like a full-time job. This is contrary to the very purpose of the NDIS. And indeed, this goes to one of the defences put forward by Morrison’s colleagues to defend his “blessed” comments – that meant he had been blessed not to have to deal with the NDIS. Morrison spoke glowingly about the NDIS, but he noted it “still has faults” and could be a “very difficult system” to navigate. If having to deal with the NDIS is not a “blessing”, that’s not a matter of bad luck. It’s a question of government policy and administration.",News/Australia news,Having to grapple with the NDIS is no blessing – it’s a matter of government policy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/having-to-grapple-with-the-ndis-is-no-blessing-its-a-matter-of-government-policy
4/21/2022,"This year’s particularly lavish and long-lasting blooms of former commercial narcissi – perhaps the bulbs having benefited from the cool damp weather of last August – draw attention from other floral indicators of advancing spring. On sheltered banks along narrow lanes, primrose, violet, uncurling ferns and stitchwort already merge between bluebells, while dandelion, nettle, dock and clinging strands of goosegrass dominate the tractor-rutted verges and hedge footings. Beside the stony track from Barrett’s Mill and the old silver mining area in Fullaford Road, primroses grow on long stems among rabbit-scuffed earth, all overblown by chilling winds and the savoury smell from Callington’s pasty factory. Further south, around warmer Burraton, celery-flavoured alexanders, with its yellow/green umbels, proliferates beside the minor road; an unsurfaced lane leads downhill past small grassy fields scattered with rogue daffodils – survivors from the days of market gardening. This enclave used to be a hub of productivity, intensively cultivated by tenants of the Cotehele estate, growing fruit, vegetables and flowers. The 1840 tithe map shows cherry gardens, a nursery, strawberry plots and a willow garden (probably for making baskets and punnets), and narcissi and strawberries were regularly picked for sale until the end of the 20th century. Across the little stream from Smeaton Farm, on steep north-facing, cattle-tracked pasture, neglected linear plots of daffodils – pale petalled and orange cupped – still flower every year; trees recently planted by the National Trust are guarded against rabbits and further protected from summer-grazing bullocks by substantial wooden fencing. The primrose path towards this ground is signed as one of the parish’s heritage trails, picturesque between high banks of cut back woody growth, entwined in tendrils of honeysuckle among early cherry blossom. Faded pheasant’s-eye narcissi tangle among brambles on the hedge-tops, and naturalise in the bluebell wood around Quarry Cottage. Best of all is a bank of full-out “butter and eggs”. This narcissus, dating from the 1700s, was once valued for its fragrance and magnificent double flowers, but was discarded in favour of the more “modern” varieties suited to picking in bud. How unusual, and how wonderful, to see a patch of them here, thriving in such abundance.  Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",News/Environment,Country diary: The spring flowers are beginning to burst,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/21/country-diary-the-spring-flowers-are-beginning-to-burst
4/21/2022,"On a sunny spring morning, few places can feel as peaceful as Lappeenranta, a small Finnish border city set on one of Europe’s biggest lakes. Yet the scenic views are deceiving – for the city’s 70,000 inhabitants, the mood has suddenly soured. “I have always felt very safe growing up here, but since the war that has somewhat changed,” said Noora Ikonen, a local barista. “I catch myself feeling anxious.” The war she refers to is being fought nearly 1,000 miles away in Ukraine. But Finland shares an 830-mile land border with Russia and Lappeenranta is only 19 miles from the frontier – closer to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s home city of St Petersburg than to the Finnish capital, Helsinki. “Naturally, locals here are concerned and worried. We were all shocked when Russia invaded Ukraine. We were used to working and living alongside Russians,” the city’s longtime mayor, Kimmo Jarva, said on Wednesday from his office overlooking the frozen bay on the Saimaa lake. After the Soviet Union’s fall, Lappeenranta epitomised Finland’s pragmatic relationship with Russia, which centred around developing business relations with Moscow while successive Finnish leaders maintained dialogue with Putin. Jarva estimated that 1.5 million Russians visited the city every year pre-pandemic, bringing in millions of euros in revenue, with some shops specifically catering to them. Lappeenranta also established its own office in St Petersburg and marketed itself to tourists in the west as a “gateway” to Russia. “We were always open to working with Russians. But everything changed after the war,” Jarva said. Very few cars now embark on the highway leading to the Finnish-Russian border as the two countries have practically banned all private and commercial traffic from entering each other’s territories. “This city has now chosen a different path. There will be no way back,” Jarva said. That path might soon lead to Finland, and neighbouring Sweden, joining the Nato military alliance, in what would be a historic policy shift for the two northern European states. The decision is considered critical, especially as Ukraine’s possible future membership of Nato was used as a key reason by Moscow for the invasion. On Wednesday, Finland’s parliament started discussing a government report outlining the implications and risks of Nato membership, marking the symbolic beginning of the official debate on a potential application to join the defensive block. Officials have already indicated that they do not expect a lengthy debate, with the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, saying last week that her country would decide whether to apply “quite fast, in weeks not months”. Ikonen, the barista, said that she fully backed joining Nato, and her sentiment is echoed by others on the city’s streets. Just five years ago, Ikonen’s support would have placed her among the minority in Finland, with polls showing that only 21% of the population backed joining the alliance, a figure that did not fluctuate much for decades. However, the invasion of Ukraine has led to a tectonic shift in public opinion towards the bloc that could result in Nato forces being stationed on Russia’s extensive north-western border. “Finland decided it wanted to join Nato on 24 February at 5am when Russian forces went into Ukraine,” former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb said. In polls taken after the invasion, roughly 60% of Finns said they would favour applying to join Nato, a figure Stubb expects to only grow in the coming weeks. “If Russia is ready to slaughter their Slavic brothers in Ukraine, why would it not do the same thing with Finland? Many Finns woke up and said: ‘Enough! Now it is time to join Nato,’” Stubb added. Himself a longtime Nato advocate, Stubb argued it was only natural that Finns had changed their stance in response to Russia’s actions. “Finns are very rational, pragmatic people. They adjust their opinion as the circumstances change. Now people have realised Russia is an unpredictable and isolated aggressor.” The speed with which views have changed has, however, surprised even those watching Finnish politics closely. “No one I know can think of anything remotely similar in Finnish history where public opinion has changed so quickly, so radically,” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a security expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “We thought it would be the political elites that would push for Nato, but it is the opposite. The Finns themselves have chosen this path,” he said. Experts argue that Finland’s current sentiments are rooted in its own war with Moscow, which has echoes of the invasion of Ukraine. In 1939-40, the gruelling Winter War resulted in Finland conceding a large part of its territory to the Soviet Union, including the city of Vyborg, only a 30-minute train ride from Lappeenranta. “The solidarity with Ukraine is huge. We are seeing a lot of comparison between Ukraine and the Winter War in the media, in public debates,” said Arkady Moshes of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. According to Moshes, many Finns “instinctively turn to stories” of the Winter War when they see Ukraine fighting a bigger, more powerful neighbour on their own. “Finns aren’t very open about their emotions, but what is happening in Ukraine has brought up sentiments that seemed to have been kept inside for decades,” Moshes said. A recent poll showed that 84% of Finns now believe that Russia poses a significant military threat. “My generation didn’t experience any wars, but my parents and grandparents were forced to flee to the west of the country during the war with the Soviets,” said Heli Pukki, the owner of an art shop in Lappeenranta. “But we were brought up with their experiences, we carried them in our hearts.” Pukki said she did not feel any hate toward Russians and would always “happily welcome” them in her shop, but the war in Ukraine changed something overnight. “This is the first time in my life that I started thinking about my safety, about my peaceful life here. We always knew that we had this big country on our border, but now it feels like something is really boiling there, the country not moving in the right direction. No one knows what will happen next,” she said. Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the move would destabilise Europe. Last week, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev issued the country’s strongest threat yet, warning that Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea if Finland and Sweden join Nato. Medvedev also raised the nuclear threat by warning that there could be no more talk of a “nuclear-free” Baltic – where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave between Poland and Lithuania. But while locals expressed some concern about possible Russian reactions to the country’s plans to join Nato, Finnish experts and officials have urged calm, saying their country is prepared for any aggression. “The nuclear threat is nothing new,” said Stubb, pointing to reports that Russia is already keeping nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad. “We expect more Russian cyber-attacks and airspace violations. But we have been preparing for this for a long time,” he said. Stubb and other analysts dismissed the possibility that Russia would be able to threaten Finland militarily in the near future. “Russia can’t fight on two fronts, and they would be facing one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world. As always, we remain calm, cool and collected. We know what we are doing,” the former prime minister said. Finland has maintained strong defence spending over the last 30 years while the rest of Europe has largely made cuts. The Nordic state is also one of the few European countries to have retained military conscription, and almost a third of its adult population are reservists. Lappeenranta’s mayor, Jarva, similarly said he did not expect any military threats coming out of Moscow, adding the border has “never been quieter”. Nevertheless, he said his city had thoroughly checked all its bomb shelters shortly after the start of Russia’s invasion. “This is what we always do, we stay prepared. The war just makes us a bit more motivated to do so.”",News/World news,‘There will be no way back’: will war change Finland’s pragmatic approach to Russia?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/there-will-be-no-way-back-will-war-change-finlands-pragmatic-approach-to-russia
4/21/2022,"Barack and Michelle Obama are leaving Spotify amid reports of frustration over the terms of their multimillion dollar deal to exclusively make podcasts with the streaming giant, according to Bloomberg. The Obamas announced in 2019 they would partner exclusively with Spotify to release podcasts through their media company Higher Ground, in a deal rumoured to be worth $25m. Renegades: Born in the USA, Barack Obama’s show with musician Bruce Springsteen, and The Michelle Obama Podcast, have both been successes for Spotify. However, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Higher Ground will leave Spotify when the current deal ends in October, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the discussions as confirming that Higher Ground was talking to potential new partners, and that Spotify had declined to make another offer. The sources told Bloomberg that Higher Ground had become frustrated with the limited audience reach that came with the exclusive periods guaranteed to Spotify in the deal, and wanted to be able to distribute its shows more widely. Spokespeople for both Higher Ground and Spotify have not yet commented. Disagreements between Higher Ground and Spotify were first widely reported in February, with Spotify reportedly wanting the Obamas to personally appear in more shows, rather than one eight-episode limited series each. In turn, the Obamas were focused on promoting lesser-known voices on their slate of podcasts, which include Tell Them, I Am, which is focused on Muslim stories, and The Big Hit Show, which explores significant moments in pop culture. The Obamas’ Spotify deal came amid a burst of post-presidency commercial deals for the couple, which included a Netflix deal to make movies and shows with Higher Ground, a record publishing deal for multiple books with Penguin Random House, and events for Live Nation. Even though their podcasts will continue to be distributed through Spotify if Higher Ground signs a non-exclusive deal elsewhere, the Obamas’ exit would be a blow to the platform.

4/21/2022,"Support for fossil fuels is a theme in this election campaign, but you sometimes have to look closely to find the details. Ten days in, the Coalition has announced or confirmed more than $800m in funding for fossil fuel developments. The biggest commitment was tied up in an “energy and emissions reduction agreement” between the federal Coalition and the Northern Territory Labor government, signed shortly before the government went into caretaker mode and revealed after the campaign began. The announcement focuses on plans to start fracking in the Beetaloo Basin, a vast undeveloped gas region that analysts have said could contain enough fossil fuels to increase Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 13% if fully developed. The Morrison government has promised $660m as part of the agreement, including continuing to carve up $226m of public funding “to accelerate the development of the Beetaloo Basin through the stategic basin plan”. The deal also includes $300m for fossil fuel development in Darwin. It will go to supporting the production of liquefied natural gas for export and “clean” hydrogen (read: made with gas), and carbon capture use and storage infrastructure (CCS). Smaller sums in the deal are promised for renewable energy technology, including up to $45m in joint funding for a large battery and $15m to deploy microgrids in remote Indigenous communities. But the promise of more gas was the headline. In his statement, Scott Morrison said the deal would “unlock more local gas and create jobs and economic development in the Northern Territory, all while helping Australia to lower emissions and achieve our target of net zero [emissions] by 2050”. This is a persistent claim by the Morrison government, some Labor MPs and the influential gas industry lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association: that extracting and burning more fossil fuels can help cut emissions and eventually get us to net zero. Logic would suggest adding new fossil fuel infrastructure that is meant to last decades is a strange way to eradicate the stuff from our economy in that timeframe. Gas proponents argue otherwise – that the fossil fuel is pushing out coal, which has higher emissions when burned, and that gas-fired power is needed to support renewable energy. They also suggest CCS – which usually involves burning emissions underground, and so far remains economically unviable in most cases despite billions of dollars of public support – could provide a future. Neither the government nor the industry have presented evidence that Australian gas is mostly replacing coal. About three-quarters of gas extracted here is exported to Asia. Obviously enough, the driving motive for the companies involved is profit, not addressing the climate crisis. Government reports have previously noted that in Japan, Australian gas was competing with zero emissions nuclear and renewable energy. In some places it is competing for new energy demand that could be met in a range of ways, including cleaner sources – if there was the political and corporate will to act in line with the temperature targets set at UN climate summits. The agreement between the federal and NT governments is subsidising efforts to pull in the opposite direction. In terms of the gas needed for some manufacturing industries and power generation in Australia, several studies have found it could be met without opening up new basins. The demand from Australia’s gas power plants is small – there aren’t many of them and, because gas power in the eastern states is expensive, they only run when absolutely needed. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) doesn’t forecast a huge change in that as more coal plants shut and solar and wind farms are built. No conversation about gas should ignore the evidence that it is a significant and growing part of the climate problem. While it is often described as having about half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal when burned, the impact on global heating is higher once methane leaks during extraction and transport are factored in. The head of the International Energy Agency, traditionally seen as relatively bullish on fossil fuels, is among those to have warned the world should not open new oil and gas fields if it is serious about efforts to limit heating to 1.5C, a goal that is quickly slipping from grasp. But here we are. The Beetaloo is not the only fossil fuel project to get support during the campaign. Morrison also announced $67m for CCS projects in Western Australia, including $40m that will go to a development by energy giant Woodside on the Burrup Peninsula. And he pledged $250m for Australia’s two remaining oil refineries, in the name of improving fuel quality and the country’s diminishing fuel security. The possibility of accelerating Australia’s adoption of electric vehicles to start reducing the country’s reliance on imported, highly polluting oil was not mentioned. On coal, the Coalition and Labor were in lockstep on the future of the industry. Following reports that three coal mega-mines in Queensland’s massive Galilee Basin could be up for approval, Anthony Albanese said Labor’s position was clear – any proposals would be assessed by officials following national environment law (which does not consider the climate impact in any significant way), and if they stacked up, they could go ahead. Whether they were commercially viable would be a decision for the companies. “Labor would welcome any jobs that would be created from that,” Albanese said. Given Labor’s need to win seats in Queensland, and the belief that in 2019, north of Brisbane, support waned due to confusion over whether the party supported fossil fuel developments, there was nothing surprising in this stance. Both parties argue there is no need to stem coal exports until international demand dries up. In Morrison’s words, coal plants should run for “as long as they possibly can”. These decisions can have obvious ramifications for the climate, but it is worth noting it is also disputed that they make short-term economic sense. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that pushing fossil fuels overseas in the name of helping developing countries grow just locks in polluting energy sources that are increasingly more expensive than renewables. A new study from the Australian National University suggests MPs may have to confront the issue of declining coal demand sooner than they expect, at least from China. It forecast demand could fall by at least a quarter from 2019 to 2025. We have written elsewhere on the Coalition and News Corp’s attempts to reignite the climate wars through front page stories claiming Labor’s policy of bringing forward transmission connections to renewable energy zones could add nearly 50% to electricity prices over a decade. The Clean Energy Council, an industry body and lobby group, has done its own factcheck of the claim, backed with references. It’s worth a look. Its key point is that a blueprint for a future optimal grid by Aemo found reaching the bipartisan goal of net zero emissions by 2050 could require a nine-fold increase in large-scale renewable energy, a five-fold rise in rooftop solar and a trebling in “firming” support from batteries, hydro, virtual power plants and gas. Putting that together could require more than 10,000 kilometres of new transmission infrastructure. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It also suggested about 14 gigawatts of the ageing coal power fleet – more than half the total – could shut by 2030. That could demand significantly more transmission to connect the renewable energy needed to replace it. In its integrated system plan, Aemo found the transmission projects it outlined could deliver net economic benefits worth about $29bn. That’s more than twice the expected cost. There are arguments to be had about what is the best – and cheapest – way to build the power grid of the future. It’s an incredibly complicated question, and smart people acting in good faith differ on the answer. But the bottom line is that this inevitable change is coming, quite possibly faster than MPs acknowledge, and needs to be managed.",News/Environment,A close look at the election campaign’s energy promises shows major parties still back fossil fuels | Temperature Check,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/21/a-close-look-at-election-campaign-promises-shows-major-parties-still-back-fossil-fuels

The text permits China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”. Speaking to the BBC, Ardern said: “One of the reasons we’ve expressed this disappointment [is] … Australia and New Zealand both have heeded the call of the Solomons for support during recent disruption. “And we’ve again highlighted that should any extended need exist, we are there to help and support. What gap remains that requires such an agreement with China?” China had exhibited a “growing assertiveness” and “growing interest” in the Pacific region, Ardern said, but New Zealand and Beijing had a “mature relationship” and must continue to work together on areas of mutual interest. “Our world is changing around us and our region is a manifestation of that,” Ardern said. The signing of the security deal is reverberating in the Australian federal election campaign, with the Labor opposition accusing the Coalition prime minister, Scott Morrison, of presiding over a “Pacific stuff-up”. The New Zealand foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta told RNZ on Thursday morning there had been a lack of visibility and transparency from Solomon Islands and China over their agreement, and rejected any notion that its signing was a major foreign policy failure on behalf of Australia or New Zealand. “We’ve got to remember that even the local community in the Solomon Islands don’t have visibility on this issue and the parliament is split on the terms and conditions of the agreement, which they too have not seen,” Mahuta said. Mahuta said New Zealand had upheld its part of the Biketawa declaration – which outlines how Pacific Islands Forum countries will respond to regional crises – including responding to unrest in Honiara in 2021. The forum should make it a critical agenda item so all Pacific nations could discuss regional security and sovereignty, Mahuta said. “It’s going to be a matter of trying to bring the Solomons into a conversation, rather than the Solomons feeling like they’re defending their sovereignty and they’re being outcast by the rest of the Pacific.” China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner by a substantial margin and accounts for about a third of total exports, which has led to speculation Wellington is unable to take tough stances on Beijing. Ardern rejected the idea that it was time to join Aukus – the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the UK and the US aimed at confronting China. Speaking to the BBC, she said: “Our call on Aukus is simply that yes, it is to our benefit when we have greater engagement,” she said. “We’ve asked the US to take an interest in the economic architecture of our region, it can’t just be about defence and security arrangements.“It should be about the wellbeing of the region as a whole. And you’re starting to see a response from the US on that front.” The Australian Labor party’s opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, told the ABC: “Solomon Islands is a sovereign nation and of course they make their own decisions, but that does not absolve Mr Morrison and this government of their responsibility for what has happened on their watch.” Labor cited figures showing Australia’s bilateral official development assistance to Solomon Islands averaged $167.5m a year under the Coalition government. That figure was about 28% lower than the $231.6m average under the former Labor government. The Australian government has previously said it has offered additional assistance to the Pacific in separate programs, including Covid-related help. Australia’s Coalition minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, said Wong had “fundamentally misrepresented the situation and, in fact, completely misdiagnosed the response”. Seselja, who travelled to Honiara last week to “respectfully” urge Sogavare not to proceed with the deal, told Sky News the Australian government was “spending a record amount when it comes to aid in the region, when it comes to security arrangements in the region, when it comes to our Covid response”. “We have stepped up in every way,” he said. “Solomon Islands is the third largest aid spend we do anywhere in the world, the second largest in our region in the Pacific after PNG.” Seselja said Sogavare’s comments that Solomon Islands would not allow China to set up a military base in the country were “important assurances” and “we have to take them at face value”. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, hit back at suggestions the government was blindsided by the deal. He said he had “known for some time the risk of a deal such as this coming about” and that was why he chose Solomon Islands for his first international trip after the 2019 election. “And I spoke to the prime minister there on that occasion about the threats that China presented to the region, and we discussed those issues back on that occasion, and there has been an ongoing dialogue over that entire time,” Morrison said. “The threat of this has been around for a long time and I can’t go into all the details as to how Australia is able to know the specific information, as they are security matters, but what I do know is we have always been very conscious of that threat of China being able to influence a nation in our region to ends such as that.” Morrison added that China was “an autocratic nation that is not playing by the normal rules on how they seek to influence other nations in our region”. He said he had discussed the matter with Ardern “many times” and they would be talking about it as part of the Pacific Islands Forum.",News/World news,Jacinda Ardern questions motive for China-Solomons security pact,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/jacinda-ardern-questions-motive-for-china-solomons-security-pact
4/21/2022,"For the samba lovers responsible for what Brazilians call the greatest show on earth, it was a time of uncharacteristic seclusion and pain. Costume-makers, percussionists and composers lost their lives and loved ones as Covid-19 decimated Rio’s carnival community, and forced its rollicking annual parades to be cancelled for the first time since the 1930s. “It was tough. Our social networks became one big obituary,” said Marquinho Marino, the carnival director at Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel, one of Rio’s top samba schools. Marino thought no group had lost more members to Covid. “I lost count at 59,” said the samba chief – who nearly joined the list himself. He fell ill in May 2020 as Brazil’s death toll soared, and ended up in intensive care, while his pregnant wife waited desperately at home for news. “It destroys you psychologically,” the 46-year-old said of his battle with a disease that has killed more than 660,000 Brazilians and 6.1 million people worldwide. “You’re in hospital with an illness that nobody understands, people are dying all around you, and all you can think is: ‘I’m next.’” However, Marino survived and nearly two years later, Mocidade is back and gearing up for Rio’s first parade since February 2020. On that occasion, the school clinched third place with a tribute to the late Brazilian singer Elza Soares, who like Mocidade, was born in the Vila Vintém favela in west Rio. At around midnight on 23 April, Mocidade’s 3,500 members and five spectacular floats will set off towards the Sambódromo, a purpose-built parade venue in downtown Rio, which became a vaccination centre at the height of Brazil’s epidemic. Marino, a Mocidade fanatic since his first parade in 1981, is desperate to win. “We want to be champions and we’re perfectly placed to achieve that,” he said, the strain of recent late nights clear from the bags under his eyes. “More than the return of carnival, it signifies the return of normal life. There’s no greater triumph than that,” said Marino, whose office was plastered with top-secret images of the school’s 2022 costumes. Covid was not just an emotional blow to Mocidade, which was founded by a group of football enthusiasts in the mid-1950s, and has won six carnival titles. For Highor Pfaltzgraff, 25, the school’s costume and prop purchaser, it was a logistical nightmare as he struggled to source fabrics and trimmings usually imported from Asia. “So many things didn’t arrive from China because of the pandemic. So on top of everything else, we had to deal with a shortage of materials,” he said. One of the more peculiar scarcities was of the faux ivory teeth used to decorate costumes. “We needed 9,000 but we’ve only found about 4,000,” complained Pfaltzgraff, as tailors and artisans busied themselves in their fourth-floor atelier to the sound of Lady Gaga. For Bruna Santos, the school’s 24-year-old flag bearer, Covid was a choreographic headache, as she battled to stay fit despite government instructions to stay home. “Our bodies aren’t just machines you can turn on and off,” Santos said, remembering how lockdown had forced her to resort to online classes. “We’ve spent nearly two years practicing now. I can’t take any more!” Santos joked as she prepared to lead one of Mocidade’s final public rehearsals through the streets of west Rio. Moments later, the school’s drum section sprung to life around her, its members pounding bass drums stamped with the portraits of fabled percussionists such as Bira, André and Jorjão. Percussion director Eugênio Rodrigues remembered his awe at being invited to attend his first Mocidade practice by Jorjão in the early 90s. “Those guys were truly unique … I mirrored myself on them. I thought I’ve got to be as good as them or even better.” Rodrigues, 50, said those samba trailblazers had been notorious disciplinarians with zero tolerance for mistakes. Covid had instilled a similar doggedness in his drum section as its 276 members strove for perfection in Rio’s carnival comeback. “That’s what all this time apart has done to us. People want victory so much more.” Rodrigues also believed Mocidade was well-placed to win a seventh top-flight title. “We’ve got a good samba. Our drum section’s really well rehearsed … Our opening troupe’s amazing. The costumes look bloody beautiful. Mocidade’s floats are enormous. We have it within our reach,” he enthused, before admitting there was no telling what might happen in the storied confines of Oscar Niemeyer’s Sambódromo. “What happens down there is mystical,” he said, as Mocidade aficionados packed the suburban square around him for that evening’s dry run. As night fell, the group began its 700-metre procession, designed to replicate the pageant where schools will be scrutinised by 45 judges on nine different criteria, including costumes, drumming and floats. Clutching cymbal rattles, tambourines and fluorescent green glow sticks, they danced east towards the school’s headquarters, past graffiti-covered houses and a Baptist church emblazoned with the words: “Only Jesus Christ Saves.” As they progressed, Mocidade’s members sung of a different religious figure: Oxóssi, the Afro-Brazilian god of nature and hunting, celebrated by the school’s 2022 samba. Santos, a follower of the Umbanda faith, said she would seek spiritual protection to ward off bad energy as she spearheaded Mocidade’s quest for glory. “When parade time comes, it’s complete madness – it’s a mixture of joy and nervousness because it’s such a huge responsibility. You’re representing the dream of a whole community.” Under the amber glow of streetlights, the athletic flag-bearer pirouetted towards the finish line, trailed by hundreds of sweat-drenched revellers and a man dressed as a bright green beaver: the symbol of the extravagant mafia boss Castor de Andrade, who sponsored Mocidade until his death in 1997. Before her stood the school’s historic nerve centre and a banner carrying some words of encouragement from Hollywood’s king of fantasy Walt Disney: “If you can dream it, you can do it.”",News/World news,‘No greater triumph’: excitement builds in Rio for carnival’s return,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/rio-carnival-2022-more-than-the-return-of-carnival-it-signifies-the-return-of-normal-life
4/21/2022,"Tins of spaghetti, soap, pasta shells and raw almonds: purchases more commonly carted into New Zealand homes by shopping trolleys and car boots than jetted on international flights. But as prices hit new highs, shoppers are taking drastic measures – including ordering groceries for delivery from Australia. “It’s almost like Christmas,” said Belinda*, a Wellington woman who said she now regularly ordered groceries online from across the Tasman to supplement her local shopping. Browsing Australian groceries, she said, she was startled by the range of products and how much cheaper they were than those stocking New Zealand shelves. The Guardian compared two shopping carts compiled by Belinda – one from an Australia-based multinational which delivered to New Zealand, the second to have the same items delivered by one of New Zealand’s largest supermarket chains. In total, even with the currency conversion, cost of GST and a small customs fee, she saved almost NZ$70 (AU$64) on a $267 shop – or about $80 including the local supermarket’s delivery charge. “The only ​​downside also is that a lot of things are currently unavailable because of stock issues. But I think that’s because everybody started to do it,” she said. In late March, an Otago woman gained national attention after she posted her Australian-purchased shopping cart on social media. She told TV 1 that while she had saved about 35% on her groceries by bulk-buying nuts, dry goods and toiletries, she was unlikely to repeat the experiment. “I wouldn’t recommend others do it because the order is flown in so it’s not good for your carbon footprint,” she said. “Also I now have 10 toothbrushes and a year’s worth of almonds to get through.” Shoppers speaking to the Guardian said that while time consuming, the practice had saved them more than 25% on equivalent shops at home. A number of the shoppers were concerned about the climate impact of flying their goods in rather than buying locally – but said with food prices rising steeply in New Zealand, the practice illustrated the desperate measures families were taking to alleviate costs. In March, food prices in New Zealand were 7.6% higher than the year before, the largest annual increase in over a decade. Fruit and vegetables were up 18%, hitting many households that were already stretched by high petrol prices, rising rents and increasing mortgage payments. On Thursday, annual inflation hit 6.9% – the highest in three decades. Earlier in the week, finance minister Grant Robertson said he believed it would continue to rise, pushed up by international pressures. Emma Anderson, 38, from North Canterbury, said she had started ordering from Australia as groceries at home became increasingly unaffordable, and got the idea after seeing another woman’s experience in an online budgeting group. “The prices have just gone screaming through the roof,” she said. “It’s just completely overboard – it’s certainly making me rethink how I grocery shop.” Now, Emma will compare prices across several supermarkets and in Australia to find the best deal before purchasing. In July 2021, a commerce commission investigation into New Zealand’s supermarket duopoly found the grocers were making huge profits and charging some of the highest prices in the OECD. For those turning to Australia for cheap basics, their shopping was limited to non-perishable items – pantry staples like pastas, flour, cans and sauces, dried fruit. Both Belinda and Emma said that to actually make a saving required some deft deal-hunting, and buying $60 worth of groceries – enough to hit the free delivery threshold. “The biggest cost is your time – it takes some time,” Belinda said. A member of Belinda’s household was severely immuno-compromised and at risk from Covid infection, so despite lifting restrictions, their home had remained in a mini-lockdown: working from home and ordering groceries online. Most New Zealand supermarkets required a higher minimum spend or regular fee for delivery, she said. Ultimately, she’d prefer to buy local, and said she was concerned about the environmental impact of ordering groceries from overseas. “But you know,” she said, “I’ve gotta do what I’ve gotta do.” *Belinda’s name has been changed at her request to protect the privacy of her household",News/World news,New Zealand shoppers order groceries from Australia as inflation soars,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/new-zealand-shoppers-order-groceries-from-australia-as-inflation-soars
4/21/2022,"The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, rejected a push for changes to the Sex Discrimination Act aimed at excluding transgender people from single-sex sport late last year, despite Scott Morrison embracing the issue throughout the election campaign. In February, the Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler introduced into the Senate the Save Women’s Sport bill, which the controversial Liberal candidate Katherine Deves has claimed she helped develop. Morrison has praised Chandler’s bill as “terrific”, and revealed he had encouraged the conservative senator to pursue the legislation, saying he believed she was “outspoken and brave” and “a champion for women’s sport”. He has also said that he shares “their views” on the issue. “I think she’s been right to raise these issues in the way that she has. Well done, Claire,” Morrison said in February. The prime minister indicated at the start of the campaign that he shared Chandler’s views on the issue and would “have more to say” about it, but later said there was no plan for it to become government legislation. But before Chandler introduced the bill, Deves presented a petition to Parliament calling for many of the same changes to the Sex Discrimination Act, which was roundly rejected by Cash in November. The petition, which was organised by Deves as co-founder of Save Women’s Sport Australasia and had more than 5,000 signatures, was tabled in Parliament by the Nationals MP Ken O’Dowd in October. In response, Cash said the government was not considering any changes to the act and defended its current operation, including for sport. “The Australian government believes all people are entitled to respect, dignity and the opportunity to participate in society, regardless of their personal attributes, and recognises that to enjoy civil and political rights on an equal basis with others, people need to be able to do so free from discrimination,” she said in a letter dated 18 November. “The Sex Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination on the grounds of gender identity, sexual orientation and intersex status in many areas of public life, including employment, education, and in the provision of goods, services and facilities. “In this context, the Australian government recognises that individuals may identify and be recognised within the community as a gender other than the sex they were assigned at birth or during infancy, or as a gender which is not exclusively male or female. “In relation to competitive sporting activity, the Sex Discrimination Act provides that it is not unlawful discrimination on the grounds of sex, gender identity or intersex status to exclude a person from participating in competitive sporting activity, in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant.” The petition called for many of the same things that ended up in Chandler’s legislation, including amendments to the act to include biological definitions of men and women. The petition demands that the act “unequivocally express that the female sports category is for biological females only”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite Cash’s rejection of the proposed changes, Morrison has continued to stand by Chandler and Deves, even after offensive comments from Deves about transgender children and comparisons of anti-trans activism to opposing the Holocaust prompted widespread calls for her to be disendorsed. Deves, the Liberal candidate for the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah, has apologised for some of her comments, saying the language she used was “not acceptable”. Morrison has doubled down on his support for Deves this week, saying he would resist pressure to “cancel” her. A leaked text message also suggested he had the backing of the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet. said. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Morrison was asked whether he felt “comfortable” about his daughters playing sport against someone who was transgender. “Sports will make their decisions, but my preference is for girls to play girls, women to play women, boys to play boys, and men to play men. I don’t think this is a terribly remarkable statement, I think it is common sense,” he said. “For those who are trans, I want them to participate in sport as well, I want them to have opportunities fo inclusion in sport, I want every Australian to be treated with dignity but also we need to have some common sense here.” He did not answer a question about whether the Liberal party was preventing Deves from speaking to the media. “I’ve been in contact again with Katherine today, encouraging her. Katherine is passionate about the issue of women and girls in sport, and I think the position that she has set out on that issue is one that I think finds a lot of resonance with Australians who just want common sense to apply in this situation.” Morrison has also indicated that the Coalition party room would want to consider the Chandler legislation before any debate in Parliament. “Sensitive matters like this have often been raised by private members, and they’ve often been allowed go forward for debate in the parliament, and members have been able to have a conscience vote on these matters,” Morrison said on Sunday. “Now we are in the middle of an election campaign, there isn’t an opportunity for us to have those discussions in party room,” he said. “But this has always been my instinct on these matters. “You know, there are many different views on this. There are many, many different views on this, so I’m not seeking to bind at all any of my members of parliament on these issues as a party position.” Asked for his view on transgender participation in sport on Wednesday, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the issue was covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. “It’s covered that girls should be able to play sport against girls and boys should be able to play sport against boys. And that should be covered, it is covered, by the Sex Discrimination Act and that sports currently are in control of this issue.”",News/Australia news,"Michaelia Cash rejected transgender sports changes last year, despite Morrison embracing issue",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/michaelia-cash-rejected-transgender-sports-changes-last-year-despite-morrison-embracing-issue
