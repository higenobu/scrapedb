1/7/2022,"Pakistan’s top judicial commission has nominated a female judge to the supreme court for the first time in the country’s history. The move to pave the way for Justice Ayesha Malik to join the court has been widely praised by lawyers and civil society activists as a defining moment in the struggle for gender equality in Pakistan.  The parliamentary secretary for law and justice, Maleeka Bokhari, called it a “shattering of the glass ceiling”. “An important and defining moment in our country as a brilliant lawyer and decorated judge has become Pakistan’s first female SC [supreme court] judge,” Bokhari, a junior minister of the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf party, wrote on Twitter. The 55-year-old’s appointment has been supported by the chief justice of Pakistan, Gulzar Ahmed, and now goes to a parliamentary panel for confirmation. The decision has not been without opposition, with one group of lawyers threatening to strike if Malik joined the supreme court bench. The nine-member commission turned down her appointment to the court last year, but this time the decision of the panel of judges was five votes to four in her favour. A number of lawyers and judges said her selection violated the rules in terms of seniority, maintaining that she was not among the top three senior judges in the court from which she was nominated – the Lahore high court, where Malik has served since 2012. Imaan Mazari-Hazir, a lawyer in Islamabad, said: “Women have, in the past, been blocked from becoming chief justices of their respective high courts and the fact that we did not have a single woman in the supreme court until now illustrates that there is indeed deep-rooted misogyny in the legal fraternity.” Malik has given some landmark verdicts in her career, last year outlawing virginity tests for female rape survivors. “It is a humiliating practice, which is used to cast suspicion on the victim, as opposed to focusing on the accused and the incident of sexual violence,” she said in her verdict, which only applies in the state of Punjab. Nighat Dad, a digital rights lawyer and human rights activist, said Malik had proved “her competence in the courtroom”. “Justice Ayesha Malik’s appointment is a historic move for our judicial system as it is not only the first time a woman has a seat in the supreme court since Pakistan’s inception, but it opens up endless possibilities for other women in the legal field,” she said. “In a country where crimes of gender-based violence are a constant reality, more women in the supreme court can hopefully have a domino effect on the larger justice system to be more inclusive,” said Dad, adding that the law had “immense barriers for women and marginalised communities”.",News/Global development,First female judge nominated for Pakistan’s supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/07/first-female-judge-nominated-for-pakistans-supreme-court
1/7/2022,"British farmers have criticised Asda’s decision to backtrack on its promise to sell only British beef. The retailer said the U-turn was the result of higher beef prices, and it would now sell both Irish and British-produced beef in its stores.  The move comes just over a year after the supermarket chain, under its new owners the Issa brothers, made a pledge to source 100% British beef. The retailer only managed to fulfil its commitment last October. Neil Shand, the chief executive of industry body the National Beef Association (NBA), said he was “very disappointed that Asda wasn’t able to continue its commitment beyond two months”. The NBA estimates that farm gate prices for British beef have risen by around 20% since the start of the pandemic. However, farmers warn that the higher prices they are receiving for their produce are offset by the soaring costs of feed, fuel and fertiliser. “The higher price for beef is being eroded,” said Shand. “Asda may claim beef is too expensive, but it can’t be produced at a lower price.” Asda said: “We know that it is important to our customers that the beef on our shelves has been produced to high welfare standards and is affordable. Unfortunately, the price of British beef has risen and whilst we continue to work hard to keep prices as low as possible for our customers, these increases are significant.” The retailer added that all of the beef sold in its premium Extra Special range would remain 100% British. Irish beef is about 20% cheaper than British beef, according to the Irish Examiner. The UK is Ireland’s main overseas market for its beef, and accounted for more than three-quarters (78%) of beef imports entering the UK in 2019, according to figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB). Richard Findlay, the chair of the livestock board of the National Farmers Union (NFU), said farmers needed support from retail, given the post-Brexit changes to agriculture policy, and at a time when they were looking to invest in environmentally friendly food production. “Given the significant changes to trade and agricultural policy, it is more important than ever that our retailers champion British food and farming and that, fundamentally, any sourcing commitments they make are honoured,” Findlay said. Shand said he was pleased that six grocers – Waitrose, Marks &Spencer, Morrisons, Co-op, Aldi and Lidl – had maintained their commitment to selling exclusively British beef.",News/Business,Asda ditches pledge to sell only British beef over higher prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/asda-ditches-pledge-to-sell-only-british-beef-over-higher-prices
1/7/2022,"It doesn’t take a genius to see why green feels aspirational at the precise moment in history when we humans finally seem to be twigging that a green future is the only future that is going to exist. Green is good. Green is the zeitgeist. So, what to wear? Green – but make it fashion. The expression “but make it fashion” means to add a splash of showbiz, but also a hit of sharpness. A dash of syrup, plus a squeeze of lime. If the taste is too vanilla, that’s not fashion. Which is how we have ended up with a colour-of-the-moment that symbolises nature, but actually looks a bit synthetic. The green that is everywhere right now is a flat, saturated, straightforward green. It is not the colour of moss or of olives or of sea foam.  No, it is the colour of green-screen technology. It is bold and brash and full of main-character energy. It is neither dazzling like emerald nor subtle like pistachio. It is not a colour that sparkles from a cocktail ring or from a slice in a highball glass. It speaks of crayons and grass lawns and lunchbox apples. It is green at its most blunt. Except in fashion, the green does have a name already. This is Bottega green – some call it Zoomer green to reference the generation who wear it. It’s the green that is everywhere, that lurid shade somewhere between a shamrock and a matcha latte, has for the past year been effectively owned by the Italian fashion label Bottega Veneta. When Bottega – first name only to all self-respecting fashionistas, no idea why – staged a show at Sadler’s Wells theatre in London, the stage was bathed in this green. Bottega has made the colour a signature, just as Hermès has with orange, and Tiffany with duck-egg blue. Such a hit is the colour that Bottega-the-green is now bigger than Bottega-the-brand. Yes, the handbags are divine, if you can afford them, but a granny smith apple is also a fashion status symbol in its own right. How did this green replace blush pink, which was the chic colour a year or two ago? Green snuck in as an accessory first. Because you know what works great with blush pink? Green. That is why a trailing ivy houseplant looks so good against your setting-plaster-coloured walls. Combine that with the fact green is more than a colour, being also a philosophy, a mindset, and the modern lens through which we look at everything from who to vote for to what to eat and what to wear. At a moment when sustainability is front and centre of every fashion conversation, it is only logical that the hottest dresses would be green. Fashion has begun to fluff out its feathers after the battering of the pandemic but is emerging with fewer airs and graces, humbled by the ease with which culture kicked dressing up into the long grass during lockdown. A down-to-earth green is where it’s at. Green is punchy but homely, and that makes it perfect for this year.There is another way of reading this colour, one that decodes it not via a Pantone chart but from the highway code. This is traffic light green, you see. A universal symbol, understood across ages and languages. It means that it is safe to proceed. After living life on pause for so long, the allure of a colour that gives us permission to pick up where we left off is strong. We want to wear green not because it makes us feel pretty or chic or elegant, but because it makes us feel safe. A green light for a safe future? A handbag doesn’t get much more aspirational than that.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Why zoomer green is the new millennial pink  | Jess Cartner-Morley,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/07/why-zoomer-green-is-the-new-millennial-pink
1/7/2022,"When 12-year-old Rose learned about the Bristol bus boycott in her history class, she felt an immense sense of pride. She knew there was a civil rights movement in the US, but wasn’t aware of the UK’s own struggle for racial justice. “I’ve felt quite proud that there were big stands here as well,” she says. Her schoolmate Ruqiiya, also 12, agrees and spoke of her frustration of initially struggling to find more information about the boycott online. They both love learning about it in class.  Both students attend Stoke Newington school in the east London borough of Hackney, which is leading a nationwide movement to reform their curriculum so it better reflects the achievements of black and minority ethnic people and addresses the legacy of colonialism. The diverse and anti-racist curriculum, titled the Diverse Curriculum – the Black Contribution, was developed by teachers and local council staff just over a year ago and provides students with nine new six-week lessons on subjects including the Windrush generation, diversity in science and activism. The free resource has proven successful, with more than 2,000 schools across the country signing up. Orlene Badu, from Hackney Education, who led the development of the project, said there is a misconception that decolonising school curriculums means taking subjects out or not sticking to the national curriculum. The programme from Hackney shows schools how to better utilise the curriculum to ensure what they teach is more reflective of the positive contributions of different communities. “Children for such a long time in this country have only learned about enslavement, and not about the black contribution. There is a positive contribution and it’s really important that everyone knows because it’s part of our national story,” Badu said. “I’ve had a lot of people saying in my class that they really like history. I think it’s underrated. It seems like a boring subject, but actually, if you’re learning about fun stuff like that, it’s really cool,” Rose said. Anntoinette Bramble, councillor, deputy mayor of Hackney, and cabinet member for education, young people and children’s social care, said it was important that the diverse curriculum was embedded across subjects and that they didn’t confine learning about black history to a single month. “So you’re constantly evoking, challenging but, ultimately, empowering young minds to think about how they reshape their future and the world that they go out into,” Bramble said. The groundswell of support for the curriculum across the country shows the desperate need for a resource such as this, Bramble said. She is keen to work closely with the national government to implement it on a national scale. The political will, however, is currently not there. The government’s Sewell report on Race and Ethnic Disparities in the UK pointed to “negative” demands to decolonise the curriculum – warning against “banning white authors” and “token expressions of Black achievement”. “This curriculum is empowering for children that are white, black and of all diverse backgrounds, because it’s part of British history. It’s telling some of those untold stories that weren’t told. It’s not to replace history, it is not to eradicate history, it’s to add to it,” Bramble said. “It builds tolerance, it builds understanding, it builds cohesion and it gives all children a new sense of identity of where we’ve come, but, more importantly, where we’re going.” The students appear to agree. “If you get taught things from a young age, they just kind of stick with you,” Ruqiiya said. “And if you teach the younger generation, then they’ll keep what you have taught them. And then they’ll go on to bring change.” Both students say it’s nice to see where movements and ideas, particularly ones they don’t agree with, originate from. They believe it’s vital to hold on to these “untold stories” as they grow up. “It’s kind of like a string that you connect. So that the history doesn’t just evaporate out of existence,” Ruqiiya said.",News/World news,‘I’ve felt quite proud’: the diverse curriculum inspiring school pupils,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/ive-felt-quite-proud-the-diverse-curriculum-inspiring-school-pupils
1/7/2022,"Ralph Hasenhüttl believes the Premier League should consider preventing January signings from featuring in matches rearranged from the past month. Southampton complained to the league about a perceived lack of transparency after their game last Sunday did not go ahead because of a combination of Covid cases and injuries in the Newcastle camp. Hasenhüttl said he raised the issue at the last Premier League managers’ meeting and has called for the league to consider banning signings from playing in rescheduled games to protect the division’s integrity. Newcastle, for example, completed the purcahse of Kieran Trippier on Friday and the defender would be eligible for the rearranged match at St Mary’s.  “It is for us the same,” Hasenhüttl said. “We can also now with our new owners sign three players and I don’t think it is really fair for them to play in games that have been postponed. I think the last word is not spoken so far. I was disappointed we could not play because we have been in good shape. We also had five cases of Covid. It is not long ago that we had to fill up our team with nine academy players and then we got a big defeat against Man United.” Southampton visit Swansea in the FA Cup on Saturday and take on Brentford in a rearranged league game on Tuesday. “I think it should maybe be something the Premier League is discussing,” Hasenhüttl said. “How many games have we had postponed? I think 16, 17 or 18 games so far. It is something that you cannot stop playing in December and wait for a signing in January to play. “Nobody did this but it could in the future be an opportunity. You shouldn’t get that … We could now sign four players and against Brentford we could play with a completely different squad.”",Sport/Football,Southampton’s Hasenhüttl wants new signings banned from rearranged games,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/southampton-hasenhuttl-ban-new-signings-from-rearranged-games-premier-league
1/7/2022,"Shell expects a significant boost in profits in its natural gas division, thanks to soaring prices, when it reports its latest results next month, as the oil and gas company said investors would benefit from the continuation “at pace” of its $7bn share buyback scheme this year. Shell, the world’s largest producer and trader of liquified natural gas, expects trading results at its integrated gas business in the fourth quarter to be “significantly higher” year on year as the rocketing price of gas outweighs a drop in production volume because of unplanned maintenance works.  Wholesale gas prices continue to break records, with energy suppliers warning of a “national crisis” that has already led to 27 suppliers going bust, and the prospect of bills increasing by more than 50% in April to about £2,000 a year. Shell, which will report its fourth-quarter results on 3 February, said it intends to pick up the pace of its $7bn (£5.1bn) share buyback scheme, which is being funded using the proceeds of the $9.5bn sale of its US Permian Basin shale oil assets to ConocoPhillips at the start of December. The company has already returned $1.5bn to investors and said on Friday the remaining $5.5bn “will be distributed in the form of share buybacks at pace”. The remaining $2.5bn from the sale is being used to strengthen Shell’s balance sheet. While Shell is benefiting from the energy crisis, last week the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, held emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, who are pushing for the government to intervene to alleviate the impact of soaring prices. Potential interventions being lobbied for include a windfall tax on major oil and gas companies such as Shell, as well as extending fuel grants, moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation and axing the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the EU. Later this month, Shell will move its headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK and scrap its dual share structure, after shareholders voted to back a proposal to simplify the Anglo-Dutch company’s operation.",News/Business,Shell benefits from energy crisis as soaring gas prices lift profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/shell-benefits-from-energy-crisis-as-soaring-gas-prices-lift-profits
1/7/2022,"Anew year, but hardly the fresh start that Italian football was hoping for. Serie A was supposed to return from its winter break with a full round of games on Thursday, but four out of 10 never took place. As Covid cases continue to rise across the country, local health authorities (known in Italy by the acronym ‘ASL’) intervened to block teams from attending fixtures. Bologna, Torino, Salernitana and Udinese were each ordered to quarantine following outbreaks in their respective squads. Their opponents – Inter, Atalanta, Venezia and Fiorentina – still each showed up to the relevant stadium and performed the surreal but increasingly familiar ritual of pretending to get ready for football matches that could not take place.  Juventus were the first team to go through this pandemic-era charade, after Napoli were barred from travelling to face them in October 2020. Since then, the story had been repeated for Lazio-Torino in March and Udinese-Salernitana in December. On each occasion, Serie A’s organisers declined requests to postpone. Last season, the league introduced a protocol which followed the guidelines set by Uefa – stating that teams were obliged to fulfil scheduled fixtures so long as they had at least 13 first-team players available for selection, including a goalkeeper. In theory, failing to play a match while meeting those criteria should lead to a forfeit. In practice, the sporting justice ruled the opposite for Juventus-Napoli and Lazio-Torino, ordering both games to be rescheduled after an appeals process – accepting the argument that clubs ought not to be punished for deferring to health authorities during a pandemic. There is growing frustration, however, at the inconsistency with which rules are applied by those authorities in different parts of Italy. Torino were ordered to stay home this week after eight Covid cases were confirmed among their first-team group – six players and two members of staff. Verona were allowed to travel to Spezia despite 10 individuals being ruled out by positive tests. And then there were Napoli – caught once more in an outbreak before their visit to Juventus. Mario Rui, Kevin Malcuit and the club’s manager, Luciano Spalletti, all tested positive on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the backup goalkeeper Alex Meret joined them, together with a further member of non-playing staff. The ASL for central Naples granted the rest of the team permission to travel. But then a further communication arrived from a different ASL, responsible for a northern section of the city where several players live. This one ruled that Piotr Zielinski, Amir Rrahmani and Stanislav Lobotka should go into immediate quarantine due to close contact with a positive case. The decision was based on new national legislation introduced at the end of last year, which imposed tighter restrictions on individuals who have not received a booster vaccination and are more than 120 days removed from their second jab. Napoli named all three players in their starting XI regardless, holding to a belief that the Italian Football Federation’s rules allowed them to do so. Quarantined footballers had previously been allowed to travel between their homes and work so long as they continued to test negative, but there is ambiguity about how such permissions interact with the new law. ⚽ @_OlivierGiroud_ + Messias + @RafaeLeao7 ⚽or@mmseize 🧤What's more entertaining to watch? 🍿🎥@skrill #MilanRoma #SempreMilan pic.twitter.com/MdZvzcoiCT In any case, they played, and it mattered. Napoli’s squad had been thinned out by the Africa Cup of Nations, with Kalidou Koulibaly, André Frank Zambo Anguissa and Adam Ounas all departing to represent their respective countries. Victor Osimhen missed out on the tournament but remains unavailable as he recovers from facial fractures and his own positive Covid test. Hirving Lozano was another coronavirus absentee and Fabián Ruiz was out injured. Juventus were missing players of their own – most notably the centre-back pairing of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci – but this still ought to have been an opportunity to claw back some ground in the race for a top-four spot. The Bianconeri played like it, too, in the opening minutes, throwing themselves into a high-tempo opening and almost scoring through a Weston McKennie header. It was not long, though, before familiar flaws began to show. This Juventus had plenty of energy – an improvement on some games before the winter break – but still no fluency. Like a New Year Resolutioner on a poorly planned health kick, they faltered at the first hint of resistance. Lorenzo Insigne chipped the ball into the area for Matteo Politano, who took a touch and laid the ball off for Dries Mertens with the outside of his boot. The Belgian crashed his finish into the bottom of the net. Napoli ought to have buried Juventus before the interval. Their 10 first-half shots were the most any away team has managed at the Allianz Stadium since 2013. Their lack of ruthlessness allowed Juventus a way back in, Federico Chiesa drilling home an equaliser at the start of the second half after Rrahmani could only head the ball down from a challenge with Álvaro Morata. The game finished 1-1: a better result for Napoli, in the context of both the standings and their injury list, but also a missed opportunity. Lobotka and Diego Demme had held the middle of the pitch throughout. Juventus will have their own regret at knowing they ought to have been able to do more. Even including the trio who were ordered to quarantine, Napoli still only had two senior players – Andrea Petagna and Eljif Elmas – left over to fill spots on the bench. Juventus flexed their depth in the second half with Paulo Dybala, Dejan Kulusevski, Moise Kean, Rodrigo Bentancur and Mattia De Sciglio all coming on and Arthur an unused sub. The real winners on Thursday, however, were Milan, who won 3-1 at home to Roma. Their squad, too, has been stretched thin, with Franck Kessié and Ismaël Bennacer playing in the Cup of Nations and the combination of Covid and injuries depriving them of three-quarters of a starting defence. A centre-back pairing of Matteo Gabbia and Pierre Kalulu looked like an open invitation for Tammy Abraham and the rest of the Giallorosso attack. Instead, Milan dominated the game, taking the lead with an Olivier Giroud penalty and extending it through Junior Messias. Abraham did pull a goal back before half-time but Rafael Leão came off the bench to make it 3-1 in the second half. The Rossoneri should have had a fourth, but Zlatan Ibrahimovic fluffed his lines from the penalty spot. Juventus 1-1 Napoli, Milan 3-1 Roma, Sassuolo 1-1 Genoa, Lazio 3-3 Empoli, Spezia 1-2 Verona, Sampdoria 1-2 Cagliari, Bologna - Inter, Atalanta - Torino, Salernitana - Venezia, Fiorentina - Udinese. The win allowed Milan to move back within a point of first-place Inter – pending resolution of their neighbours’ unplayed game against Bologna. Stefano Pioli deflected a question about his team’s Scudetto hopes afterward, saying: “Tests like this are important but only if we are capable of replicating them next Sunday. We have an objective in our heads which is to improve our points tally from last year and we have started well.” On a day when almost half the league was unable to even play a game, it could only feel like more of a relief to get 2021 off on the right foot.",Sport/Football,Milan the real winners in Serie A with fixture chaos and rivals’ draw | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/07/milan-the-real-winners-in-serie-a-with-fixture-chaos-and-rivals-draw
1/7/2022,"The attorney general has said she is “carefully considering” whether to refer the Colston statue case to the court of appeal after a jury cleared four protesters of criminal damage over the toppling of the monument. Suella Braverman announced she was contemplating what would be a highly unusual move after an outcry from Conservative MPs following the jury’s verdict on Wednesday. The former cabinet minister Robert Jenrick suggested the rule of law had been undermined, while Tom Hunt, a vice-chair of the parliamentary Common Sense Group, said he was “deeply concerned by the precedent set here”, despite jury decisions not setting legal precedents.  Writing on Twitter on Friday, Braverman said: “Trial by jury is an important guardian of liberty and must not be undermined. However, the decision in the Colston statue case is causing confusion. “Without affecting the result of this case, as attorney general, I am able to refer matters to the court of appeal so that senior judges have the opportunity to clarify the law for future cases. I am carefully considering whether to do so.” If the case does go to the court of appeal, the judges will not be able to rule on whether the jury’s decision was correct, only on whether there was an error in law in the directions that were given to the jury.

1/7/2022,"A new type of heat pump that may soon be rolled out in the UK could ease the shift for homes to low-carbon heating but is no quick fix, experts say. The Swedish company Vattenfall and the Dutch company Feenstra claim their new high-temperature heat pump, being launched in the Netherlands this year, could replace gas and oil boilers in UK homes without the need for added insulation or new radiators like other heat pumps.  The developers claim their product is not a “one-size-fits-all solution” for everywhere in the country, but it could be the most effective solution to low-carbon heating in rural and suburban areas. “The high-temperature heat pump solution is innovative, simple to install and could be the solution to help decarbonise homes in the UK that are heated using traditional gas boiler,” said Mark Anderson, the commercial and development director at Vattenfall Heat UK. Heat pumps work by taking heat from outside air and transferring it inside, but without making changes in a home most heat pumps cannot reach the same heat as the gas and oil boilers they would replace. Dustin Benton, policy director at the Green Alliance thinktank, said making these changes could be a barrier to some people shifting towards heat pumps and having innovations in the technology helps to make the market more viable. “The typical argument is to insulate your house but there are some properties where it’s difficult, because it’s old and expensive to do, or where people don’t want to for aesthetic reasons,” said Benton. “If you want to do the best thing for the planet, you should insulate your home and get a low-temperature heat pump but if you can’t do that, or don’t want to do that and want to go green, then you can go for high-temperature heat pumps.” The UK government has promoted the use of heat pumps, proposing that they lead a shift away from fossil fuel-based heating. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, promised in October to subsidise up to 90,000 homes to install heat pumps. But Insulate Britain has accused the government of ignoring the importance of insulating homes in their focus on heat pumps. “It makes no sense to believe that heat pumps, on their own, will solve the central issue of heating homes whilst reducing CO2 emissions,” said Tim Gough, a lecturer in architecture and Insulate Britain activist. “Deal with the fabric of the building to reduce CO2 emissions and heating bills by increasing insulation, improving windows, and reducing air infiltration from outside. Then you may well be in a position to reduce significantly the amount of heat needed for comfort and health.” Jerry Whiteley, technical manager at the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering, said new products claiming not to require insulation do not offer a quick fix because it will take time to train enough people to be able to install the heat pumps as most engineers are experienced with boilers. He also said it was important for these engineers, including newcomers retraining from other professions, to understand how the design of a heating system works and not simply the installation of a heat pump without considering other parts, including the insulation. “The more insulation you have in your property, the less heat you have to put in it. It doesn’t matter how high the heat pump works, you don’t want to be having to use that much heat,” he said. Stew Horne, the head of policy at the Energy Saving Trust, said both high- and low-temperature heat pumps needed to be considered, because emissions from heating and hot water needed to be cut by 95% to meet 2050 net zero targets. “It is a bold target that will require significant changes within the next 10 years. We need to become more energy efficient and support householders to retrofit their homes,” said Horne.",News/Environment,"New heat pump could ease UK shift to low-carbon homes, say developers",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/new-heat-pump-could-ease-uk-shift-to-low-carbon-homes-say-developers
1/7/2022,"After Scott Boland’s dream run at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, it seemed self-evident that things would never be that easy again. In his second bowling innings on debut, the Victorian seamer rolled in for four overs and picked up six wickets. Catches streamed into the cordon, he hit the stumps, he hit the pads, and he took a return catch himself. Another catch was dropped at gully. The longest he went without a wicket was five balls, and when it was done the whole enterprise had cost him seven runs. When he came on to bowl in his second match in Sydney, though, the dream continued. His first over was a maiden, and nearly had Zak Crawley playing on to his stumps. His second over kept Crawley guessing, hitting the seam with a perfect position that sometimes ducked away and sometimes in. The final ball of the over was a little fuller, carving back off the seam to hit the very top of off-stump. Perfection.  His third over was tight on the off-stump, keeping Joe Root quiet throughout, so that when Boland offered some width in his fourth over, England’s captain and best player chased it and edged to slip. Ben Stokes blocked out the rest of that over and another after lunch. Combined with Boland’s Melbourne outing, that made nine overs for eight wickets and seven runs. Eventually, perfection has to pass. It may even have been some sense of relief for Boland to return to cricketing normality after that, given the tiny abashed waves he gave to the crowd at fine leg every time he returned to their sonic embrace. Stokes scored a single in Boland’s sixth over of the innings, England’s first run in 70 balls. Soon afterwards Jonny Bairstow scored a brace, then in what seemed a minor miracle the batting pair scored three boundaries in the next four Boland overs. Coming down to earth happened literally in Boland’s 12th and final over of the day, when he lost his footing bowling the final ball of the second session and fell heavily on his side. In obvious discomfort, he left the field and was taken for a scan. Cleared of damage, he returned to the ground in his training kit to test himself out in the SCG nets, and was back fielding by the end of the day without being called upon to bowl. Ending the day sore with figures of two for 25 was more in keeping with reality. It was a similar story all round for Australia’s bowlers. Alongside Boland, they put on a show through a rain-shortened morning session that was no less torrid for its brevity. Cameron Green extracted alarming bounce, using it to discomfit Dawid Malan before making him fend a catch. Pat Cummins smashed a few gloves himself, and Mitchell Starc burned a full ball through Haseeb Hameed. Aside from reducing England to 36 for four, the innings also saw Australia drop three catches, have a wicket overturned for a no-ball, and have Stokes survive a ball from Green that smashed off-stump but didn’t disturb the bail. Far from being a source of frustration, these misses only reinforced the feeling that 10 wickets would fall in no time. It was a great surprise, then, when things stopped going Australia’s way. At Headingley in 2019 it was a counterattack from Stokes and Bairstow that changed the game. The version in Sydney will probably not lead to the same result, but it shifted the atmosphere, nonetheless. Nathan Lyon was targeted, the off-spinner conceding the second-fastest 50 runs of his career. Instead of settling into his rhythm he sometimes slipped too full or too short, as he was hit repeatedly to the fence or over it. Winning that battle was a big part of England adding 99 wicketless runs in a session. Suddenly there was a sense of enjoyment in England’s game that has been sorely missing this tour, and there was a sense of things not going Australia’s way. That course looked to have reversed abruptly when Lyon burrowed through the Stokes defence with a ball that skipped on, and when Cummins just about detached Bairstow’s thumb from his hand with the very next ball. But Bairstow got treatment, took stock, and carried on. A couple of Bairstow sixes followed soon afterwards, the wounded man swinging, including an audacious pull from Green.

He has now, by a most unlikely source. All of the sixes were hook shots, all with two catchers out in the deep. The first of them had Cummins laughing. By the third the humour had faded.
