1/28/2022,"Bodycam footage released through a Freedom of Information Act request shows federal contractors dropping off migrants at the Westchester County Airport in White Plains, N.Y., last summer, with one contractor on the scene saying the Biden administration was “betraying the American people.” New York Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino obtained the footage, a 51-minute clip from the body camera of Westchester Police Sgt. Michael Hamborsky on August 13, 2021. Astorino discussed the footage on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News on Wednesday. The Biden administration flew migrants from the southern border to the Westchester airport in the middle of the night from mid-August through October, the New York Post first reported last year. 🚨 🚨🚨Gov’t contractor talking about the secret midnight flights from southern border into Westchester (NY) Airport: “If it gets out… the government is betraying the American people.” Stop lying to us.

Some of the contractors were employees of MVM Inc., according to the Post, a firm that signed a contract with the federal government to transport illegal immigrants to locations throughout the country. “You’re on a secure facility here; we really don’t know anything and we’re in charge of security,” Hamborsky tells a contractor at one point. Hamborsky is able to learn that a plane with 142 migrants arrived at the airport at 11:48 p.m. on August 12. “Listen, my thing is I like to comply but technically we’re not supposed to show IDs or anything. Like I said, everything is supposed to be hush-hush,” one of the contractors tells Hamborsky at one point. “You want to try and be as down low as possible,” another contractor says. “A lot of this is just down-low stuff that we don’t tell people because what we don’t want to do is attract attention. We don’t want the media. Like we don’t even know where we’re going when they tell us.” Later on, Hambursky asks a third contractor why the operation is being conducted in high secrecy. “You know why. Because if this gets out, the government is betraying the American people,” the contractor replies. Border Patrol agents encountered over 2 million illegal immigrants at the southern border in 2021, likely the highest level in over 20 years. Over 38,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended during the 2020-2021 fiscal year.

1/28/2022,"On November 1, 2005, the United Nations General Assembly designated January 27 — the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau — as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Every year on this date, the UN urges everyone to honor the 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and the millions of other victims of Nazism. They also encourage states to develop educational programs to help prevent future genocides.  In honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day, we’re sharing one mom’s viral TikTok about a jelly company’s shocking connection to a Holocaust survivor. Join In The Know by Yahoo's Parenting Facebook group, where you can connect with other new parents, find trending content, product recommendations & more! Melinda Strauss is a mom and popular TikToker who documents her Orthodox Jewish family and way of life.  Check out these pro tips for party-planning on a budget on this episode of Getting Rich, sponsored by Acura In February 2021, Strauss went viral when she shared the fascinating story of Bonne Maman’s possible involvement in the Holocaust, according to a Twitter thread she came across. The Twitter thread, posted by professor Michael Perino, detailed his emotional encounter with a Holocaust survivor in the jelly aisle of a New Jersey supermarket. “At the supermarket today, I found a small, elderly woman standing in front of a high shelf holding @BonneMamanUS preserves. She was having trouble finding the flavor she wanted because the jars were set back on the shelf,” the Twitter thread read. “She couldn’t read the labels. She could barely reach them. I offered to help. After I handed her the raspberry preserves, she thanked me, paused, and then asked, ‘Do you know why I buy this brand?’ I laughed and replied, ‘Because it tastes good?'” the thread continued. “‘Yes, it tastes good.’ She paused again. ‘I am a Holocaust survivor… During the war, the family that owns the company hid my family in Paris. So now I always buy it. And whenever I go to the store, my grandkids remind me, ‘Bubbe, don’t forget to buy the jelly,'” the Twitter thread went on to say. Incident in a NJ Supermarket At the supermarket today, I found a small, elderly woman standing in front of a high shelf holding @BonneMamanUS preserves. She was having trouble finding the flavor she wanted because the jars were set back on the shelf. — Michael Perino (@ProfessorPerino) February 14, 2021 While Bonne Maman didn’t exist in an official capacity until after World War II, according to Snopes.com, the founders of the company can trace the history of their business back to the French village of Biars-sur-Cère. According to Holocaust survivor Eric Mayer, it was the village of Biars-sur-Cère that sheltered his family in 1941. “As Biars-sur-Cère had a population of fewer than 800 people during World War II, and, as this family-owned and operated its business during this time, the claim seems at least possible,” states Snopes.com. When asked to comment on the story, a spokesperson from Bonne Maman told Snopes, “Bonne Maman is privately owned by Andros, a family-owned French company located in Biars-sur-Cère, France. The family prefers to maintain privacy and does not comment on inquiries about personal matters.” Since the identity of the older woman in Perino’s story is unknown, and Bonne Maman has declined to corroborate any details, it’s impossible to verify the report. All the same, people all across the internet have been touched by Perino’s Tweets and Strauss’ TikTok videos — and might never look at their favorite jelly brand the same again. TikTokers were shocked that the seemingly ordinary jam company could have such a fascinating history. “My daughters make me buy it because it’s good, now I will buy it because it melts my heart,” one TikToker wrote. “That’s the only jam my husband and I buy. It’s the best quality, tastes great, and now I know it’s made with love,” another TikToker commented. “This is the jam I always buy. This is what makes it taste so good, there’s justice in every jar,” wrote another TikToker.

1/28/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden has decided against recommending COVID vaccines for kids aged 5-11, the Health Agency said on Thursday, arguing that the benefits did not outweigh the risks. ""With the knowledge we have today, with a low risk for serious disease for kids, we don't see any clear benefit with vaccinating them,"" Health Agency official Britta Bjorkholm told a news conference. She added that the decision could be revisited if the research changed or if a new variant changed the pandemic. Kids in high-risk groups can already get the vaccine. Sweden registered more than 40,000 new cases on Jan. 26, one of the highest daily numbers during the pandemic, despite limited testing. While the forth wave has seen daily infection records shattered, the healthcare is not under the same strain as during previous waves. On Thursday 101 patients with COVID required intensive care, well below the more than 400 patients during spring 2021. In total, nearly 16,000 people have died of COVID in Sweden since the pandemic started. Sweden's government on Wednesday extended restrictions, which included limited opening hours for restaurants and an attendance cap for indoor venues, for two weeks but said it hoped to remove them on Feb. 9.

1/28/2022,"Almost 30 years after providing testimony that brought the powerful Gambino crime family to its knees, notorious gangster Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano said he still has his regrets. ""Is there anything that I feel I regret and that I would do differently? Of course,"" Gravano told ABC News in a new special, ""Truth and Lies: The Last Gangster,"" airing Thursday. Despite a dramatic betrayal that turned Gravano against ""the family"" and brought down powerful Gambino boss John Gotti for good, no regret loomed as large as the ones about his real family, said Gravano. ""Being a gangster, actually in my life, was a curse,"" Gravano said, ""and it did affect my family."" Watch the full story TONIGHT at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. Gravano said he tried to keep his son Gerard and daughter Karen in the dark about his criminal activities, but the Cosa Nostra life touched them nonetheless. They described painful moments as children when they say they weren't aware their father was a gangster, even though it seemed like everyone else in the neighborhood knew. ""People expected me to be violent,"" Gerard Gravano said. ""People expected me to live up to my father's reputation."" MORE: Growing Up Gravano: Daughter of Gangster Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano Remembers Mob Perks When Gravano's financial success in the mob grew, the family moved from a working class neighborhood on Staten Island to ritzy Todt Hill -- an area populated by the children of doctors and lawyers. ""Then there's me, the gangster's daughter,"" Karen Gravano said. ""One of the kids told my brother that we weren't allowed to come in the house because of who my father was."" Hearing this, Gravano said he took matters into his own hands in the only way he knew how and walked down the block to confront the neighbor face to face. ""I said, 'Is your husband home? I'm Sammy the Bull. I'm the guy that your f------ kids are not allowed to play with,"" said Gravano. When the neighbor came to the door, Gravano confronted him. “[I said] ‘Bro, are you a good dad to your kids?... What if they didn’t have a dad? You think this is gonna end good for you?” said Gravano. “He was, I think, petrified. And it woke me up because I said, ‘What the f--- are you doing? They're legitimate people.’ And I left.” Following the confrontation, Gravano sold the Todt Hill house and headed back to his former neighborhood on Staten Island. Gravano said that he recognizes that despite his efforts to protect his children, they were still hurt by the mobster's life. ""I got to take that responsibility that it did trickle down. What I did hurt them,"" said Gravano. In 1992, Gravano, who was the underboss and known for his unrelenting ferocity in any fight, went from one of the most powerful figures in the New York mafia to its most infamous turncoat. He cooperated with the FBI and provided key testimony that helped finally convict Gotti, known as the ""The Teflon Don,"" of five murders, including the assassination of previous Gambino boss Paul Castellano. Gravano himself confessed to 19 murders, including the killings of his best friend, Louis Milito, and his brother-in-law, but served only five years in prison in exchange for his cooperation. MORE: Body of notorious gangster John Dillinger to be exhumed from Indianapolis cemetery  When asked about the Milito hit in a 1997 ABC interview with Diane Sawyer, Gravano admitted to feeling guilty. ""Oh, I absolutely felt something, tore me up. I knew the wife. I knew the children. It killed me inside,"" he said. But to this day, Gravano insists his crimes were just part of what mobsters called ""the life.""""It was ugly, but I know what people want me to say,"" Gravano said in 2021. ""It was so ugly. Would you change it? Yes, the way I feel now. But even looking now, I couldn't."" Gravano's former FBI handler, George Gabriel, said that Gravano's cooperation was crucial to law enforcement, and that his information led to the downfall of much more than just Gotti. ""Sammy helped me shut out the rest of the family and bosses and underbosses of the other families,"" Gabriel said. ""He arguably led to the demise of organized crime in New York."" But the families of Gravano's victims say that the deaths of their loved ones were overlooked in exchange for Gravano's testimony. Laura Garofalo's father, Eddie Garofalo, was killed in 1990 in a hit orchestrated by Gravano. She said despite his cooperation, justice was not done. ""It was shocking. It was absolutely shocking. People do more time for one murder. This is 19,"" said Garofalo. ""The feeling was us against the behemoth. What do we do? We have no recourse. They said this was OK. They wrapped him in the American flag and they sent him off,"" Garofalo added. In 1997, Gravano wrote a book with author Peter Maas titled ""Underboss."" Garofalo and her attorneys sued Gravano under the New York State ""Son of Sam"" law, named for the infamous 1970s serial killer, which prohibits a criminal from profiting off the publicity surrounding those crimes and allows their victims to attempt to seize any profits that might arise from things like book and movie deals. The namesake New York state law was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991 and was criticized for violating the First Amendment. By that time, Gravano had moved to Arizona after being released from prison and was collecting book royalties, when a similar Arizona restitution law stuck -- and Garofalo was able to collect.""We were vindicated,"" Garofalo said. Royalties from the book were seized by the state and distributed to families of Gravano's victims.Garofalo said the ruling gave her some semblance of peace. ""It empowered us to not be victims of Gravano,"" she said. ""We needed people to understand that while this guy is going to write a book and tell his story, the people that we lost mattered. They were someone's father or brother or son. My grandmother buried her child."" Garofalo feels her story serves as a warning about cooperation deals made with valuable informants who are nonetheless responsible for crimes of their own. ""If this could happen to us and the guy who killed 19 people was able to walk after a very few short years, it could happen to anybody,"" said Garofalo. Today, Gravano continues to tell his story publicly and appears to settle his scores in a new way. “Now look at Sammy the Bull Gravano, he has a podcast,” said Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa. “Instead of shooting at one another, they battle on podcasts. It's crazy.” Garofalo said she still questions if Gravano can ever be a changed man. ""He has this forum but what is the other side for him? Is he sorry? Is he remorseful?"" said Garofalo. ""Because I don't see that. He is still glorifying this life. When does he let it go?""

 President Biden is leading former President Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in two hypothetical, head-to-head match-ups for the 2024 presidential election, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by Marquette Law School, found that 43 percent of adults nationwide would support Biden if the 2024 presidential election were held today, while 33 percent would vote for Trump in a one-on-one match-up. Sixteen percent said they would choose a different candidate, while 6 percent said they would not vote. In a hypothetical race against DeSantis, however, Biden polls slightly worse: 41 percent of adults nationwide said they would throw their support behind Biden, while 33 percent would support DeSantis. Eighteen percent of respondents said they would vote for a different candidate, and 8 percent said they would not cast a ballot. Only 29 percent of those polled said they want to see Trump run for president again in 2024, while 71 percent said they did not want to see him seek a second term. The polling comes as tensions between Trump and DeSantis are stewing amid a possibility that the two GOP figures could face off against one another in a Republican primary to lead the ticket in 2024. Trump has been grumbling behind the scenes for months regarding DeSantis's rise in the party. Recent media reports have taken a microscope to the relationship between the two GOP leaders, one that has been characterized as confrontational and marked by private but personal attacks. The former president appeared to knock DeSantis earlier this month for refusing to disclose if he has received his COVID-19 booster shot. Trump, during an interview, criticized ""gutless"" politicians who will not reveal their booster shot status. Trump and DeSantis have not revealed if they will launch bids for the White House in 2024. Additionally, the Florida governor has refused to say publicly whether he will or will not challenge the former president should he wage a reelection campaign. A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll survey shared with The Hill earlier this week found that in a hypothetical eight-person GOP primary, Trump raked in 57 percent support followed by DeSantis at 11 percent and former Vice President Mike Pence at 11 percent. No other candidate in the poll pulled in double-digit support. Biden in December said he plans to run for reelection ""if I'm in good health."" A Wednesday poll from Politico and Morning Consult found that 45 percent of registered voters would support Biden if the election were held today, and 44 percent would support Trump, which would make for a tight rematch. Eleven percent said they would not vote. The Marquette Law School poll surveyed 1,000 adults nationwide from Jan. 10 to Jan. 21. The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
