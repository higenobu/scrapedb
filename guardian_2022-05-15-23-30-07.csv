5/15/2022,"Urgent legal action has been launched to halt the deportation to Jamaica of a man with such severe learning disabiilties that a judge found he would “struggle to survive” if sent back to the country of his birth. The 34-year-old needs support with basic tasks from his mother and his sister, and is a suspected victim of exploitation. The case has parallels with that of Osime Brown, the young autistic man who faced deportation to Jamaica but won the right to remain in the UK after legal intervention. He is among dozens facing deportation to Jamaica on a controversial Home Office flight on Wednesday 18 May. But lawyers lodged emergency legal action on his behalf on Friday evening, hoping to scupper his removal. The man currently facing deportation has one custodial sentence: he was convicted of possessing a loaded handgun with intent to endanger life in August 2014 and handed a seven-year sentence. However, he gave evidence saying he was “forced to own” the gun after being told to get into a car with three other men. The sentencing judge accepted he was not the ringleader in the crime and said he may have been “exploited by one other or others”. He has not committed any subsequent crimes. Numerous psychological and other assessments have identified that he has significant learning disabilities, struggles with reading and writing and is unable to live independently. He also has a congenital heart defect. A prison psychiatrist found that he was “easily led and vulnerable to exploitation”. The judge who ruled in his favour found he would “struggle to survive” in Jamaica due to his learning disabilities. “I am not satisfied he would be capable of living independently. His size and learning disabilities render him liable to bullying and abuse, he is a vulnerable person,” the judge added. His distraught mother is trying to get his deportation halted. She says her son calls her many times each day from the detention centre in a state of panic and confusion. “People would be shocked to know that human beings are being treated the way my son is being treated,” she said. “People with mental health problems need to be free; being in a detention centre will be very bad for him. He has always lived with me and is unable to live by himself. I feel like a fish out of water without him. Now he’s been detained I don’t even want to go into the kitchen to do any cooking because I always cooked everything for him.” She added that she believed he did not fully understand his predicament, and was struggling to eat regularly without her support. He was stressed and bewildered by his stay, she said, which was reminiscent of his prison sentence – which he struggled enormously throughout. Deportation flights to Jamaica are particularly controversial because some of those due to fly are Windrush descendants. Many have been here since childhood and no longer have links with the country of their birth. Numbers on the last four Jamaica deportation flights have decreased steadily – from 17 to 13 to seven and then four. The man is currently being held in an immigration removal centre and has said that if he was sent to Jamaica he would not be able to leave the airport because he would have nowhere to go. In the year ending September 2021, the number of forced removals were at a record low of 2,380, a 35% yearly drop. In 2004, the Home Office deported 21,425 people. But there are indications that the Home Office is trying to boost the amount now that pandemic travel restrictions have lifted, with offshoring to Rwanda and the first deportation charter flight to Iraq for many years taking place at the end of the month. Karen Doyle from Movement For Justice, which is campaigning against the deportations to Jamaica, said: “A judge rightly concluded that this man could not survive in Jamaica. Anyone spending 15 minutes with him could see that.” She added: “That the Home Office would relentlessly pursue this vulnerable man is testament to their cruelty. When Priti Patel talks about deporting ‘dangerous criminals’ we know there are people like Osime Brown, like this man and countless others just like them who go through this torture.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Under the UK Borders Act 2007, the government is obligated to seek to remove non-British citizens convicted of an offence in the United Kingdom and sentenced to 12 months or more imprisonment. Each case is considered on its individual merits and we will consider any evidence which suggests removal is not appropriate carefully before removal action is taken.”",News/Politics,Man with severe learning disabilities faces being deported to Jamaica,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/man-with-severe-learning-disabilities-faces-being-deported-to-jamaica
5/15/2022,"An 18-year-old white teenager opened fire at a Buffalo, New York supermarket on Saturday, killing 10 people and wounding three others in what authorities have described as a “hate crime and racially motivated violent extremism”. Eleven of the 13 victims were Black, and two were white. Authorities said that the shooter, who is white, drove to Tops Friendly Market around 2.30pm, “allegedly wearing tactical gear and armed with an assault weapon”. When the shooter arrived, he shot four people outside the grocery, three of whom died, local prosecutors said. He then entered the supermarket, where a security guard, who had recently retired from the Buffalo police department, tried to stop him. The guard died in the exchange, and the shooter shot eight additional people inside the store, six of whom died, authorities said. The attacker was arraigned on a first-degree murder charge hours later, authorities said. Here is what we know about the victims so far. Salter, a retired Buffalo police lieutenant, was working as a security guard at Tops on Saturday when the shooter entered the grocery. Salter shot at the shooter in an effort to stop him, but was fatally wounded, according to WHIO TV. “One of the individuals inside the store is a security guard, a beloved security guard, who is a retired Buffalo police officer – a hero in our eyes – he engaged the suspect and fired multiple shots,” Buffalo’s police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, reportedly said at a press conference. Salter was 55, WHIO said. The 86-year-old had just visited her husband at his nursing home when she decided to pick up food at Tops, WGRZ reported. Whitfield is the mother of Buffalo’s former fire commissioner, Garnell Whitfield. The Buffalo News identified one of the victims as Katherine Massey, reporting that a family member confirmed her death. She went to Tops to buy groceries, the newspaper reported. Massey’s sister, Barbara Massey, said in a text to a reporter: “She was a beautiful soul.” This is a developing story and will be updated accordingly.",News/News,Buffalo shooting: what we know about the victims so far,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/15/buffalo-shooting-what-we-know-about-the-victims
5/15/2022,"Even as she breezed past opponent after opponent while rarely coming close to even dropping a set, for much of her week in Rome Iga Swiatek was not entirely satisfied with her performances. She felt her level was too up-and-down, that she was still adjusting to the clay and still had not entirely imposed herself on opponents from start to finish. Although her standards are stratospheric, Swiatek is so good that she continues to match them. She produced another dominant performance on Sunday, dismantling Ons Jabeur 6-2, 6-2 to defend her title in Rome and extend her winning run to 28 successive matches, with five titles in a row. Swiatek had started the season with just three titles in her entire career, yet after four and a half months she heads to the French Open with eight and counting. She has dropped one set since March. This was a contest between the two outstanding performers on clay this season, with Jabeur herself compiling a career-best 11 consecutive wins as she unlocked yet another historic achievement by becoming the first Arab and North African player to win a WTA 1000 title last week in Madrid. While Jabeur has unsurprisingly been exhausted after the quick turnaround, she continually found a way through, recovering from a 1-6, 2-5 deficit against Maria Sakkari in the quarter-final and then saving a match point against Daria Kasatkina in her semi-final. Such is Swiatek’s level, however, that her opponents must be in pristine condition and at the height of their powers just to be competitive. Swiatek imposed herself immediately, smothering Jabeur with her ultra-aggressive return. She dominated on the baseline, obliterating forehand winners and easily dragging Jabeur off the court with angles while her defence was supreme. When Jabeur hit a purple patch and dragged herself back into the second set, Swiatek escaped four break points at 4-2 with a string of outlandish defensive points before sauntering to victory. Swiatek’s 28-match run began on 22 February and in the three months since the gap between herself and the field has only grown. The 2020 French Open champion will return to Paris as heavily favoured there as any women’s player has been in years.",Sport/Sport,Iga Swiatek dismantles Ons Jabeur in Italian Open final to extend winning run,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/15/iga-swiatek-ons-jabeur-novak-djokovic-stefanos-tsitsipas-italian-open-tennis
5/15/2022,"The year 2019 didn’t want for sparky essay collections that interrogated the female experience, with Rebecca Solnit, Jia Tolentino and Rachel Cusk all publishing new work. Even so, Emilie Pine’s bestselling Notes to Self stood out. Initially released by a small, independent Irish press before being scooped up by Hamish Hamilton, the Dublin academic’s mainstream debut brought unusual clarity and compassion to bear on sources of resonant personal pain including miscarriage, rape and life as the daughter of an alcoholic father. She follows it now with a first novel, Ruth & Pen, which taps that same likable combination of benevolence and searing inquiry as it sets the stories of its two title characters dancing around each other, drawing into their orbit questions of sexuality, self-worth and neurodiversity, as well as themes from the essays. Ruth is a 43-year-old therapist. With her marriage buckling beneath the weight of repeated IVF cycles, she suspects husband Aidan is about to leave her, and though her days are spent helping others parse their deepest responses, she’s yet to properly acknowledge the extent to which she feels “violated” by all that her body has endured in pursuit of a family. Meanwhile, 16-year-old Pen is on the spectrum, still adjusting to her parents’ divorce and trying to summon the courage to ask her best friend, Alice, out on a date. She has her own recent trauma to contend with, and is increasingly preoccupied by the climate emergency. Her overriding ambition is to be “normal”. The novel is set over the course of a single October day, during which its Dublin backdrop will host an Extinction Rebellion protest. It won’t be an ordinary day for either protagonist, and by nightfall, both will have faced up to their most anguished fears. Despite being separated by just two degrees, Ruth and Pen are unknown to each other. Their paths cross tantalisingly midway through the novel but what really binds them are their preoccupations – anxieties about their bodies and their value, about language and its limitations. Though decades apart in age, both are awakening to an urgent need to cut their own paths through the tangled terrain of love and desire. There is much to admire here. Crucially, in giving Pen a complex internal life that’s set on an equal footing with Ruth’s, Pine sidesteps many of the cliches that attend the representation of autistic characters in literature and film. “You can’t be autistic and average at the same time, you have to be gifted and interesting,” Pen observes, thereby demonstrating that she is at least incredibly shrewd. But if her viewpoint enables her to spot universal truths likely to elude the more neurotypical, she’s also just a teenage girl coming of age in uncertain times. It may not sound like it, but joy is a vital ingredient in Ruth & Pen. Sometimes, accessing it requires thinking back to the past or imagining a fanciful future; more often it’s to be found in life’s small, everyday details – a serendipitous painting or a pleasing idiom, a train pulling in to the platform so that the carriage door is exactly in front of you. These act as necessary reminders to Pine’s characters – one just making her way into womanhood, the other on the brink of middle age – not to abandon their own desires, however messy or conflicted they appear. That message is one of the most uplifting, lightly subversive rewards of this warm and deeply felt novel. Ruth & Pen by Emilie Pine is published by Hamish Hamilton (£14.99).

5/15/2022,"The days when Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney filled dancefloors and achieved crossover success with El Camino and Brothers seem a long time ago. Their recent albums have been solid enough affairs, full of skilfully delivered garage blues cuts that rarely disappoint. What has been lacking, however, is killer hooks that might appeal beyond their (admittedly substantial) fanbase. Dropout Boogie, despite an attempt to spice things up with some new collaborators (including Kings of Leon producer Angelo Petraglia), doesn’t buck that trend. Its first side certainly has its moments: there’s a pleasing swagger to opener Wild Child; Good Love benefits from the unmistakable guitar work of Billy F Gibbons, its downtempo, bluesy groove recalling ZZ Top’s exquisite I Need You Tonight. The tension of It Ain’t Over’s verse, meanwhile, is dispelled by a soaring chorus that sounds uncannily like ELO’s Showdown. Unfortunately, there is just as much pedestrian material that stubbornly fails to lodge in the memory. Particularly witless is Your Team Is Looking Good. Seemingly intended to be sung at sporting events, its inane lyrics (“Your team is looking good/ But not as good as ours”) make “You’re supposed to be at home” sound like something from the pen of Shelley.

5/15/2022,"The Liberal Democrats have already begun campaigning for the Tiverton and Honiton byelection before its date has even been set, Ed Davey has said, calling his party “an anti-Tory campaigning machine” which is key to removing Boris Johnson from power. Winning the Devon seat vacated by long-serving Tory Neil Parish, who resigned for watching pornography in the Commons, would be another huge coup for the Lib Dems. Davey said that, while taking the seat would be a huge task, the Lib Dems’ success in last year’s North Shropshire byelection – another rural seat formerly held by a disgraced Tory – showed it was possible. A further boost came in the local elections where, among the near-200 seats gained by the Lib Dems, they took control of Somerset council from the Conservatives, indicating the party is making a resurgence in its stronghold of south-west England. At the next general election, Davey said, the fact that his party is competitive in Conservative-held areas, many in the so-called blue wall of commuter belt seats, meant they would be at the centre of any electoral path which saw Johnson lose office. “I can’t remember a time when the Liberal Democrats were more important to getting the Tories out of power,” he said. “We’re on the march. We are scaling that blue wall. My sense is we’ve got real momentum now.” He added: “In the seats where we have a good chance of winning next time, they’re almost all held by the Tories. We are becoming an anti-Tory campaigning machine.” Tiverton and Honiton will be another major test. While the wins in North Shropshire and, earlier in 2021, Chesham and Amersham, have made the Lib Dems the immediate bookmakers’ favourites, they came a distant third in the seat in the last two general elections. Lib Dem activists are already in the constituency, knocking on doors, with Davey likely to join them this week. Campaigning will focus on ultra-local issues such as ambulance waiting times and GP numbers. “We’re definitely the challengers,” Davey said. “And after North Shropshire we’ve proved that in these sorts of rural communities we’re the ones people will turn to.” “But it’s a bigger mountain than North Shropshire, actually. It’s a tougher gig. We’ve got the Somerset result on our side, so we’re going to give it a good fight. But the Tories will know that we’re on their case,” he added. One advantage for Davey could be if, as he mooted last week, Parish stands as an independent candidate, thus splitting any Tory vote. An arguably even greater factor is the unspoken decision by Labour to most likely devote minimal resources to Tiverton, instead focusing on the upcoming Wakefield byelection, prompted after Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan was convicted of sexual assault. Davey dismisses the idea of a pact between his party and Labour, a theory already raised by the Conservatives. “It’s what I call rational behaviour. You don’t throw money or resources into seats where you’ve not got much chance of winning,” he said. “I certainly think that voters are very focused on getting rid of the Tories. They can just read the numbers. Increasingly, you knock on the doors of people who would otherwise vote Labour or Green and they’re saying, ‘Yes, of course we’re going to vote for you.’” The Lib Dems are also seeing increasing numbers of more liberal Conservatives turn to them, something Davey acknowledges comes from both his party’s efforts and, more significantly, an increasing distaste for Johnson, a sense fuelled by the mass of fines for illegal parties in Downing Street. “If I was the Tories, this is what I’d be most worried about,” Davey said. “The voters have just woken up. In North Shropshire and Somerset they didn’t need persuading. And I don’t think in Devon they’ll need persuading. They know that to get rid of the Tories, you get behind the Liberal Democrats.” Many such people, Davey says, are “embarrassed” to have Johnson as PM: “They’re patriots and they want their prime minister to be someone they can respect. “I’ve respected prime ministers of all political persuasions. I might disagree with them, but I didn’t think they were putting their own personal and party interest, always and everywhere, above the national interest. I think we have a prime minister who doesn’t care about the national interest. I think people are seeing through that, and they don’t like it.”",News/Politics,Lib Dems ‘already campaigning’ for Tiverton and Honiton byelection,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/lib-dems-already-campaigning-for-tiverton-and-honiton-byelection-neil-parish
5/15/2022,"Astronomy enthusiasts will be setting their alarms for the small hours of Monday morning to catch a glimpse of a dramatic super blood moon. The Earth will come between the sun and the moon just before dawn in western Europe, making the moon appear brick red as it falls into the Earth’s shadow. The effect is caused by the Earth’s atmosphere bending some of the sun’s light towards it. In most of North America and South America the lunar eclipse should be visible on Sunday evening if the sky is clear. This year’s only full lunar eclipse is happening during a super moon, when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth in its orbit, making it appear larger. In Britain the moon will be completely eclipsed from 4.29am in the south-west of the sky. Because it will be low and close to setting, it is best viewed from a high point or somewhere with a clear horizon, such as the coast. Dr Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, said the phenomenon was “relatively unusual” and recommended getting up to see it. “If people have a clear sky I would thoroughly recommend going out to look for it, even though it’s a completely inconvenient time of night because they can be really beautiful events,” he said. Massey is setting an alarm for 3am and plans to travel to the coast if the sky is clear. The last lunar eclipse with a supermoon that could have been visible from Britain was in 2019 but it was largely obscured by a cloudy night. With showers and thunder forecast for much of the UK overnight, there is a risk of the same problem this year. For those with a clear sky, the key will be finding somewhere with a south-west view of the horizon. Massey said: “You need to go somewhere where you’re not going to have that horizon cluttered by buildings and trees and so on. Because otherwise, particularly because it’s very low down, it will get harder and harder to see.” Many stronomers object to the term “blood moon” as it comes from an apocalyptic prophecy in the Bible. Massey said: “I think brick red and copper-coloured are much more accurate than blood-coloured, frankly. Unless your blood happens to glow, in which case, I think I’d recommend medical treatment.” The start of this week will bring the sorts of temperatures typically seen in the height of summer for much of Britain. On Tuesday parts of the south-east are predicted to see highs of 27 degrees, according to the Met Office. The warm spell will, however, be interspersed with showers which may dampen any heatwave. Met Office meteorologist, Sarah Kent said: “It’s going to be very showery at times, so it just really depends on how long the sun comes out for.”",News/Science,Blood moon: how to catch sight of dramatic eclipse in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/15/blood-moon-early-rise-blood-moon-lunar-eclipse
5/15/2022,"Wakefield’s Labour party executive has walked out of the final selection meeting for the party’s byelection, in protest at the candidate choice, which members termed a stitch-up by Labour HQ. In a rebellion by activists that could harm the party’s chances of taking the crucial West Yorkshire seat, the local party’s executive walked out en masse ahead of the vote on the final two shortlisted candidates. The vote was won by Simon Lightwood, a former staffer for the ex-Labour MP Mary Creagh. Labour is widely expected to take the seat in the byelection triggered by the resignation of Imran Ahmad Khan, the former Conservative MP who was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Regaining the seat would have major symbolic value for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, to show the party is making progress in “red wall” seats won by the Conservatives in 2019. The shortlist from Labour’s national executive committee excluded several local candidates, including the deputy leader of Wakefield council, Jack Hemingway. Members of the local executive argued the final shortlisted candidates did not have close connections to the region. Lightwood said he had lived and worked in the city for 10 years. “We have a lot to be proud of in Wakefield, and a huge amount of strength and resilience in our communities, but the Conservatives and their disgraced MP Imran Ahmad Khan have failed us,” he said. “Times are much tougher than they should be for hardworking people across our constituency. We are in a cost of living crisis, and in Wakefield, real wages will fall by £1,100 this year on average because of spiralling inflation. “It’s time we sent a clear message to Boris Johnson that enough is enough, because Wakefield and the country deserve so much better.” Voting continued after the walkout with around 120 local members – around a quarter of the total local membership. Sources in the room said the atmosphere had been “nasty”, with several officers appearing to be uneasy about the walkout. In a statement, the party’s executive said: “Today’s meeting should have had a good range of candidates to choose from, including quality Wakefield-based aspirants. Instead they had just two, with all the Wakefield options already stripped out. “We had a longstanding objective of an early selection – not least to avoid all the problems of a last-minute rush – and a local Wakefield candidate to meet the well-known aspirations of our communities.” The executive accused Labour’s NEC of having “dragged its heels till we’re up against the byelection” and said that the shortlist excluded all local candidates. “The executive committee – including all the officers bar one externally appointed individual – is resigning in consequence, and it will be for the full constituency general management committee to receive our resignations and take matters forward.”",News/Politics,Wakefield Labour chiefs walk out of final vote on byelection candidate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/wakefield-labour-party-walks-out-of-final-vote-on-bylection-candidate
5/15/2022,"They looked pale and exhausted as they waited for their cases – containing the few possessions they were able to pack into their car when they fled their home in Ukraine – at Luton irport’s baggage reclaim. But the smiles of relief beamed out when the family, mum, dad and their three children, stepped into arrivals hall to be greeted by a welcome banner, goody bags and the warm hugs of their host, retired teacher Cora Hall, who has opened up her Staffordshire home as part of a new refugee sponsorship programme. “I’m so full of emotions,” said the mother, Iryna, 34. “But most of all, I’m extremely happy to be here. Cora seems very kind and the children are pleased to be in Britain.” Her husband, Vladyslav, 37, kept the children, eight-year-old Hlib, Tymofii, 11, and Valeriia, 14, close and repeated one of the few English words he knew to anyone and everyone: “Thank-you.” The new end-to-end scheme – Communities for Ukraine – is based on a collaboration between two charities, Citizens UK and Ukrainian Sponsorship Pathway UK. USPUK, set up by lawyers and entrepreneurs, employs Ukrainian staff in Poland to support refugees exploring resettlement in the UK. Citizens UK, the community organising charity that helped pioneer the UK’s sponsorship scheme for Syrians, has recruited 20 civil society organisations with deep roots in their communities as strategic partners. Each partner – mainly faith groups and educational establishments – has committed to finding 50 hosts, and Citizens UK gives training to ensure that the matches are solid and sustainable. The scheme has been given recognised status by the UK but the ambition is to provide a safer, more streamlined, better supported system to the government’s much-criticised response tothe refugee crisis. On the evening before their departure for the UK, Vladyslav and Iryna, finished their packing at a refugee hostel in Kraków and spoke of their sadness at having to flee their home in the city of Pavlohrad, central east Ukraine, and their hopes for their life in the UK. “We couldn’t believe it when the war started,” said Vladyslav, who was a senior manager in a construction firm. “We knew our area would be one of the first to be affected.” At first they stayed put, heading into bitterly cold bomb shelters when the sirens sounded and the missiles hit. “They said that only strategic sites would be targeted,” said Iryna. “But there were rocket attacks in our neighbourhood that hit civilian areas. It was very, very scary. We felt we had to leave.” Vladyslav was allowed to accompany his family because he and his wife have three children so they packed a few belongings, into their car – with their pomeranian, and drove west, arriving in Poland three days later at the start of March. “We went to a refugee centre,” said Vladyslav. “They offered us accommodation for a month and said the war would be over and we’d be able to go back home.” It quickly became clear that there would be no quick end to the conflict. “We realised there are so many Ukrainian people in Poland thatthere was not going to be any opportunity to work and we were not going to be able to progress. We decided to apply to go to another country.” The family has been living in two small rooms. It has been cramped but they have been luckier than refugees living in tents in Kraków or in a disused shopping mall, where about 300 are living in a strip light illuminated limbo. Iryna said they were now desperate for the children to go to school. “They didn’t have proper schooling for two years because of Covid – and then war came.” The family has never left Ukraine before and had not flown until this weekend. In the days before they departed they were in touch with their host via email asking about subjects ranging from the weather and the cost of food to Vladyslav’s job prospects. He is desperately keen to work. “The UK feels like a dream country,” said Iryna, something you read about in books. We never imagined we’d go there.” They said a difficult goodbye to their dog, which is being cared for by relatives in Kraków, and to friends the children had made at the hostel. At Kraków airport, the family were waved off by Little Amal, the giant puppet of a Syrian girl created to draw attention to the plight of refugees, on to their flight funded by the Shapiro Foundation. Cora Hall, who was taking part in the Communities for Ukraine scheme through the Birmingham Catholic social care agency, Father Hudson’s Care, had borrowed a school minibus to take them from Luton to Staffordshire. “I’m excited and nervous,” she said after meeting the family. “I’d told myself not to hug them, to give them some space when they arrived but I couldn’t help myself when I saw them. It seemed the natural thing to do.” She has been researching schools, banks, the location of other Ukrainian families and has stocked up on the family’s favourite foods. She knows neighbours will descend with cakes and offers of help. “We can do this,” she said. “Together, we’ll make it work.”",News/World news,‘We’ll make it work’: UK community-led scheme offering hope to Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/communities-for-ukraine-refugees-home-uk
