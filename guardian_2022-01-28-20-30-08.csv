1/28/2022,"Good morning. The US and Germany have increased warnings to Russia that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline will not open if Moscow invades Ukraine, as efforts continue to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis.  The multibillion-dollar pipeline, which would more than double the supply of Russian natural gas to Germany, has been completed but it requires testing and regulatory approval. “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward,” said Victoria Nuland, the US undersecretary of state for political affairs. “I think the statements coming out of Berlin even today are very, very strong.” What is Russia asking for? It denies planning to invade but last month demanded a number of security guarantees. The main one, which was rejected, was that that Ukraine be indefinitely barred from joining Nato. What else has the US offered? Joe Biden told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, the US was considering offering economic support. It has provided $650m in military assistance in the past year. Could Nato troops be involved? Nato has put 8,500 troops on standby. There are more than 100,000 Russian soldiers at its border. The former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been spotted dining out on multiple occasions in New York, despite testing positive for Covid. The ex-Alaska governor, who is unvaccinated, was seen eating outdoors in the upper east-side restaurant Elio’s on Wednesday after a positive test, according to photos published by Mediaite. Palin, who confirmed her test on Monday, was also seen dining outdoors on Tuesday night at Campagnola, according to Gothamist. CDC guidelines state that people with Covid-19 should isolate for a minimum of five days to avoid infecting others. What has the reaction been? City officials have warned that she needs to “follow the rules just like everyone else”, saying she has shown “a complete disregard” for the safety of others. Three recent killings in Los Angeles have highlighted the way gun violence affects Black women and girls and the lack of coverage their stories receive. On 8 January, officials found the body of Tioni Theus, 16, on the 110 freeway. She had been shot. Two weeks later, sisters Breahna Stines, 20, and Marneysha Hamilton, 25, were among four people shot dead at Stines’s birthday party in Inglewood on 23 January. Neither case received much attention beyond local media. Authorities this week announced a $110,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in Theus’s case, an intervention her family and Black Los Angeles residents had been calling for weeks. How much have killings increased over the pandemic? Homicides rose by 30% between 2019 and 2020 in California and across the US, the biggest single-year increase in the 60 years the FBI has been tracking such data. In California, homicides of Black women nearly doubled in 2020. A total of 99 women were killed compared with 55 in 2019, according to FBI data analyzed for the Guardian. The death toll in Tropical Storm Ana has risen to 77 after three southern African countries were battered by torrential rain this week. Madagascar declared a state of national disaster on Thursday night as the toll climbed to 48. Mozambique reported 18 dead and Malawi 11. The death of a 37-year-old Polish woman on Tuesday, who was refused an abortion, has sparked protests against Poland’s restrictive abortion laws. Although her cause of death has not been confirmed by the hospital, the family of Agnieszka T suspect she died of sepsis and accuse the government of having “blood on its hands”. A convoy of truckers is heading from Vancouver to Ottawa to protest against Canadian vaccine requirements and other public health measures. Alongside support from Canadian conservatives, the group have received endorsements by Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk. The average American produces climate emissions 585 times higher than someone from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, analysis by the Center for Global Development (CGD) has found. The research, which underlines the “vast energy inequality” between rich and poor nations, was prompted after the “climate hypocrisy” of rich countries at Cop26 caught the attention of Euan Ritchie, a policy analyst at CGD Europe. Disney’s 60th animated feature film, Encanto, came out as the Omicron variant emerged, denting its box office success. But two months on, the animated movie, which is soundtracked by Lin-Manuel Miranda and is partly about the challenge of living up to family expectations, is having “a cultural moment and craze”. The movie has particularly resonated with Latinx audiences, with the producer, Yvett Merino, saying: “I heard how hard my parents worked to give us a better life. You hold that in you … I think that’s really part of what hits, what is connecting with people.” What with the pandemic and shipping crisis, many people have become resigned to occasional delays in getting their mail. Few expect to wait 51 years, though, as Genovefa Klonovska, a Lithuanian woman now in her 60s, did. The letter, from a pen pal in Poland she can no longer remember, was one of several to fall out of a ventilation shaft in an old post office over the summer. “It’s so good that the letter was inconsequential. The loss was not life-changing,” said Klonovska. “What if they delivered a lost letter from a suitor to his love, and their wedding never happened?” First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

1/28/2022,"Energy efficiency measures have already saved the average British household about £1,000 a year in energy bills, and further insulation and home improvements could halve future bills, analysis has shown. But the future savings are unlikely to be realised unless the government focuses swiftly on insulation, as the savings to date have come largely from efficiency improvements in electrical appliances and boilers, which will not be repeated.  The energy price cap is forecast to rise to £2,000 for a typical household in April, owing to the gas crisis, from about £1,300 today. But average household energy bills would be £3,000 a year if it were not for a range of regulatory measures that have brought down energy use in the last two decades, according to the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP), an analyst organisation. Jan Rosenow, director of European programmes at RAP, said the analysis showed the failures of the government in the past decade to take action that would have staved off much of the current energy price crisis. “If the government had acted, we could have had a properly funded programme that would have reduced greenhouse gases and energy bills,” he said. Electrical appliances such as lightbulbs, fridges and washing machines now use much less power than 20 years ago, owing to EU directives. A 2005 UK government regulation mandating the use of condensing boilers has brought down average gas use significantly. Energy consumption overall has declined by 16% since 2000 despite a 15% increase in the number of homes, the average home being 10% larger and the rise in appliance ownership, the RAP said. Insulation, double glazing and similar home upgrades have also somewhat reduced energy use, according to Rosenow, but by far less than could have been possible, as the UK has fallen behind on such improvements. Insulation rates have plummeted in the past decade, after successive government schemes have been scrapped and not replaced. At least 14m households have missed out on insulation because of the abandonment of the green deal scheme, which was set up in 2013 and abandoned in 2015, with only about 15,000 homes upgraded. A further 47,500 were improved in the most recent successor scheme, the green homes grant, instead of the 600,000 promised, when the scheme was scrapped after only six months. The “stop-start” nature of the government’s insulation efforts has also stifled the growth of the insulation industry, which requires skilled workers and a broad network of suppliers, Rosenow added. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the industry over the last decade. The RAP analysis suggested it would be a mistake to cut the energy company obligation (ECO), which the government is considering. The £1bn a year programme, the cost of which is added to energy bills, channels funding to insulation for people on low incomes. Cutting ECO “would slow down the much-needed transformation of our housing stock and leave more people exposed to rising energy prices in the future”, according to RAP. The RAP findings tally with separate estimates from Carbon Brief that cutting insulation programmes in the past 10 years has added about £1bn a year to the UK’s energy bills. Rosenow said the failure to keep up consistent action on insulation was a massive missed opportunity, but that action now could still reduce bills in future years. Some analysts have forecast high gas prices for at least the next two years, as the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and economic shocks. “Gas boilers are now about as efficient as they can be. The big area for improvement is insulation,” said Rosenow. “You can’t get to net zero without insulation. It’s impossible, it would be far too expensive and impractical.” Some Conservative MPs and rightwing commentators have argued that the net zero target should be reconsidered in light of the energy crisis, and have called for more oil and gas exploration. However, analysts have shown that renewable power has reduced the cost of electricity generation, and that overreliance on gas is the leading cause of high prices. “Green” Tories have also stepped up their defence of the net zero targets in recent days. Alok Sharma, president of the Cop26 climate summit, in a speech to the Chatham House thinktank said: “Clean is competitive, and the global race to supply the technologies and solutions a net-zero world needs is on. The train is pulling out of the station and countries and companies that want to remain competitive need to leap on now.” Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the Bright Blue thinktank: “People who are sceptical about net zero worry that it’s going to add to the cost of energy bills … [But] this is all about taking a lead, jobs and exports. We can steal a march on the world by learning how to decarbonise. For decarbonisation, we want to be the pilots, not the passengers.”",News/Environment,"Green energy measures saving households £1,000 a year – analysis",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/28/green-energy-measures-saving-households-money-analysis-shows
1/28/2022,"The attorney general is reviewing the sentence given to a man whose then girlfriend was left with catastrophic brain injuries when she fell out of a van travelling at 60mph after he kidnapped her. Angel Lynn, 19, has been left unable to walk or talk after she suffered a fractured skull and brain injuries when she fell from the vehicle on to a dual carriageway near Loughborough in September 2020.  Her then boyfriend, Chay Bowskill, 20, was sentenced to seven and a half years at a young offender institution on Wednesday after being found guilty of kidnapping, and coercive and controlling behaviour. He was also convicted of perverting the course of justice after he put pressure on his mother to withdraw her police statement. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, has received a complaint that the sentence is unduly lenient and will now examine the case before deciding whether to refer it to the court of appeal, which would then decide if it should be increased. CCTV footage played to jurors at Leicester crown court showed Bowskill grabbing Lynn as she walked away from him after an argument and bundling her into a silver transit van, which was being driven by his friend Rocco Sansome, 20. Bowskill was cleared of causing grievous bodily harm as the defence claimed Lynn jumped or accidentally fell on to the road, and the prosecution failed to prove she was pushed or thrown. During sentencing, Judge Timothy Spencer QC said Lynn “was belittled by [Bowskill] to a point she must have felt, on a regular basis, worthless”. “You bombarded her with repulsive, degrading messages, sometimes within a timespan of a few hours. You controlled her freedom of movement by a variety of means and she was not allowed any sort of life apart from you,” he said. He said she “would not have suffered those devastating injuries” had he not kidnapped her. Sansome was also found guilty of kidnap and sentenced to 21 months in a young offender institution. He was also disqualified from driving for 12 months after he was found to be over the drug-drive limit at the time of the offence. Police said Lynn was found lying seriously injured in the carriageway of the A6 near Loughborough, and remains in hospital requiring round-the-clock care for her injuries. Paddy Lynn, Angel’s father, said in a statement on behalf of the family that their lives “have been changed beyond recognition for ever”. “Angel was so full of life and had such a great future ahead of her. That future has sadly been taken away from her,” he said. “The catastrophic injuries Angel suffered will mean life will never be the same for her or our family. Every day is not only a huge struggle for Angel but also a huge struggle for our family and friends. We are lucky in some ways as we are a close family, we have lots of lovely friends who help us and people that care in other ways. “We don’t know what the future holds for our daughter but we try to put smiles on our faces each day but inside our hearts are bleeding out.” DCI Tony Yarwood, the senior investigating officer in the case, said: “Because of the extent of her injuries she now faces constant medical treatment and round the clock care. No verdict or subsequent sentence can make up for the quality of life this young woman has lost.”",News/UK news,"Attorney general to review sentence of man who kidnapped Angel Lynn, 19",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/attorney-general-to-review-sentence-of-man-who-kidnapped-angel-lynn-19
1/28/2022,"The first episode of Jackass is a seminal work of the 21st century. It is titled Poo Cocktail, and features in quick succession the early stunts, pranks and goofs that make up Jackass’s enduring DNA: the show’s breakout star Johnny Knoxville flies out of a cannon into a net; another of its regulars, Bam Margera, roly-polys down a hill through a group of nonplussed golfers while a cameraman giggles from inside a nearby bush; Ehren McGhehey, the most viscerally headlockable man ever committed to film, intercepts someone’s drive-thru order and throws it for a touchdown. Jason “Wee Man” Acuña, painted orange and dressed as an Oompa Loompa, skates down Venice Beach in a way that astonishes a bystander in wraparound shades. When Jackass first launched on MTV in October 2000, I was 13 and it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. Now I’m 34 and, well, there’s a bit in the first episode of Jackass where Knoxville knocks over someone’s drinking water with a fake erection while politely asking: “Where do you get sodas around here?” and it’s still the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. Its cast of daredevil idiots took vomiting, falling off things, and brief-but-agonising pain and made it into high art.  The initial run of Jackass was only three seasons and 25 episodes long, but created an outsized ripple. There were spin-off series, a Knoxville Rolling Stone cover, carnivalesque live tours, and a deluge of scare stories saying middle American teens had suffered harrowing injuries while trying to copy the show’s stunts. Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman wrote to MTV’s parent company Viacom urging it to take greater responsibility regarding its programming to help protect children. By the middle of the third season, red tape and cultural handwringing had taken much of the fun out of pushing a man in a shopping trolley down a hill, and Knoxville announced the series would be the last. Jackass, as a TV show, burned bright, then – infinite MTV repeats aside – faded away. “For the PTSD of filming to subside, it takes three years and eight months,” longtime Jackass director Jeff Tremaine says over Zoom, while Knoxville cackles wildly in a browser window beside him. After the conclusion of the TV series, the main cast reunited for the unofficial send-off, 2002’s Jackass: The Movie. Then, in 2006, Jackass Number Two. You get the feeling that the entire franchise hangs on whether Knoxville feels like it is a good idea to get hit by a bull this year or not, hence the gap until 2010’s Jackass 3D, which really felt like the last instalment. But then, 10 years later, the old itch came back. “Listen, it’s never not funny to see someone else get hit in the nuts,” Tremaine, who is 55, explains. “There’s a certain cultural moment with Jackass, and it went away for a few years, but TikTok’s got a big thing for physical comedy, YouTube’s all about elaborate pranks. It never goes away.” In the late 2010s Knoxville invited Tremaine for lunch. “He dropped about a 200-page document,” Tremaine says with a sigh. “We go: ‘Let’s just shoot for two days and just see if it feels right.’ Honestly, five minutes in, we were ready to commit to making a movie.” And lo, pandemic delays aside, Jackass Forever – film number four – is ready to drop. Jackass Forever arrives at a time when pandemic restrictions have been ladled on top of the usual health and safety precautions. Cast and crew had to break for seven months while Covid raged. On their return, they were summoned to a room to be talked through the latest safety protocols. Only underneath the table was a hyper-inflatable bouncy castle that promptly exploded. “It was an awkward position because you told us we need to take this seriously, but then you just exploded a bounce house on us,” Knoxville tells a giggling Tremaine. “Totally mixed messages.” Jackass has been swerving inelegantly around health and safety legislation since it began, but there was some arch irony to Covid being a defining safety factor in a film where a baseball gets pitched directly into someone’s nuts. “It’s funny to think about having all these safety protocols to go through just so we could do dangerous shit,” Knoxville explains. “It’s like, ‘OK, wear your mask until you get to the alligator pit and take it off and jump in.’” Knoxville is 50 now, and has allowed his natural grey to show: fellow Jackass lifers have similarly aged on screen (Steve-O, a gravel-voiced trained clown willing to staple any part of himself to anything, looks LA-healthy with perfect beaming veneers; Chris Pontius, the show’s go-to whenever a stunt involved cheerful nudity, is glossy and muscular like an elder but thoroughbred horse). There is a strange sense of mortality to Jackass now: when Steve-O talks of concussions, it’s with the tired experience of someone who has seen too many X-rays of his own head. But while seeing the players age might change the texture of Jackass, the flavour is still the same: there’s something soothing about knowing that, after 21 years, the core concept hasn’t evolved at all: it’s still just men with high pain tolerance getting hit in the balls and laughing about it. “From the beginning of time, you see someone walk and fall down, even the cavemen are going to laugh, you know?” Knoxville says. Tremaine jumps in: “But there’s such a genuine bond between all the guys that to me is so funny.” One stunt in the latest movie sees the Jackasses taken in pairs into a room they are led to believe has a rattlesnake in it, then the lights go out and we are plunged into night vision. “The funniest thing is listening to them deal with each other in just the most horrific situation,” Tremaine laughs. “They’re like old married couples, yelling at each other. It’s just so funny how ingrained those relationships are.” Anyone could have feasibly got famous by letting a snake attack their penis back in 2001. The appeal of Jackass was that the gang did it while so visibly being friends. Forever sees changes to the original cast. Ryan Dunn died in a car crash in 2011. Margera’s near-absence (he appears in a single stunt) is due to his firing over substance abuse problems (his subsequent legal case against Paramount further delayed the release of the film). And while celebrity cameos have always been part of the Jackass identity (Brad Pitt appeared in series three), they are even more numerous now: Forever is studded with gleeful extended appearances from stars who grew up laughing manically as teenagers at the show, such as Machine Gun Kelly and Odd Future’s Jasper Dolphin. They are joined by – gasp! – a woman, in the form of comedian Rachel Wolfson. “Yeah we just brought her in to meet her and she was so game, and so smart,” Knoxville says. “Her mother was the judge who put OJ away!” Is there anything from Jackass’s past that doesn’t make Tremaine and Knoxville laugh any more? The answer is “not really”, which goes some way to explaining its enduringly puerile appeal. “Not everything works, but by the time we’re shooting, there’s almost always something funny about what we’re shooting,” Jeff says. “The really gross stuff I don’t find quite so funny any more,” Knoxville – a man who once clambered into a week-old portable toilet to secure an MTV pilot – admits wearily. “That said, I think I turned in some ideas for this that were pretty gross.” Tremaine butts in with an oddly earnest compliment – “You’ve never been much of a poo poo guy” – and Knoxville blushes in faux humility. “Aw, shucks: you say the sweetest things, Jeff.” So, is this the last time we’ll see Jackass? The term “never say never” is uttered exactly once every 10 minutes over the course of our conversation. Knoxville did take an incredibly heavy knock from a bull in one of the film’s crowning stunts (he and Steve-O were fairly significantly hospitalised over the course of filming). “I got a really gnarly head injury at the end. So I had to get all kinds of tests; I had to see a neurologist and get all these treatments and whatnot. But I feel like a million lira now.” As Tremaine astutely noted, seeing someone else get hit in the balls is always going to be funny. Until it isn’t, you feel, we will always have some form of Jackass.

1/28/2022,"Six years ago it looked as if Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s footballing career was approaching the final whistle. After Sweden’s early exit from Euro 2016, the striker announced his retirement from international competition. At 34, he was getting on a bit for an elite athlete. Cut to November 2021 and, days after firing in a spectacular free-kick for his club, AC Milan, Sweden’s record goalscorer was helping keep alive his country’s hopes of making the next World Cup. The retirement chat was over. “I am trying to prove that 40 is just a number,” he said. Ibrahimovic had joined what feels like a growing club: the quadragenarian athlete holding back the clock. In an era of ever more punishing professional sport, these twilight stars seem to challenge notions that youth trumps all else. Members include American football superstar Tom Brady (44), the tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams (41, 40), Roger Federer (40), and Oksana Chusovitina (46), the eight-time Olympic gymnast from Uzbekistan.  There have, of course, always been athletic outliers. But is something else happening? Is it improved nutrition, technology or psychology? Or are sports stars just better at looking after themselves? What are the secrets of prolonged high performance – and what can everyday fortysomethings do to stay healthy during what can be an exhausting yet pivotal decade? I’m only six months younger than Ibrahimovic. I bounded through my 20s and early 30s without a care for much at all. I cycled, ran and swam. I now juggle work stress and two children under four. I ride when I can, a few times a week on a soulless indoor bike, but if I’m not at my desk, I’m picking up toys, food or wriggling humans off the floor. I have watched a slightly dodgy hip and back get worse. I can’t run, feel uncomfortable on the bike and take ibuprofen to help me sleep pain-free. I’m also increasingly aware of my own mortality, and have told myself that 2022 – when I hit 40 – is the year I’ll sort myself out. I suspect my heart and lungs are OK, but I feel I have the physique and flexibility of a much older man. I can hear things creaking. Let’s keep things depressing for a bit. Because 40 is not just a number. “People reach a peak in most sporting events in their mid-30s,” says Stephen Harridge, professor of human and applied physiology at King’s College London. Harridge, 56, a former 400-metre hurdles runner, specialises in ageing. You then enter a “progressive decline in performance” that remains steady until your 70s (don’t ask). Measuring this decline can be tricky. Maximum heart rates are an indicator (they fall). So are 100-metre sprint times in masters and senior races. “During the 40s we see about a 0.6-second decline in men’s and women’s times,” Harridge says. A combination of small changes, including drops in muscle mass, aerobic capacity and neuromuscular control – the way the brain conducts our muscles – add up to a drop in what is possible. In people like me, abused knees, creaky backs, feeble cores and neglected niggles can further limit performance. The elite twilight club has several advantages that make the difference. “The big one is what we call the physiological reserve,” says James Moore, a consultant physiotherapist and director of sport and exercise medicine at the CHHP sports clinic in central London. “They have built up a training history and an ability to listen to their bodies.” A wise head can also count. “We all love older players who can’t run as fast as they used to but have developed this incredible tactical sense, so they don’t have to run any more,” says Jeff Bercovici, author of Play On: How to Get Better With Age. See also: money. We’d all be a bit more supple if we could surround ourselves with physios, trainers, cooks and nannies. Moore, 47, had a call last summer from Andy Murray, who was trying to return to winning form after two hip operations. The Scottish tennis star’s joint woes are unusual for his age (he’s 34), but less so in Moore’s other patients, who tend to be 40-plus high-achievers. Moore reviewed Murray’s rehab and training regime to help him cope better with the inconsistent demands of tennis, where matches can go on for hours, and there may be little time to recover between rounds in a tournament. With older patients, says Moore, the challenge is getting a sense of their changing limits. Anyone, whether they’re heading to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup or KFC via a five-a-side pitch, must be smart enough to go easy – and do less – or risk an injury. Can’t match your 5km personal best from a decade ago, or lift the same in the gym? Don’t sweat it. “You have to park your ego at the door,” says Baz Moffat, former Team GB Olympic rower and co-founder of The Well, a women’s wellbeing advocacy group. Finding enjoyment in an activity is more important than what you do, as then you’ll keep at it. “Let’s not forget that the majority of people hate physical exercise,” says Alexei Sharp, 49, a former decathlete, at the FitFor gym and physiotherapy clinic in south-east London. Moore, who was head of performance for Team GB in Rio, says he has seen so many battered bodies that he can determine a patient’s problem within the first 10 minutes of a consultation. “I spend the rest of the time trying to work out a solution that fits their lifestyle and will motivate them,” he says. Enjoyment often comes from competitive sport that is fun and perhaps nostalgic – five-a-side or netball, perhaps. But if an hour of intense exercise falls between a day at a desk and a session in the pub, you’re asking for trouble. “Five-a-side is so jarring on joints and muscles,” Moore says. The key, he adds, is flushing the chemicals out of muscles that cause pain if left to linger. “Going for a five-minute jog after the match, then stretching, is way better than stretching or just going to the pub.” Cold water also helps this flushing process by stimulating blood flow, whether it’s an ice bath, ice packs or a cold shower. Moore says elite athletes increasingly drink sour cherry juice. It contains natural anti-inflammatories that reduce muscle pain and strength loss after exertion. When pain does stop play, switching to low-impact sports such as swimming and cycling can be good for the cardiovasuclar system. But the loss of impact can be detrimental. Studies have shown that cartilage, including in the knees, benefits from impact as repetitive squeezing and releasing draws in fluid rich in nutrients and oxygen. Bones need impact to stay strong; studies have shown that competitive cyclists have thinner and more fragile bones than comparable runners. “It’s always a good idea not to just do one type of exercise,” Harridge says. Lifting weights and more resistance-based cycling, such as up a steep hill, can provide some impact, he adds, but regular jogs that are short enough not to trigger niggles will reduce the chances of developing brittle bones later on. Variety also means working a bigger range of muscles. I have a cyclist’s legs but the core and upper body of a lame rabbit. It’s not just about being strong, but protecting joints and promoting balanced movement throughout the body; squats and lunges, for example, strengthen muscles around the knee. It may be significant that Ibrahimovic is trained in taekwondo. His Milan teammate Paolo Maldini, who retired at 40, is also a big tennis player (he made his professional debut in 2017, aged 49, losing in the first round of a doubles tournament in Milan). Sleep is often neglected as a factor in ageing. And in this demographic, stress that results from heightened work responsibility can collide with the demands of a young family. A vicious cycle can develop; discomfort further reduces the quantity and quality of sleep, sapping energy levels. Sleep loss also contributes to a weakened immune system, and an increased chance of developing depression, dementia, type 2 diabetes and heart problems. We also produce vital hormones while sleeping, including testosterone, which has a broad range of effects in men and women, including burning fat, building muscle and strengthening bone. In short, by improving my physical state, I’ll get better sleep, which will further improve my physical state. Beyond mixing a manageable level of impact with more cardiovascular workouts, and working on my sleep and warming-down habits, there is a growing array of devices, diets and obscure protocols that promise to mitigate the effects of age. “I call them the one-percenters that contribute around the margins,” Bercovici says. Yet some have been shown to be effective. Moore is keen on Kaatsu, a form of training in which bands that restrict blood flow to muscles stimulate their growth and function. Like cold water or ice, he says handheld massage guns can also help flush out muscles after exercise. I have been advised to consult a physiotherapist for my own ailments, and be wary of following, say, a random stretching routine on YouTube that may make things worse. Targeted pilates moves, Sharp says, are what I need to rebalance my body and reduce lower-back strain. Then I can get back to running and should become stronger on the bike. And I’ll be able to lift my kids without thinking twice. Because the good news is, while elite athletes have to eke out a few more years at the top after being used to supreme performance, it’s perfectly possible for amateurs to peak in their 40s. “You see a lot of people take up new sports then and find they’re on that rewarding part of the curve where they’re getting better and better,” says Bercovici. Perhaps Ibrahimovic will pivot to completing an iron man in a couple of years. Meanwhile, he’ll play football for as long as he can. “I don’t want to stop until I’m kicked out, well and truly finished,” he said of his heroic comeback for Sweden. Two weeks later, he admitted to a certain frailty in an interview with the Guardian: “Every day I wake up, I have pain everywhere,” he said.

1/28/2022,"Later this year the founder of the far-right Oath Keepers militia and nine alleged co-conspirators will be the first to face trial on seditious conspiracy charges related to the insurrection at the US Capitol.  The charges are significant because they allege that the January 6 attack went beyond disorderly conduct and assaults on law enforcement, instead constituting an organized and violent attempt to stop the democratic transfer of power. But because sedition charges so rarely go to trial, there isn’t a great deal of precedent for how such trials proceed, experts say. And US prosecutors have a checkered history in securing sedition convictions. “It’s been used in ways that have been absurd and has been used in ways that were slam dunks,” said Joshua Braver, an assistant professor of law at the University of Wisconsin. But unlike some previous uses of seditious conspiracy, many experts say the case against the Oath Keepers is strong. “This case is different. This case is a plan that was executed and the federal government is on much stronger grounds,” Braver said. “If anything is seditious conspiracy, this is it.” Seditious conspiracy is a broad statute that concerns attempts to overthrow the government, levy war against it or prevent, hinder or delay the execution of any law. It also can be applied in cases where suspects seize any government property and carries up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Partly because seditious conspiracy allegations carry so much political weight, prosecutors have generally been hesitant to bring such charges in the past. “Seditious conspiracy charges are rarely used in American jurisprudence,” said Jeffrey Ian Ross, a criminologist and expert on political crime at the University of Baltimore. Prosecutors can be wary of issuing such charges, even in cases that may fall under its broad statute, he added. The last successfully prosecuted seditious conspiracy case came in the mid-1990s, when authorities charged Islamist extremist Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine co-conspirators with seditious conspiracy. Prosecutors alleged that Abdel-Rahman and his followers plotted to bomb the United Nations, the FBI building and several other landmarks around New York City. During the trial, prosecutors presented the jury with speeches of Abdel-Rahman and a recording from an FBI informant in which Abdel-Rahman discussed attacking military installations. The defense, meanwhile, argued that Abdel-Rahman’s speech was constitutionally protected and that he never directly planned attacks. After a week of deliberation, jury members convicted the group of seditious conspiracy along with numerous other charges. Abdel-Rahman died in prison in 2017. Decades before the Abdel-Rahman trial, prosecutors secured a seditious conspiracy conviction against Puerto Rican nationalists who stormed the Capitol building. Puerto Rican independence activist Lolita Lebron and three accomplices entered the House floor and fired dozens of bullets around the chamber, wounding five legislators. The group, along with numerous people charged as co-conspirators, were convicted of seditious conspiracy and spent over two decades in jail until Jimmy Carter commuted their sentence in 1979. Other seditious conspiracy cases have fallen apart once they have gone to trial, including the most recent attempt at the charge in 2012. Prosecutors alleged that nine members of the Christian far-right Hutaree militia committed seditious conspiracy through a plot to kill a police officer and then attack their funeral in order to incite an uprising against the government. The defense successfully argued that militia members’ discussion of violent rebellion was essentially fantastical boasting, protected by the first amendment and that any specific plots were instigated by an FBI informant who had infiltrated the group. The militia members were ultimately acquitted of sedition, albeit with several pleading guilty to less severe weapons charges. A 1988 seditious conspiracy trial involving 13 white supremacists accused of plotting to overthrow the government and assassinate a federal judge provided an even more severe cautionary tale. Prosecutors in the case cut a plea deal with white supremacist leader Glenn Miller, who potentially faced decades in prison for other crimes, agreeing to reduce his charges in exchange for him testifying in the sedition trial. But Miller’s testimony turned out to be weak and unreliable, leading to an all-white jury acquitting all 13 white supremacists. The national chaplain of the Ku Klux Klan hugged several defendants following the verdict and touted it as a victory for white nationalism. In the years after the trial, Miller was released from prison and once again became active in the white supremacist movement despite being in the Federal witness protection program. In 2014, he killed three people, including a 14-year-old boy, at a Jewish community center and retirement home in Kansas. He died in prison last May. The case against Rhodes and the Oath Keepers is more straightforward than past seditious conspiracy charges against the far right, experts say, both because there appears to be extensive evidence of planning prior to the Capitol attack and because numerous members took tangible actions to breach the Capitol. Even Rhodes, who is not believed to have actually stormed the building, is alleged to have plotted to bring weapons to the area and coordinate militia movements. In the weeks before the insurrection, Rhodes allegedly purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of weapons and began communicating to other Oath Keepers in an encrypted group chat. “We aren’t getting through this without a civil war,” he messaged days after the presidential election. One Oath Keeper admitted as part of a plea deal last year that he brought an M4 rifle to a Comfort Inn hotel outside of the Capitol, while Rhodes and others allegedly discussed “quick reaction force” teams that could move into Washington DC with firearms. Once inside the Capitol, prosecutors state in their indictment that one group of Oath Keepers moved in a military “stack” formation and went in search of speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. The Oath Keepers “coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, DC, equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear, and were prepared to answer Rhodes’s call to take up arms”, the charging documents against Rhodes state. Rhodes this week pleaded not guilty to the charges and has repeatedly denied that he has done anything wrong or broken any laws. After federal agents used a warrant to seize his phone in May of last year, Rhodes stated that he sat for a nearly three-hour interview with authorities and claimed he had nothing to hide. He claims that Oath Keepers who entered the Capitol went “totally off mission” and that he was only there to prevent his militia members from getting into trouble. At a Texas rally in the months following the insurrection, he told a crowd that he may go to jail for “made-up crimes”. Rhodes was denied bail, in part because the federal judge overseeing his detention hearing stated that the militia leader had installed “elaborate escape tunnels” on his property and posed a flight risk. As one of the most prominent leaders in the far-right movement over the past decade, Rhodes’s trial is set to be the highest profile case so far in the investigation and one of the most significant domestic extremism cases in years. There are now over 700 people charged with crimes related to the insurrection, but the majority of those cases have involved less complex charges that don’t require proving the type of coordination and planning that seditious conspiracy indictments involve. Meanwhile, most of the over 150 people who have so far pleaded guilty in the investigation have received relatively short sentences or no jail time at all. “They’ve gone for the low hanging fruit first and things are going to get more interesting as the days go by,” Ross said.",News/US news,Seditious conspiracy is rarely proven.

It’s a laid-back plant and very easy to propagate, because its baby plants hang from long stems, so you can pull them off and plant them separately. The long, arching leaves come in two main types of variegation: “Vittatum” with central creamy-white stripes flanked by a band of green on each side, and its opposite, “Variegatum”, with green leaves and white margins. It’s non-toxic to cats and dogs. Light or shade?Bright, indirect light to partial shade.  Where should I put it?Hang from the ceiling or place on a high shelf in a sunny kitchen or bathroom, as they love humidity. How do I keep it alive?It’s a low-maintenance plant; the only common problem is the leaves drying out or going brown at the tips. Avoid this by keeping it out of strong, direct light, placing it in a humid environment, and making sure the soil doesn’t completely dry out.

1/28/2022,"Clarence Thomas, the hardline conservative supreme court justice, is facing calls for his recusal in the case over race-based affirmative action in college admissions that the court agreed to hear this week.  The case, which is being brought against Harvard and the University of North Carolina, is the latest potential conflict of interest involving Thomas and his wife Virginia Thomas. Ginni, as she is known, is a prominent rightwing activist who speaks out on a raft of issues that frequently come before the nation’s highest court. A one-person conservative powerhouse, she set up her own lobbying company Liberty Consulting in 2010. By her own description, she has “battled for conservative principles in Washington” for over 35 years. The challenge to the two universities’ race-conscious admissions policies is being brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). Its leader Edward Blum has been a relentless opponent of affirmative action and voting rights laws. His argument that race-based affirmative action is a quota system that discriminates against Asian students is framed with the supreme court’s newly-embolded rightwing majority in mind. A central player in that new six-justice conservative supermajority is Clarence Thomas, who is the longest-serving of the justices and at 73 will be the oldest once Stephen Breyer retires. Justice Thomas’s influence has soared in recent months with the rightward shift of the court following Donald Trump’s three nominations, to the extent that some pundits now dub him the unofficial chief justice of the court. SFFA’s lawsuit seeking to strike down affirmative action has received the enthusiastic backing of the conservative National Association of Scholars. It filed an amicus brief in support of the suit, accusing Harvard admissions officials of being prejudiced against Asian students and stereotyping them as “uninteresting, uncreative and one-dimensional”. Ginni Thomas sits on the advisory board of the National Association of Scholars. Observers are concerned that her position with a group that has intervened in the affirmative action case could present appearances of conflict of interest. Noah Bookbinder, president of the government ethics watchdog Crew, told the Guardian that while supreme court regulations may not legally require Thomas to recuse himself, there were serious questions to answer. “Ginni Thomas is an advisory board member of an organization that has taken a very specific position on a case in front of her husband. That will make it hard for the public to be confident that he’s going to be totally unbiased.” Bookbinder said that in the circumstances “the better course of action would be for him to recuse or for her to cease her involvement in that organization.” The potential appearance of a conflict of interest over the Harvard case was noted in a recent investigation by the New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer that takes a deep dive into the overlapping interests of the couple. The article chronicles in devastating detail the many instances where Ginni’s political activism appears to present problems for the image and integrity of the court. “Ginni Thomas has held so many leadership or advisory positions at conservative pressure groups that it’s hard to keep track of them,” Mayer concluded. “Many, if not all, of these groups have been involved in cases that have come before her husband.” In the most troubling recent instance, Ginni Thomas lent her voice to Trump’s big lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. She was vocal on the subject in the buildup to the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6 last year that led to the deaths of five people and left more than 100 police officers injured. On the morning of the January 6 itself, Mark Joseph Stern of Slate reported, Thomas posted on her Facebook page words of encouragement for the “Stop the Steal” marchers in Washington. “LOVE MAGA people!!!!”, she said., “GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING!” Soon after the insurrection, Thomas was forced to apologise to her husband’s former supreme court law clerks for comments she made privately to them that appeared to lament Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. The remarks were sent to a private email list called “Thomas Clerk World”. In the emails, disclosed by the Washington Post, she wrote: “Many of us are hurting, after leaving it all on the field, to preserve the best of this country. I feel I have failed my parents who did their best and taught me to work to preserve liberties.” An even more direct intervention in the politics surrounding Trump and the big lie was made last December when Thomas joined 62 other influential conservatives in signing an open letter to the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy. It urged him to expel the Congress members Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger from the Republican party. Their sin, the letter writers opined, was to serve on the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. They described the committee as an “overtly partisan political persecution that brings disrespect to our country’s rule of law [and] legal harassment to private citizens who have done nothing wrong”. Since the Capitol insurrection, the Department of Justice has arrested more than 725 defendants in relation to the storming of the building. Federal prosecutors have charged 225 with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers, including over 75 charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily harm to an officer. Last week the supreme court rejected attempts by Trump to block the January 6 committee from acquiring his White House records from the time of the attack. There was only one dissent from the bench to that 8-to-1 decision: it came from Clarence Thomas. “Ginni Thomas’s activities are unprecedented in supreme court history in terms of a spouse engaging in issues that are constantly before the court,” said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a non-partisan group which advocates supreme court reform. “The appearance of impropriety is in itself impropriety – all the supreme court has is the trust of the public, and once you chip away at that you are in trouble.” Roth added that Thomas’s comments in the days before January 6 were clearly problematic given her husband’s vote on the Trump documents. “It’s possible that the January 6 committee has emails between Ginni Thomas and administration officials from that day or the days leading up to it given how vocal she was. That’s definitely a place where Justice Thomas should have recused himself.” Should the rightwing majority around Thomas use its newfound muscle to ban affirmative action, as is widely predicted, it would mark the negation of more than 30 years of settled constitutional law on the matter. What lies ahead bears strong resemblance to Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that made abortion legal which the court is probably poised to weaken or even overturn outright. Mayer points out in the New Yorker that an amicus brief was filed in the supreme court case challenging Roe by Robert George who also sits on the advisory board of the National Association of Scholars alongside Ginni Thomas. Roth told the Guardian that a simpler solution to the full recusal of Clarence Thomas from the affirmative action case might exist. That would be to remove the National Association of Scholars’ amicus brief. “There is an easy way to deal with this perceived conflict of interest – strike the amicus brief,” he said. It is established practice in all federal appeals courts, though not in the supreme court, that amicus briefs brought by anybody with a connection to a judge hearing a case are routinely thrown out. The president of the National Association of Scholars, Peter Wood, told the Guardian that he knew of no conflict of interest relating to Thomas’s position on the advisory board. “Ms Thomas’s role is to provide advice to NAS in response to questions I put to her about NAS policy and initiatives. I have never discussed with her any NAS matter that was likely to come before the Supreme Court,” he said.",News/Law,Why Clarence Thomas faces calls to recuse himself from affirmative action case,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/28/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-affirmative-action-case-ginni-thomas
1/28/2022,"What is television? After watching Getting Curious With Jonathan Van Ness (Netflix), I don’t think I know any more. This series is a spin-off from the Queer Eye star’s podcast of the same name, in which Van Ness quite literally gets curious about a topic, then speaks to various guests about it. The podcast is long-running, well-established and very charming, but the question of whether it needed to become a more visual experience is yet to be answered. Van Ness is clearly a star. The former hairdresser made their name with the extremely funny Gay of Thrones online recaps, and went on to become part of the new Fab Five on the updated, much improved Queer Eye makeover series, which is always good for a cathartic cry and a renewed sense of faith in humanity. Van Ness is the one participants often open up to, usually while having their hair spritzed. Amiable, warm and an impressive interviewer, they give the impression of someone who genuinely wants to listen and learn. They are also excitable. All of this sets them up well to host an all-sorts, magazine show.  The first episode, Are Bugs Gorgeous or Gross? (we’ve all wondered), makes it seem as if the whole thing will play out like a high camp, low-budget take on The Green Planet. It sees Van Ness speak to a range of experts and entomologists about the importance of insects; if you can maintain a sturdy stomach while watching a termite queen do her thing you have more resilience than me. “That’s really cool,” coos Van Ness, though I’m not sure I believe them. It’s a high-octane mix of facts, footage and parody. Van Ness regularly pops up dressed as an angel or a devil, to declare that a bug is “Gorgeous!” or “Gross!” At one point, Drag Race star Monét X Change appears to co-host a spoof red carpet event, shouting about the “realness” of the bugs who are walking it. It is busy and discombobulating, but finds its voice pretty quickly. For all the fun snippets about insects and Van Ness’s willingness to get stuck in (he actually does get stuck in, when a chef serves him insects), it eventually swerves into a more nuanced zone – if you can call a choreographed dance routine about the cultural history of hairstyles featuring Angela Davis and Elizabeth I nuanced. The rest of the episodes are more suited to Van Ness’s open-hearted and zany approach to learning, with frank discussions on, officially, hair, snacks, the gender binary, skyscrapers and figure-skating. Below the surface, though, these end up as empathic explorations of identity. The episode about gender – Van Ness identifies as non-binary – features that rare thing, an onscreen discussion about non-binary people, between non-binary people, that is not adversarial. “Literally can’t talk,” Van Ness manages to say, clearly moved by the experience. There is much to recommend. Academics with unusual specialisms are great value on television, and seeing people’s unbridled dedication to wigs or spiders or 18th-century paintings is always entertaining. Van Ness is a delight to watch, so easy in conversation with strangers, and their wide-eyed enthusiasm is infectious. Their conversation with the congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, about Pressley’s relationship with her hair as a Black woman, and her experiences with alopecia, is unusually intimate for an interview with a politician. Perhaps a guest spot on Newsnight would not be a terrible idea. What’s curious, though, is that as a podcast, this format is fantastic, and if Van Ness released this show on YouTube, I would fully accept its giddy, scattergun energy. I watch Netflix on the same browser, and the same screen, but something about it here feels like a less easy fit. Does that mean this is television or not? I still don’t know. Maybe Van Ness can answer that one in another series.",Arts/Television & radio,Getting Curious With Jonathan Van Ness review – the most zany teacher you could wish for,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness-review-the-most-zany-teacher-you-could-wish-for
1/28/2022,"The death of an elderly couple, who drowned when their car was swept away in the river Trent after heavy rain last year, was accidental, a coroner has ruled. John Lillistone, 83, and his wife, Patricia, 82, could not be rescued when their car entered the water at Hoveringham in Nottinghamshire on 1 February last year.  Rescue teams could not retrieve the car for two weeks due to high water levels caused by weeks of heavy rain. Nottingham’s senior coroner, Mairin Casey, said the incident was “an exceptionally rare event” and ruled out any suggestion it was a deliberate act, the BBC reported. Witnesses said there was nothing they could do as the car left the car park and entered the water without stopping, before floating downstream and eventually disappearing underwater. One onlooker, John Chell, said: “It didn’t appear to slow down, there were no brake lights. I didn’t hear any shouting, no sound from the car. I thought that was really strange.” Michael Priestly, another witness, said: “Their demeanour seemed bizarre. They were just sat in the car facing forwards. Neither were shouting or trying to get out.” Casey said the couple’s reaction could be explained by shock. “This presentation I find is likely to have been explained by suddenly having entered the fast-flowing river and realising there was little or nothing they could do to ensure their return to safety,” she said. She added that John, the driver of the vehicle, may have miscalculated the speed and distance of the river. “It is often reaction times which slow with age and vulnerability to distractions”, which in this case could have been the fast-flowing water. Casey said there was nothing in the couple’s medical records to indicate any mental health or medical issues in relation to the accident. “When people take their lives in this age bracket, it’s very common they leave notes and settle their affairs. The evidence points entirely in the opposite direction,” she said. The inquest heard the couple, who were married for 60 years and had two children and four grandchildren, had started going for drives during the Covid lockdown as part of their daily routine. Additional signs have been placed in the area to warn drivers about high water levels, and a kerb is being installed between the car park and the grass verge leading to the river next month. The couple’s son, James Lillistone, said that while he welcomed the changes, he doubted whether they would have done anything to prevent his parents’ deaths. “They were just making the most of the end of the day and the nice weather and I’m not sure the signage would have made any difference to them,” he said.",News/UK news,River Trent: drowning of elderly couple in car ruled accidental,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/trent-elderly-couple-drowned-john-patricia-lillistone-accidental-coroner
1/28/2022,"The way culture works today, you will either know everything there is to know about West Elm Caleb or nothing. For the uninitiated, he is a 20-something New Yorker who works at a furniture store and gained online infamy for his poor dating behaviour. A group of women who had met Caleb via dating apps and then connected with each other on TikTok have accused him of ignoring messages, recycling lines, sleeping with one shortly before going on a date with another and sending unsolicited nudes. After 15m views of the #westelmcaleb hashtag on TikTok, the facts of the situation are unclear and the ethics murkier still. I do, however, feel qualified to comment on one element: Caleb’s seduction playlist on Spotify. One of the claims against Caleb was that he sent at least two women the same playlist, each believing it to have been personalised; it’s now being circulated to inform our collective arbitration of his conduct.  It is testament to the romantic power of music that this has been singled out as a transgression. It also demonstrates how, on dating apps, music taste has become one of the primary ways of signalling one’s suitability as a mate – and how, by reducing people to profiles of their likes and dislikes, this taste has been weaponised. The West Elm Caleb saga coincides with a competition from the dating app Bumble asking users to send a bespoke mixtape to a match, based on its survey that found that 59% of people believe music to be the most romantic way of expressing their feelings. Another survey last year by OkCupid found that there were almost 5m mentions of music on users’ dating profiles; 37% of daters surveyed said they would prefer their partner to be into music over movies, books or sports. A new dating app, POM (Power of Music), goes one further, claiming to pair users on the basis of their listening history. My own 15 years of dating can be sequenced into mix CDs and playlists, given and received; “exchanging favourite songs” registers between first and second base. Without music, I may not have ever had sex. As such I delved into Caleb’s tried-and-true playlist with interest – and trepidation. Would I fall for him, too? 😭 someone found west elm caleb’s playlist ✋ pic.twitter.com/q2AsqBhqOm No. It’s obvious from track three that this guy is trouble. Mazzy Pop’s best-known song by far, Fade Into You, is too obvious to be indicative of taste – and it’s too declarative of intention (“I want to hold the hand inside you”) to belong on Side A. It makes the case for Caleb as a common or garden “softboi”: the earnest young men on dating apps labouring to define themselves by their performed sensitivity and superior taste. (See the @beam_me_up_softboi account on Instagram, which documents the crude attempts at seduction or manipulation by men who believe themselves to be cultural iconoclasts for liking “alternative” music – like that little-known outfit Tame Impala.) Caleb’s playlist does include the softboi staples the Smiths, Ariel Pink and King Krule – but also more women and non-white, non-western musicians than one might expect of a dudebro out to maximise matches. This could equally mark Caleb out as somewhat attuned to racial and gender politics, or simply better at throwing his dates off the scent – testament to the funhouse mirror of modern dating. If we read too much into music taste, it’s probably because it is one of only a handful of data points we’re given to assess potential romantic compatibility. In the past, “Beatles or Stones?” and “Oasis v Blur” were icebreakers that you’d quickly move past if you fancied each other enough; on dating apps, they are the precursor to a conversation occurring at all. It brings to mind High Fidelity, specifically its protagonist’s dating dictum that “what really matters is what you like, not what you are like”; his eventual admission that it’s the other way round reflects an eventual maturity. Today dating apps conflate the two. OkCupid’s survey found that one in three singles believe musical preference to be a good indicator of intelligence. No wonder Caleb opted to hedge his bets. The overall impression from his playlist is of warm guitar tones and soulful vocalists: it communicates accessible, Pitchfork-friendly cool without saying much about sender or receiver, let alone who they are to each other. I showed it to my friend. “Wait,” she said, horror mounting, “I’ve dated this man.” (We checked; she hadn’t.) That pervasive universality speaks to the challenges of making a truly personalised playlist. There were unsettling similarities between Caleb’s and ones I’ve sent to love interests myself. Him: the Mark Ronson remix of Angel Olsen’s New Love Cassette, and the Magnetic Fields’ The Book of Love from 69 Love Songs. Me: the Chromeo remix of Green Light by Lorde, and the Magnetic Fields’ A Chicken With Its Head Cut Off from 69 Love Songs (“Eligible, not too stupid …”). I have even got in trouble for repurposing songs for new love interests. If you aren’t dating Caleb, it seems, you may be Caleb. But if it was as hard to make an original, effective mixtape as High Fidelity made out 27 years ago, it’s even harder now. Not only are you unconstrained by the runtime of a cassette or CD, you can pick from a library containing nearly every love song ever recorded – no wonder we end up picking from the same 69. Making a mixtape was “like writing a letter”, said High Fidelity’s Rob. Today creating a playlist can be like a social media status update: intended for an audience that is ambiguously defined and readily repurposed. Even those made with care and treasured as reminders of past relationships feel risky to revisit in such a connected ecosystem – I tend to switch to private listening, lest I be perceived from the “friend activity” panel to still be carrying a torch. If that sounds paranoid, one friend recently discovered that an ex-boyfriend was still adding to a playlist he had sent her, nearly six months after their last contact. (A recent addition: Jon Brion’s theme for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.) A mixtape’s lasting romantic charge came from the investment of time, the thought put into the sentiment: it was emotion trapped in amber. A playlist, however heartfelt, feels impermanent and less potent. As I wrote recently of Spotify’s personalised end-of-year roundup Wrapped, the fact that something as uncomplicated as bonding over music can be made so unsatisfying should be considered a platform failure. Indeed, algorithmic playlists (and the Spotify-friendly pop songs that open with the chorus) break Rob’s first mixtape rule: don’t give your listener what they want straight away – you remove the incentive to work for the good stuff. There are parallels here between streaming services and online dating. It’s no wonder that Caleb seems to have had such success operating at the intersection of both, pairing app-matches with playlists: they allow for endless easy introductions at the expense of serendipity and investment. See how POM, “the dating app for music lovers”, describes its approach to matchmaking: connecting users “based on their music history and emotional responses … to curate a perfect end-to-end dating and social experience”. Be still, my beating heart. I thought I’d found my own perfect music-history match on OkCupid the other day. He was wearing a Randy Newman T-shirt in his profile picture. I have a Randy Newman print framed in my hallway. Obviously, we were said to be 92% compatible. I got overexcited and sent him several messages in quick succession about Randy Newman, some in all caps. (“IS THAT RANDY NEWAMN?”) I assumed he would be excited as well, given that there are estimated to be around only 40,000 devoted fans of Randy Newman and most are middle-aged men. He never replied. I sent another message: “I cannot believe you would leave a Randy Newman fan with whom you are 92% compatible on read. What are your other messages like!!!” I was going for outrageous, alarming, courageous, charming. I may have just come across mad. But I like to think that, had we met at a bar or through a friend, we might have flirtily debated Good Old Boys versus Sail Away. Eventually I’d have shown him the print in my hallway; we might have played Love Story (You and Me) at our wedding as an excellent in-joke. As it is, we never made it past track one, side one.",Arts/Music,Personalised playlists have become the latest weapon in our online dating war | Elle Hunt,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/28/personalised-playlists-online-dating-west-elm-caleb
1/28/2022,"The New South Wales Liberal party has failed to resolve its preselection impasse for federal candidates and has delayed the issue until next week, dramatically raising the prospects that a federal intervention will be required. The 27-member state executive met on Friday night for less than two hours, but did not consider a controversial deal which was designed to placate the warring factions and settle a number of key seats by bypassing branch votes.  Instead factional organisers said the proposed peace deal, which requires 90% support to be accepted, would be put to the state executive during the week via an electronic ballot. This would give the factional leaders more time to either scrap unpopular parts of the deal or try to win support for it. In particular a proposal to put the former Young Liberal president, Alex Dore, into the seat of Hughes had riled local members, who were denied the right to participate in a preselection process for the third time running and did not want to see a person from outside the seat parachuted in. Dore is from Manly. There were also questions about whether the part of the deal relating to Dobell would stick, after one candidate had allegedly withdrawn. This could not be confirmed. The process for filling the third spot on the Senate ticket was also still causing angst. New rules for choosing candidates in NSW, championed by the right and former prime minister Tony Abbott, introduced a much greater level of grassroots democracy into the party. But the rules have led to some unexpected outcomes, including challenges to two ministers and bruising competitions in others. As a result the Liberal party has been without candidates in many key battleground seats. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The deal, hammered out by factional negotiators a week ago, involves avoiding rank and file votes in all seats held by federal MPs who are facing challenges. That means the MP Trent Zimmerman would be re-endorsed for North Sydney; the environment minister, Sussan Ley, would survive a challenge in the southern NSW seat of Farrer; and the immigration minister and centre right faction heavyweight, Alex Hawke, would remain as the Liberal candidate in Mitchell. Some branch preselections would proceed – Bennelong, Warringah and Parramatta – but in these cases the outcomes are more certain.

There are also internal frictions over the NSW Senate ticket, with a proposal to automatically endorse the foreign minister, Marise Payne, as top of the ticket, but the next Liberal spot, No 3, would go to a ballot. This would likely see two current senators, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells and Jim Molan, face off for the winnable spot.

The dancer is not entirely alone on stage. There’s percussionist Loïc Schild conjuring gentle tremolos and ominous rumbles, and there’s the set, designed by Bory, which is a character in its own right.  A vast sheet of thick metallic paper hangs behind Shivalingappa, the scene coloured a shadowy bronze. The paper begins to ripple and billow, launching forward like a giant beast or wave, threatening to engulf her. Yet it’s entirely possible to believe that Shivalingappa is silently controlling the forces around her. The sheet becomes an instrument, Schild rhythmically rapping his fingers on it; it’s also a cocoon and a canvas, where Shivalingappa draws circles with what’s essentially a giant pastry brush and then scatters ash across the surface, tracing rings in the dust with her feet. An image is slowly revealed, like a rising sun or a powerful vortex, something mighty and beautiful. aSH is a story of constant transformation and renewal, of destruction and creation, of life’s circularity, and there’s Shivalingappa, without forceful presence or exertion, at the core of all this visual wonder.

1/28/2022,"Invasive king crabs have made their way to British shores, sparking fears that local brown crab and scallop populations could be decimated. This week, fishers in North Yorkshire found their pots heavy not with brown crab, but with the bright-red invader with long, spindly legs prized for their sweet flesh. London restaurants have already snapped up the haul, ready for weekend menus.  The fishers were shocked – bar rumours of one or two pulled up over the last couple of years, these crabs had never been seen off British shores. The species, native to North America, was introduced to Russia in the 1960s by scientists who wanted to establish a new, lucrative fishery. Thriving in cold seas, the crab population exploded, and they travelled to Norway, where they caused a fishing industry boom. And now they seem to have travelled all the way to Britain. Fishers in the UK are tentatively excited, as many fisheries in Norway became rich off the invasive species, though environmentalists are alarmed about the potential impact on native species. Shaun Henderson is a fish supplier who sells to more than 80 London restaurants. He said one of his fishers pulled up 250kg of king crabs. He said: “My cousin is a fisherman. He’d been working on the boat for 15 or 20 years, and my dad was a fisherman and he was working on crabbing boats before that. None of them have ever caught a king crab before. It was quite funny to see them appear in our waters now. “I’m excited about it but they seem like quite an invasive species, so I feel wary. They seem to be eating up the scallops at the bottom and they could outcompete brown crabs. I am a bit worried about our native seafood.” His cousin was fishing in the North Sea off Bridlington when he pulled up the crabs. Henderson said: “They destroyed quite a lot of the fishing in Norway but obviously made a lot of people in Norway a lot of money as well because fishermen were quite happy that they were catching these different, more expensive, lucrative fish.” Will Murray, head chef at Fallow restaurant in St James’ Market, London, has bought up some of the haul. He said he planned to cook the crabs over charcoal and make a sauce with the meat from the head. The sauce will be poured over potatoes boulangère and the legs served alongside. “We are excited, but a bit terrified, as they really are invaders and could kill off all our brown crabs,” Murray said. “This could be the next grey squirrel, the next Japanese knotweed – but at least these are easy to cook and enjoyable to eat. This is some of the best seafood in the world, a real premium ingredient.” However, despite their delicious taste, he said the crabs did not bode well for the rest of his menu. The chef said it could be good for British fishers “if we react the right way and if we can export the commodity, but at the same time it’s bittersweet as it ultimately means that native populations are going to suffer. “They breed in a layer on the seafloor and can grow to a massive size. The potters are already getting bigger pots to fit these bigger crabs in. You can see from reports from the fishermen that the population has just exploded.”",News/Environment,King crabs invade UK waters threatening native species,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/28/king-crabs-invade-uk-waters-threatening-native-species
1/28/2022,"A convoy of truckers and their supporters is set to converge on the Canadian capital in a protest which has spiralled from frustrations over vaccine requirements into calls for the repeal of all public health measures – and even the overthrow of the federal government. Ahead of Saturday’s protest in Ottawa, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, dismissed the group as a “small fringe” that held “unacceptable views” and didn’t reflect the majority of Canadians.  Earlier this month, Canada began requiring any truckers arriving from the US be fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Those who are not vaccinated – who are believed to constitute less than 15% the country’s drivers – are required to quarantine for 14 days. Canada has recorded 2.93 million Covid cases and 32,600 deaths from the virus. The convoy, which left Vancouver on earlier this week, has more than 275,000 supporters on Facebook, nearly 40,000 supports on the encrypted messaging app Telegram and has raised C$5.5m from 70,000 donations on GoFundMe. GoFundMe announced earlier this week it had frozen the funds until it could determine with the organizers how the money would be dispersed. One former intelligence analyst said the “speed and anonymity” of the donations has raised red flags. “It’s not really not clear to me how many of those supporters donating online are actually even Canadian. A lot of the donations have been made anonymously and there’s very clearly some activity from foreign countries,” said Jessica Davis, a former intelligence analyst for the Canadian government and head of Insight Threat Intelligence. “It’s really difficult to get a sense for how many Canadians actually support this versus how many people globally are trying to oppose vaccine mandates and the associated political objectives,” said Davis. The convoy highlights the way in which public health measures such as vaccine mandates have become increasingly tied to political divisions. One of the main groups behind the protest is Canada Unity which has opposed what it says are “unconstitutional” Covid rules. The group recently posted a “memorandum of understanding” to its website, saying that members plan to present to politicians on Parliament Hill. The group claims that the leader of the senate and the governor general will sign the document to create a governing committee, which they claim would work to revoke the vaccine mandate. “This document is largely incomprehensible and is completely divorced from our political reality,” said Davis. Despite such fringe ideas, which have prompted comparisons to the January 6th insurrection in the United States, the convoy has received endorsements from federal Conservative politicians, including former leader Andrew Scheer and deputy leader Candice Bergen, who called for peaceful protest. Conservative leader Erin O’Toole, who has expressed wariness to vaccine mandates in the past, said on Thursday he would meet with the truckers. But the group have received endorsements by Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk. The son of the former US president posted a video on social media supporting the truckers for “fighting against medical discrimination”, while the tech billionaire on Thursday tweeted: “Canadian truckers rule.” Some Canadian conservatives have spoken out against the mandate, arguing it places a burden on truckers when supply chains are already strained. Some have posted pictures of empty grocery store shelves. But experts caution that the vaccine mandate is just one part of a “perfect storm” to hit the nation’s food system. Poor weather, highway closures and staffing challenges at grocery stores have also made it difficult to get food on shelves. “The supply chain is flexible, but it’s also fragile,” said Simon Somogyi, a professor at the University of Guelph who studies the food business and supply chain management. “The Canadian food system really rides on the back of a truck because of our short growing season,” he said of the C$21bn worth of food from the US each year and trucks play a key role in moving it. In many way, Covid-19 has exposed both the necessity of the trucking system as well as headwinds within the system, including a shortage of drivers. “At the end of the day, we need more trucks on the road. If everyone came to the table for an honest discussion about this, rather than making political statements, it’d be better for everyone.”",News/World news, Canada truckers’ vaccine protest spirals into calls to repeal all public health rules,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/canada-truckers-covid-vaccine-mandate-protest-government
1/28/2022,"The messed up psychology of Batman, masked defender of Gotham City, is so dense and peculiar that entire books have been written about it. This is perhaps why so many fans took umbrage at the caped crusader’s depiction during the Joel Schumacher years as a batnippled lightweight. There is really nothing fun about getting under the skin of the dark knight, only to discover he has all the psychological complexity of a Ken doll, as George Clooney and Val Kilmer should probably have worked out the minute they picked up their scripts. Nobody can accuse Robert Pattinson of not doing his homework in this regard. Speaking in the new issue of Premiere magazine’s French edition, the new Batman reveals that he wanted to get into the nitty-gritty of the superhero’s psyche from the minute he signed on.  “There is this rule with Batman: he must not kill,” said Pattinson. “It can be interpreted in two ways. Either he only wants to inflict the appropriate punishment, or he wants to kill and his self-control prevents him from doing so.” “I imagined it that way from the rehearsal of the first fight, I thought it was funnier: something in him just wanted to slit the guy’s throat! I told myself that if he spends his nights chasing criminals, it is impossible that he does not take pleasure in it. He suffers and it is a desire that overwhelms him. And by dint of knocking, his mind clears, he calms down, he reaches a state close to plenitude. I’m sure in this first fight, he manages to convince himself that every guy in front of him is the one who killed his mother [laughs]. And so that allows him to vent all his rage. “The interesting thing is that this Batman practically lives in the gutter. He’s nowhere at home except on the street when he’s wearing the suit. He lives a criminal life, but without committing crimes! I felt like I could get something out of that. Anyway, I could only play a superhero if he was really dirty!” It’s a fascinatingly grimy take that might give us some insight into how Pattinson’s interpretation of the character, soon to be seen in Matt Reeves’ The Batman, might vary from previous big screen caped crusaders. Both the Christian Bale and Michael Keaton versions stood out for being noble and reserved, bound to their duty to defend Gotham against criminals and supervillains alike. There was rarely any suggestion that they took pleasure in inflicting pain on their victims. Ben Affleck’s take came across very differently, as a pugnacious, brutal bully willing to use guns and heavy weaponry to take down anyone who got in his way – at least in the knuckle-headed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Pattinson’s comments have sparked a debate among fans over Batman’s moral grounding, or lack of it. But intriguingly (perhaps despairingly), the focus has been on whether the caped crusader should kill (in the comics, our hero rarely murders anybody) rather than the more interesting detail. The suggestion from meatheaded corners of the DC fanbase is that Batfleck would never have had such moral complexities, which is, of course, entirely correct. This is also the reason why many fans did not warm to Affleck’s take, and why sequel Justice League ended up being written in such a way as to represent a two-hour long grovelling apology for messing up the character. Affleck spends pretty much the entire movie – I am talking the weaker original Joss Whedon version here – saying sorry for being a jerk and “killing” Superman. Imagine being mad Pattinson’s Batman doesn’t kill. Yes, Batman has killed in movies before, as he did in the early comics, and sometimes there’s been thematic weight to it, but he’s had that rule since 1940. Idk y’all, kinda weird to see folks passionately want Batman to murder. It strikes me that everyone is missing a trick here. Surely the fascinating aspect of this new Batman is that he will restrain himself from killing his victims, even though he would actually quite like to splay them out like a raw chicken. Pattinson is pitching an anguished, cut-throat, vagabond caped crusader whose natural instincts are for cruel and murderous carnage, but who is restrained by a devastatingly rigid moral code. It makes me, finally, hopeful that Reeves’ itineration of Gotham City’s heroic defender will have something to say for itself beyond a shallow retread of the Batman mythos. It also makes me wonder if this might be one Batman movie to skip taking the kids to see. Here we are into the superhero’s ninth decade and maybe, just maybe (on the big screen at least) the dark knight is finally about to start living up to his nickname.",Arts/Film,Robert Pattinson’s Batman is going to be seriously messed up – and I like it,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/28/robert-pattinsons-batman-is-going-to-be-seriously-messed-up-and-i-like-it
1/28/2022,"I look back on the first lockdown with a kind of fondness. Despite the turmoil of the pandemic, my partner and I were lucky to have a space to ourselves, which we made as homely as possible in the circumstances. We got a rare glimpse into each other’s professional selves and spent barely a minute apart, which was in stark contrast to our Before Lives, when whole weeks would pass without even a proper kiss. Ricocheting between lockdown boredom and dread, often within the hour, sex took on renewed importance for us. Making one another impromptu stovetop coffees, flirting in the “office” kitchen, and indulging in afternoon delight sweetened an otherwise horrific time. But as lockdowns lifted and restrictions yo-yoed, that sweetness soured. I made a big change by going freelance and his life was once again dominated by the to-ing and fro-ing of commuting and work. Although all the love and physical affection remained, I lost interest in sex, sensing my libido drop from scant to six-feet-under.  Like most women, I’m used to using mental framing – AKA my imagination – to conjure desire, but getting into the headspace for intimacy required more energy than I could muster. It wasn’t a total drought, I just disliked how I felt about intimacy – dissociated, iced out, even a little bit disgusted. I tried to reassure my partner that the reluctance was about me, not him, but I couldn’t rationalise the epic extinguishing of sexual urges. We’ve had ups and downs in our eight-year relationship, however in my camp, something felt off. When I speak with Helen Mayor, a psychosexual relationship therapist and co-founder of The Thought House, I get a little emotional. I hadn’t realised the shame I had been carrying, and the way I’d squashed what I saw as an insignificant quibble amid a world on its knees. She suggests I could be feeling a loss now that my partner has returned to his normal work life, while mine is now entirely self-motivated, and shot through with the anxieties of self-employment. “What you’re feeling is often a normal point in life, where sex stops being a priority,” she explains. “Sex and sexual excitement is a muscle, and it needs to be exercised.” “In those lockdowns, you experienced spontaneous desire – free pleasure was on offer at home all the time and the more you had sex, the more you wanted it,” she says. Spontaneous desire means impulses show up instantly, with or without stimulation, while responsive desire happens as a result of stimulation. Dr Emily Nagoski’s research finds that men tend to be steadfast in their ability to feel spontaneous desire, but women fluctuate in this sphere. “If you wait for the responsiveness to come back, and it doesn’t, you don’t have sex,” explains Mayor. So how to thaw out my frozen urges? She recommends cultivating a relationship with the erotic through reading, audio erotica or watching porn. “Fantasy is about escape, and you’ve got no demarcation at the moment,” says Mayor. “Go somewhere new after work, order a different drink off the menu, and talk about sex: the best you’ve ever had, the things you want to do, what you love about each other, and in doing that, inhabit a totally different space.” As she explains, long-term love is falling in love with the same person again and again, because we see them differently. Emboldened by the conversation, I relay Mayor’s advice to my partner one evening. Sharing the possible reasons for my predicament is freeing and, unsurprisingly, the talking about having sex is quite a turn-on. The Christmas break arrives and with it, more time to explore. After dinner with friends one night, we peel off and stumble upon a flamboyant Brazilian bar for a nightcap. It feels spontaneous and a little like a package holiday. Talk turns to our fantasies, some of which we’ve shared before, and others are new. I investigate the iterations of a new wave of female-led and created erotica, and I’m spoiled for choice. No Mills & Boon for me – it’s all very slick and discreet. I download a free trial of Ferly, an app designed by sex therapists for “mindful sex”, and find its audio erotica isn’t as cringe-making as I expected. I think I’m better suited to visual aids, though – watching ethical porn together goes down a storm. And while we’re no strangers to lube, Kynect [the new name for KY Jelly] is the kind of product I could imagine using for life, given it’s water based and contains no perfumes, making it gentle enough for daily use. One major block that Mayor sees among sex-neglecting millennials is sleep. Indeed, our bedtime setup is an affront to passion. The cat often sleeps on my chest, and the separate duvets (because I used to steal his half) don’t exactly encourage an explorative hand when the lights go out. “Avoid always making it something that happens at the end of the day,” says Mayor. The morning sex, the post-workout sex, the pre-dinner sex, the post-flossing, pre-bedtime reading sex is gold dust, especially as my partner’s eight hours of beauty sleep is sacred. Fun has been in short supply and desire dampeners have been rife these past few years – Covid scares, money worries, and the claustrophobia that comes from being trapped on our sad little island. I’d forgotten how transportative, fun – and funny – sex can be. We’ve been laughing a lot. Discussion of our fantasies don’t end on our night out, and we’re adding to our list whenever the thoughts arise. There’s a novel lightness in our approach, and the flirty undertones in the most mundane activities are enough to fire up some of that responsive desire in me. Reconnecting with myself and my partner has been like tuning a radio – the haze of white noise and static is gone, and in its place is something I could listen to for life.
