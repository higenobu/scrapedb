4/6/2022,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the condition affects nearly 30% of women between 15 and 44 years old. However, BV disproportionately impacts Black women, who have an estimated infection rate of more than 50%. BV occurs when there’s an overgrowth of bacteria, according to the Mayo Clinic, which throws off the natural pH balance of the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis is most often caused by an overgrowth of a common type of bacteria called gardnerella vaginalis. Certain risk factors, such as douching, can disrupt the balance of “good” and “bad” bacteria in the vagina, leading to this overgrowth. BV can happen to anyone with a vagina, even if you’re not sexually active. However, occurrence in those who are not sexually active is rare. You’re at higher risk for getting BV if you’re pregnant; have a new sex partner, a female sex partner or multiple sex partners; don’t use condoms or dental dams; use douches; or have an intrauterine device (IUD). There is no foolproof way of avoiding bacterial vaginosis. But you can reduce your risk by not douching, limiting sex partners, using latex condoms or dental dams and wearing cotton or cotton-lined underwear. Dr. Jennifer Wider tells Yahoo Life, “Sometimes there are no symptoms, but if there are, the most common include an off-white, gray or greenish, watery vaginal discharge [and] a ‘fishy’ odor that can be strongest during the period or after sex. A less common symptom is itchiness or soreness.” Dr. Kecia Gaither, director of perinatal services at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln in the Bronx points out to Yahoo Life that some people think bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted infection, “hence the stigma,” she says. “But it is not.” However, BV can increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted infection, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, according to the CDC. That, in turn, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. Having BV when you’re pregnant also increases the risk of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy). BV is sometimes mistaken for other conditions like a non-viral STI called trichomoniasis, as well as other bacterial infections including chlamydia and gonorrhea. According to Cleveland Clinic, the most common mix-up occurs between bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections because both are bacterial infections that cause increased discharge. However, there are notable differences between the two infections: discharge with bacterial vaginosis has a fishy smell and is watery in consistency, while discharge from a yeast infection is thick and white with a cottage cheese-like appearance and there isn’t a strong odor. Typically, BV doesn’t cause irritation or itchiness, but a yeast infection will. Finally, yeast infections can be treated with over-the counter-medications or with an antifungal medication, while you will need prescription antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis. The good news is that bacterial vaginosis is curable. The infection is diagnosed through a sample of vaginal fluid taken through a gynecological exam and sent to a lab. After diagnosis, treatment usually involves a seven-day course of antibiotics. Gaither explains that “multiple therapeutic medications have been utilized for treatment like metronidazole, clindamycin and tinidazole.” However, not finishing the full course of antibiotics can trigger a relapse, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Also, in a small percentage of cases, people may need a second treatment. Unfortunately, research shows that BV has a high rate of recurrence — a 2021 study found that BV will recur within six months in more than 50% of cases. Bacterial vaginosis is thankfully considered a mild infection, but it can make you susceptible to more serious health conditions. If you experience any of the symptoms, don’t delay seeing your medical provider. Are Probiotics Actually the Answer to All Your Vagina Problems? Probiotics are imperative for 
keeping your GI system in check. Your vagina is just like 
your gut—it harbors a 
lot of good bacteria. Things like sexual intercourse, 
hormone changes, and fragranced 
feminine hygiene products can 
disrupt the vagina's ecosystem. When that happens, you can 
end up with a yeast infection 
or bacterial vaginosis. An extra dose of probiotics 
can help restore the balance. The key? seek out a 
product that's tailored for 
women's or vaginal health. Look for one ingredient in particular: 
lactobacilli, or lactobacillus 
acidophilus, a strain of good bacteria 
that helps maintain a healthy vagina. Probiotics might keep you from 
needing antibiotics for a yeast 
infection or bacterial vaginosis. There is also evidence that 
they can increase the lactobacilli 
in your system to help prevent 
pesky vaginal infections. Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

4/6/2022,"Lev Gudkov insists that his March opinion poll giving Russian President Vladimir Putin high ratings is honest. He says he is asked about that every day, as people want to know whether Russians tell pollsters the truth or if they mask their feelings out of fear of repercussions. But he is convinced his respondents haven't lied about Putin and this war. Gudkov, who is the director of the Levada Center, Russia's only independent polling outfit, claims the idea that Russians are afraid to tell the truth about politics is a concept primarily spread by dissidents, because it is they who know the steep price of speaking out and have heightened sensitivity about it. Gudkov insists everyone else in Russia is pretty much just under the spell of the state TV propaganda that has been relentlessly pumped into their brains over the last several years, parroting Kremlin lines. For collaborating with some U.S. universities, the Levada Center has been labeled a ""Foreign Agent"" by the Russian government. That means it's under constant threat of ""repressions or liquidation,"" Gudkov said, and Russian organizations have been ordered not to work with the group. Still, it soldiers on. BLLNKEN ACCUSES RUSSIA OF ‘DELIBERATE CAMPAIGN’ TO KILL, TORTURE, RAPE CIVILIANS Levada's latest March polling found that 83% of Russians approve of President Putin's actions and that number has been creeping up since the summer. It was 61% then and went to 65% in January, 71% in February and 83% now that the war has begun. About 81% support the war specifically. ""That is normal,"" Gudkov explains, ""for the beginning of a military mobilization. In the fall of last year, the propaganda and demagoguery really ramped up."" ""Anti-Western and anti-Ukrainian sentiment was stirred, and we hadn't seen such fear about the real possibility of war before. Seventy-three percent of people were scared about a world war,"" he told Fox News. Gudkov said that due to Russia's censorship and the extreme lack of independent news outlets, the high ratings — what many would call shockingly high — for the Ukraine invasion reflected the power of Kremlin propaganda. RUSSIA PREPARING OFFENSIVE IN SOUTHERN, EASTERN UKRAINE, OFFICIALS SAYS Gudkov explained, however, that views varied between villages and small to medium cities and the bigger cities. In bigger cities, he said, the dominant mood was ""shame, despair, depression, anxiety and discouragement"" about the war, he explained. ""Where people are more educated, more informed, I would say the atmosphere is more one of panic. Large metropolitan areas have been the first to feel the effect of sanctions and understand the catastrophic situation this will lead to in a few months,"" Gudkov explained, adding that the economic hardship hitting cities will make its way eventually to the heartland — and at that point, opinion there could change, too. There was something called the ""Crimean Consensus"" that Putin got after annexing the storied peninsula. Then, his popularity shot to 89%. There has been wide agreement that the patriotic moment has passed, and so has the boost the president got from it. This war with its thousands of dead soldiers is unlikely to have the same impact on society. ""This doesn't compare to 2014 when there were strong emotions and euphoria about Crimea and the sense that Russia was a great power again,"" Gudkov says. He did say that anti-Americanism has been on the rise. Around 73% of Russians had a negative opinion of the United States. Gudkov said feelings about America ebbed and flowed in proportion to the volume and tenor of the propaganda put out by state media. It was intense during the NATO bombing of Belgrade, the war in Georgia, the taking of Crimea — and, as a result, anti-Americanism shot up in those moments. The Kremlin, meanwhile, hasn't produced credible evidence of a ""Nazi"" problem in Ukraine. ""Of course there isn't any,"" he replied. ""It's a way to discredit the enemy. For Putin, a successful Ukraine integrated into the European Union is a threat to the stability of his regime.""",World/Fox News,"Reporter's Notebook: As Ukraine war drags on, Putin's high approval rating in Russia called into question",https://news.yahoo.com/reporter-apos-notebook-ukraine-war-211540303.html
4/6/2022,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland on Monday berated French President Emmanuel Macron for negotiating with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, saying ""nobody negotiated with Hitler"", amid an international outcry over killings of civilians during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine on Sunday accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in Bucha and Western leaders reacted with outrage to images of bodies strewn across the streets of the town. Russia denies Ukraine's accusation. Poland has on many occasions called for harsher sanctions on Russia and supply more arms to Ukraine. It has also called for an international tribunal to investigate killings of civilians in Ukraine. ""Mr. President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin, what have you achieved? Have you stopped any of the actions that have taken place?"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at a press conference on Monday. ""One should not negotiate with criminals, one should fight them...Nobody negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot?"" he added. Macron's office said in a response that it is important for President Putin to understand the demands of Western countries and the cost for Russia of disregarding them. ""From the onset, the president has used all available means to make Putin stop the war: massive sanctions, support to Ukraine, demands made directly to President Putin during their calls,"" a French presidential official said. Macron has spared no effort to mediate between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, travelling to Moscow and Kyiv in early February and speaking to Putin 16 times since the start of the year in telephone conversations the Elysée says have been confrontational but offered an opportunity to keep a communication channel open and gauge Putin’s state of mind. Elysée officials have in the past offered scathing readouts of the calls, saying Putin has appeared ""paranoid"" in these calls, has lied to the French leader and that Macron told him he made a serious mistake in invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russia sent its forces into Ukraine on what Putin called a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
