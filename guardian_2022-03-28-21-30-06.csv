3/28/2022,"Chinese telecoms company Huawei has reported a decrease in sales but record profit for 2021, as its top executive, Meng Wanzhou, made her first public appearance since being released from Canadian custody last autumn. The Shenzhen-based company said on Monday its net profits surged 75.9% year on year to 113.7bn yuan (£13.6bn), despite US sanctions. But its revenue skidded 29% to 636.8bn yuan, in line with Huawei’s previous forecast in December. Over the past decade, Huawei rose to become the symbol of China’s growing technological prowess. When the US-China trade and technology rivalry intensified in 2018, the company was caught in the crosshairs. Former US president Donald Trump had moved to cripple Huawei over security and espionage concerns. Meng was arrested in Canada in 2018 at the request of the US after being accused of lying to banks in Hong Kong about Huawei’s dealings with Iran. The Chinese authorities, in return, arrested two Canadians. Both were freed as Meng went home last year. State media hailed it as a diplomatic victory for China. The tech firm attributes its profitability to “improved product portfolios and more efficient internal operations”. It also said its HarmonyOS was used in more than 220m Huawei devices as of 2021, “becoming the world’s fastest growing mobile device operating system”. Huawei is not a publicly listed company, so its accounts are not subject to the same level of audit as companies traded on the stock market. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Meng, the company’s chief financial officer and the daughter of Huawei’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, said despite a revenue decline in the past year, the company’s ability to make a profit and generate cashflows was increasing. It was also more capable of dealing with uncertainty, she added. Meng acknowledged the challenges sanctions have brought to her company. “The multiple rounds of sanctions imposed by the US have significantly affected our business, especially smartphones and PCs,” she said. Huawei logged 243bn yuan in consumer business sales – almost 50% down from 2020. Despite this, the company appeared to be determined that the only way forward is to double down on its investments in research and development. Huawei spent 142.7bn yuan last year on R&D, which was about 22.4% of its total revenue. Guo Ping, Huawei’s rotating chairman, said the company would continue to attract “world-class talent” and double down on its partnerships with top universities around the world to set up joint labs, despite increased level of scrutiny in the west. “Our fight to survive is not over yet,” he said. “No matter what comes our way, we will keep investing. That is the only way forward.” One of the most imminent uncertainties the company must face is the future of its presence in Russia. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine yet again put Chinese companies under the international scrutiny as western businesses, including McDonald’s, pulled out of the market. “Some countries have come up with policies [vis-a-vis Russia], but they are complex and constantly changing,” said Guo, referring to Russian sanctions, adding: “We are carefully evaluating them.” He added that Huawei had no plan to promote HarmonyOS in Russia for the time being.",News/Technology,China’s Huawei reports sales fall amid US sanctions but profits hit record,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/28/china-huawei-sales-us-sanctions-profits-meng-wanzhou
3/28/2022,"Downing Street’s long-awaited energy independence strategy is now not expected to be published until next week, amid wrangling between Number 10 and the Treasury over how to fund it. Boris Johnson’s cabinet ministers have a range of views on the best way forward: Kwasi Kwarteng: the business secretary is an avowed enthusiast for green energy sources, and has made clear he thinks the Ukraine situation only makes them more important. He has publicly suggested planning rules may need to be liberalised to facilitate new onshore wind development, reversing the effective moratorium imposed by David Cameron’s government. Kwarteng has also previously made clear his scepticism about fracking, the controversial practice of domestic shale gas extraction. He has toned down his rhetoric of late, however, insisting he has no objection in principle, but wants to see scientific evidence that it is safe. Jacob Rees-Mogg: the Brexit opportunities minister has urged Boris Johnson to press ahead with fracking, whose advocates have become more vocal since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underlined the arguments for energy independence. On a recent episode of his regular “Moggcast”, he called shale gas “very clean” and dismissed concerns about earth tremors, saying they were, “equivalent to a bus passing by your house”, and “not the San Francisco earthquake”. Like most cabinet ministers, Rees Mogg also backs a more rapid expansion of domestic nuclear power. He is more sceptical about onshore wind power, however, with a small-c conservative dislike of turbines scattered across the British countryside. Boris Johnson: the prime minister is enthusiastic about expanding domestic nuclear production. The lengthy timelines mean it will make little short-term contribution to the UK’s energy independence, but he called in industry experts last week to discuss how to speed up the building of new plants. Johnson has been sceptical about wind power in the past, once notoriously suggesting in one of his contrarian columns that it would not “pull the skin off a rice pudding”, but aides say he is now keen on a rapid expansion of offshore wind – and open-minded about onshore generation. On fracking, Kwarteng cited a conversation with Johnson to explain the recent softening of his position. Downing Street insists no decision has yet been made – but say given the seriousness of the situation, all options must be on the table. Rishi Sunak: the chancellor rarely mentions net zero in his public pronouncements – it didn’t feature in last week’s spring statement speech, for example. Aides say that’s not because he is a sceptic, but because he believes private sector investment will need to do much of the work in funding the transition. Meanwhile, he has been keen to grant new licences for North Sea extraction, telling the Mail on Sunday earlier this month: “In the short term we need to make sure we are helping people with the cost of energy but also recognising that things like natural gas have a role to play in our transition. We are going to get to net zero over decades, not over days and weeks.” Sunak has suggested he is not opposed to fracking in principle, but wants to see evidence that it is safe – a similar line to Kwarteng’s. He and Johnson have been wrangling in recent days about the funding for new nuclear power plants. Michael Gove: The levelling-up secretary told a recent environment reception he was “not convinced” of the case for fracking, and would like to see more onshore – as well as offshore – wind developed, alongside solar and nuclear. As Kwarteng has made clear, that would be likely to require a change in the planning system – which Gove oversees. The Cameron government did not ban new onshore wind developments, but made them subject to stringent local consultation, which ministers admit has been tantamount to a moratorium. Alok Sharma: with the Glasgow summit over, the UK’s Cop26 president is regarded as the government’s conscience on net zero, telling the Guardian in a December interview, “given that people do see that the UK has shown a great deal of international leadership when it comes to climate, it’s important we maintain that focus across the whole of the UK government”. Not surprisingly, he is known to be sceptical about fracking, and has made clear publicly that drilling more in the North Sea will do nothing to bring down domestic prices. “Ultimately the price that’s going to be generated is going to be the international wholesale gas price,” he has said.",News/Environment,UK energy independence strategy: what are the cabinet divisions?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/cabinet-divisions-over-uk-energy-independence-strategy-boris-johnson
3/28/2022,"Three sea caves hewn into the rocky coastline of Dorset that are the bat equivalent of a speed-dating site, attracting crowds of the flying mammals from as far as 40 miles away, have been acquired by the National Trust. The bats gather at Winspit caves near Swanage in the late summer and early autumn, dart around the cliffs and, if all goes well, find a mate from a different colony. The National Trust said on Monday it had acquired the farmland that includes the three sea caves, plus one inland cave. “It’s effectively a big party when the bats arrive,” said David Brown, National Trust ecologist for Purbeck. “They fly huge distances to favourite spots like this, mixing with bats from other colonies. The caves are also perfect for the bats to roost in, full of nooks and crannies.” Fifteen species of bats had been recorded on the 350-acre Weston Farm site on the South Purbeck coast, making it Dorset’s most important “swarming site” – and one of national importance – with bats flying in from across the county and even farther afield to meet and mate on the wing. The bats sweep into the three cliff caves – created by quarrying for Purbeck stone – from the seaside. They can also dart into another inland cave also created by quarrying. Brown said this “speed-dating” was important to ensure the genetic health of bat populations. Among the creatures that are found there are the rare serotine and barbastelle bats. The caves are also used for winter hibernation for some of the UK’s rarest bats such as the greater horseshoe. The land forms the eastern half of St Aldhem’s Head, and will extend the existing trust-owned “Purbeck Wares”, an important habitat for orchids and other wildflowers. The coastal strip includes ancient “strip lynchet” terraced field systems. Brown added: “We aim to create a landscape that is richer in nature, so there’ll be no chemical inputs or regular ploughing on any of the land and life will be restored to the soil using natural regenerative farming methods. As the land is given time to rest and recover, the ground will store more carbon and streams flowing off the land will be cleaner and healthier.” Over the coming years, the farm, which has been in the same family for more than 100 years and through three generations, is to be transformed into a mosaic of species-rich grasslands, wildflower meadows, scrub and woodlands. Conservation grazing of the grasslands sloping down to the coast should bring back plants such as the green-winged and early spider orchids. Restored meadows on the former arable fields will hopefully bloom with cowslips and knapweeds, and these flower-rich grasslands will become home to rare butterflies such as the Lulworth skipper and adonis blue. This will also open up nesting sites for endangered skylarks. Hedgerows, scrub and small woodland patches are intended to give refuge to voles and other mammals, and create breeding sites for birds including yellowhammers and linnets. This stretch of coastline is also the summer pit-stop for visiting birds such as whitethroats. As well as being good for bats, the trust says it will improve access for human visitors. Brown said: “In the future people will enjoy fantastic uninterrupted access along a 7km stretch of some of the UK’s best coastline, and be free to explore some its most diverse and ecologically rich grasslands.”",News/Environment,National Trust acquires Dorset ‘speed-dating’ caves for bats,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/national-trust-acquires-dorset-speed-dating-caves-for-bats
3/28/2022,"Wild garlic is one of the more romantic foraged foods, with its pretty white flowers, lush leaves and predilection for lurking in shady woodland areas. Finding a crop on walks is always rather magical, and who doesn’t like free food? Whether you’re eating the leaves or the flowers, they need to be tempered by calmer ingredients. Macaroni cheese is a perfect vehicle, producing a meltingly green and cheesy pasta dish with a big waft of garlic. Bliss. This is a great way to use up odds and ends of different cheeses – the more variety, the better the flavour.

Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat, add the onion and saute gently for eight to 10 minutes. Add the flour, turn down the heat to medium and cook for three to four minutes, until a pale toasty colour. Slowly pour in the milk bit by bit, stirring vigorously between each addition to ensure it has been incorporated, until you have a smooth sauce. Add the wild garlic and cheese, stir until the cheese has melted, then taste and season. Meanwhile, fry the breadcrumbs. Put a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the olive oil and 20g butter. Add the garlic, cook for a minute, then add the crumbs and season. Fry, stirring, for seven to eight minutes, until the crumbs are browned and turning crisp, then take off the heat and stir in the cheese, thyme and paprika. Stir three-quarters of the cheese sauce into the macaroni, and pour into a large baking dish. Top with the remaining sauce, scatter the breadcrumbs all over and bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden and bubbling. Eat at once with a crisp salad. Crisp pancetta or melted anchovies make an indulgent but delicious addition to the sauce. If wild garlic is hard to find, use bulb garlic instead and add some wilted spinach or kale for colour.

3/28/2022,"Here is a cinematic adaptation of Léo Delibes’ ballet that blends animation, visual effects and live-action dancing, drawing on the rejigged story and score created for a Dutch National Ballet production of the show from 2008. Like several other modern productions, this version updates to the present the 19th-century ETA Hoffman-derived story of a village boy lured away from his human sweetheart by a mechanical doll controlled by an evil genius. Instead of a lifesize wind-up toy danced by a prima ballerina, here Coppelia is imagined as an animated dancebot whose high blond beehive with flip curls recalls Lisa Marie’s alien temptress from Mars Attacks! Her controller, Doctor Coppelius (Vito Mazzeo), seems to be offering his services to the townsfolk as a kind of plastic surgeon, but he’s actually using brainwashing techniques to steal their human essences – strength, intelligence and something symbolised by a heart (emotional intelligence? Passion? Emoji power?) – and transfer them into Coppelia. Local juice bar jockey Swan (Michaela DePrince) works out something is seriously amiss and teams up with her corps de ballet pals to thwart Coppelius and save her true love Franz (Daniel Camargo). Semiretired ballet superstar Darcey Bussell is on hand as the town’s mayor, but she is careful not to upstage DePrince, who really shines with a natural photogenic presence, strong acting skills and athletic form. The whole shooting match eschews the use of dialogue, so for all its modernist trappings it’s a pretty traditional ballet production – though one that uses a lot of green screen backgrounds and digital dancers. When the latter, with their uncanny-valley features, perform alongside the human cast, the difference in expressiveness is oddly unsettling, making this feel like some insane mashup of the silent film classic Metropolis, old-school dance and the children’s TV show LazyTown from the early 00s. But in a mostly fun way.  Coppelia is released on 1 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Coppelia review – ballet gets modern makeover with live-action dance and animation,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/coppelia-review-ballet-gets-modern-makeover-with-live-action-dance-and-animation

3/28/2022,"The German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centre-left party has passed its first electoral test since entering government, after the Social Democratic party secured a rare absolute majority at Saarland state elections. Led by Anke Rehlinger, a trained lawyer and former shot putter, the SPD won 43.5% of Sunday’s vote in the small state on the French border. “That’s not just a narrow majority,” she told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. “That’s quite a significant majority with 29 seats.” The result could in theory mean the first single-party government in the Saarland since 1970, a rarity in Germany’s increasingly fragmented political landscape. The conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which has governed in the Saarland continuously since 1999, suffered a major defeat, dropping 12 percentage points. The state’s premier, Tobias Hans, signalled his resignation on Sunday night, saying there would be “personal consequences” from the result. While the CDU’s polling figures have rallied at a national level after the combative Friedrich Merz took over the party following a historic defeat at federal elections last September, the Saarland result suggests there may be more to the centre-left’s revival than good fortune. The SDP performed particularly strongly among usually conservative-voting over-60s, 50% of whom voted centre-left this time around, and also gained a significant number of votes from former supporters of Die Linke. Saarland was once seen as one of the few strongholds of the leftwing party in western Germany, with 21.3% of the vote being achieved as recently as 2009. However, on Sunday it secured just 2.6%, a fall of more than 10 percentage points that meant an exit from the state parliament. The election came just weeks after Oskar Lafontaine, a former SPD state premier in the region who had gone on to co-found Die Linke, rescinded his party membership, citing the new leadership’s support for exporting lethal weapons to Ukraine. The Green party and the liberal Free Democratic party, which both govern in a coalition with the SPD at federal level, made minor gains in Sunday’s vote but narrowly failed to reach the electoral threshold for parliamentary representation. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which made small losses but won 5.7% of the vote, will be the smallest of three parties in the next state parliament. The durability of the SPD’s revival will be tested more strenuously at state elections in the CDU-led Schleswig-Holstein on 8 May and the populous North-Rhine Westphalia on 15 May.",News/World news,Olaf Scholz’s SPD secures major win in Saarland state election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/olaf-scholz-spd-major-win-saarland-state-election-centre-left
3/28/2022,"The Oscars are always searching for a viral moment, and in 2022 they found it with a vengeance. When Will Smith mounted the stage to attack presenter Chris Rock, it was apparently motivated by Rock’s joke at his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s expense: “Jada, GI Jane 2, can’t wait to see it.” Rock’s joke referenced the 1997 war film in which Demi Moore, playing a navy lieutenant signing up for a reconnaissance, famously shaves her head into a close crop. In 2021 Pinkett Smith posted a video on Instagram in which she revealed her closely shaven style, writing “Mama’s gonna have to take it down to the scalp … Me and this alopecia are going to be friends … period!” Pinkett Smith first talked publicly about her hair loss in 2018, which she suspected may be caused by stress. She said: “I’ve been getting a lot of questions about why I’ve been wearing this turban … Well, I’ve been having issues with hair loss. And it was terrifying when it first started.” Alopecia is commonly caused by an autoimmune condition that attacks the hair follicles. However, Smith’s assault on Rock may have been presaged by the regular targeting of Smiths’ marriage by gossip columnists and awards-show hosts for some time for its “open” nature; as recently as two weeks ago, Bafta host Rebel Wilson said: “Personally I thought his [Will Smith’s] best performance in the past year has been being OK with all of his wife’s boyfriends.” The pair married in 1997 after meeting on the set of the TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. In 2020 Pinkett Smith acknowledged having had a relationship with musician August Alsina while she and Smith were separated. Smith added to the speculation in an interview in GQ in September 2021 in which he said: “Marriage for us can’t be a prison.” Pinkett Smith, 50, grew up in Baltimore and made her movie breakthrough in the 1994 Keenen Ivory Wayans action comedy A Low Down Dirty Shame. She subsequently appeared in high-profile 90s films such as The Nutty Professor and Set It Off, before being cast in the 2003 Matrix sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions as human rebel Niobe. Pinkett Smith also moved into directing and production, as well as maintaining a string of business interests.

3/28/2022,"In 2018, archaeologists moving bodies for reburial from a 19th-century cemetery in Birmingham to make way for the new HS2 station were puzzled to find several that had plates on their laps. Then someone remembered a curious custom from the nearby Welsh Marches – that of the village “sin-eater”. A plate of bread and salt would be placed on the deceased’s lap while they were lying in repose. Just before the coffin was closed and the funeral cortege set off for the church, the village sin-eater arrived, ate the bread and was given some coins and a glass of ale for their trouble. The belief was that the deceased’s sins were absorbed by the salt and transferred into the bread, and then into the sin-eater. Sin-eaters were usually elderly and destitute, and glad to have the money – not to mention the free food and drink. The price they paid was to be shunned by their community because of their macabre associations. The last known sin-eater was Richard Munslow, who died aged 73 in 1906. Sin-eating reminds us that, more than anything else, even the most staid of religions – in this case, Anglicanism – can be associated with surprisingly curious beliefs and rituals. Perhaps because of this, it has often been claimed that religious belief arises from ignorance and superstition. If that were the case, you might expect religion to gradually fade away as societies became better educated and more scientifically oriented. There are at least two reasons, however, why religions persist. One is the fact that, on average, religious people are generally happier, healthier and live longer. For better or for worse, they also have easier deaths when the time comes. The other is that religious people are more likely to feel that they belong to a community. In a survey I ran, those who reported attending religious services were depressed less frequently, felt their lives were more worthwhile, were more engaged with their local community, and felt greater trust towards others. These enormous benefits mean not only that religion has enduring appeal, but that religious practices make you “fit” in the evolutionary sense – and thus they tend to stick around. Part of the reason people are attracted to religion is that its rituals – the standing, sitting and kneeling in unison, the singing, the listening to emotionally rousing sermons – trigger the brain’s endorphin system. This is the mechanism that underpins social bonding in all primates, including humans. Like opiates, endorphins produce a sense of bliss bordering on ecstasy, calmness and warmth, relaxation and trust, while elevating pain thresholds. In addition to these hedonic benefits, endorphins trigger the release of natural killer cells (part of the body’s immune system). Endorphins also underpin the bonding of friendships and, through that, allow us to create supportive groups of like-minded individuals. This effect seems to be especially strong in the context of rituals, as has been shown experimentally in religious services in the UK and Brazil. It seems, therefore, that religions evolved to reinforce a sense of community cohesion, something that’s extremely important to our wellbeing and survival. Our natural community size – the size of our personal social network, the number of friends we have on Facebook – is part of a relationship between group size and brain size in primates. Each species has a characteristic group size determined by the size of its brain. Ours is about 150. Not only is this the average size of personal social networks (the number of extended family and friends with whom you have meaningful relationships), but it also turns out to be the optimal size for religious congregations. If a congregation is smaller than about 100, it puts a heavy burden on the membership; if it is above about 200, it becomes increasingly prone to divisiveness. This seems to explain why big religions are so susceptible to fragmentation – constantly throwing up small sects (typically of a few hundred people at most) built round a charismatic leader whose wayward beliefs the hierarchy desperately tries to contain. Social bonding is important, of course, to many species. But there’s an aspect of religion that seems to be peculiarly human. Being able to engage in religious discussion – and hence explain the significance of the rituals and why you should take part – depends on the kinds of mind-reading, or “mentalising”, skills that play a crucial role in managing our everyday relationships. These are the skills that allow us to understand what someone else is thinking, to grasp their intentions. They allow us to utter sentences such as, “I know that you realise that Freddie believes that …” To be able to do this, I have to be able to step back from the immediacy of the physical world so as to imagine the possibility that you might or might not think this, that Freddie might or might not intend whatever you thought he did, and even whether the person Freddie had in mind did or did not think what Freddie thought they did. Apes can do the first two steps in this chain, but that’s the limit. For humans, it comes easily, bringing with it an ability to imagine parallel worlds inhabited by invisible beings. It’s a short step from there to religious ideas, which in turn lead to better bonding, which makes you more likely to survive. Survival means your superior mentalising skills will be passed on to a new generation, equally adept at religious thinking; a penchant for religion is therefore part of our genetic inheritance. But that’s not all. The same cognitive abilities that give us religion also allow us to ask why the world has to be the way it is (giving us science) and to imagine entirely fictional worlds (giving us literature). Thus, you could no more have a world where religion was cast aside as superstition than you could have one without science or stories. And that would be a very different world indeed.
