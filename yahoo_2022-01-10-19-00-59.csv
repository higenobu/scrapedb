1/10/2022,"They call it bitcoin’s “death cross” – a bearish indicator which appears when the 50-day moving average (MA) dips below the 200-day MA. The ominously-named chart pattern looks set to be confirmed this week amid mounting concerns of faster liquidity withdrawal by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), a bearish development for bitcoin and asset prices, in general. Goldman Sachs foresees the Fed raising borrowing costs at least four times by the end of 2022 versus the previous prediction of three rate hikes, according to Bloomberg. The investment banking giant also expects the central bank to downsize its balance sheet from July. Friday’s U.S. labor market report, which showed that unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%, has strengthened the case for the Fed to hike rates concurrently with the end of asset purchases in March. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, investors were pricing a 73% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike in March, up from 61% last week. Fears of a hawkish Fed gripped the bitcoin market towards the end of last quarter after the central bank shifted its focus to inflation control from maximum employment. In December, the Fed announced at least three rate hikes by the end of 2022 and an end of the asset purchase program by March. Bitcoin peaked near $69,000 on Nov. 10 and has declined nearly 40% since. The cryptocurrency slipped over 12% in the last seven days to Jan. 9, registering its biggest weekly drop since early December. The impending death cross, coupled with the souring macro outlook, may bolster overall bearish sentiment. That said, the technical indicator’s past record as a predictor of bear markets is mixed. According to research by Kraken, many of bitcoin’s previous death crosses, including those seen in 2014 and 2018, coincided with “either a sell-off in the days that followed or a continued macro downtrend that confirmed a bear market.” However, death crosses witnessed in June 2021, late March 2020, and October 2019 were bear traps or false signals that marked major price bottoms. The consolidation seen after the mid-June 2021 death cross resolved in a fresh bull run, as seen in the featured image. Moving average crossovers are unreliable as standalone indicators, given they are based on backward-looking data and tend to lag prices. The market is often oversold and due for a bounce by the time the crossover is confirmed, as was the case in June last year and late March 2020. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $42,100, representing a 0.5% gain on the day.",Business/CoinDesk•2 hours ago,Bitcoin Approaches Death Cross as Goldman Foresees 4 Fed Rate Hikes This Year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-approaches-death-cross-goldman-075828371.html
1/10/2022,"Before Monday’s (Jan 10) trading truly kicks into action, Tilray (TLRY) will release its November (F2Q22) quarter results. Ahead of the print, Cantor’s Pablo Zuanic believes the trends are not tilting in the Canadian LP’s favor. “Unless the company issues bullish forward commentary, we expect the stock to face pressure from the November quarter print,” the analyst forewarned. While Zuanic notes that cannabis makes up less than half of the company’s sales (in the August quarter they accounted for 42% of total revs), he is less focused on the metrics of the non-cannabis elements - such as CC Pharma, craft beer, hemp food - preferring to gauge the company’s health through the prism of the cannabis business. And according to Hifyre, the top-line action has not been all that great. In the November quarter, recreational sales saw a sequential drop of 16%, despite the market overall growing by 5%. The trends for December are not very promising, either, with Hifyre data showing sales dropped by 3% month-over-month as the market saw growth of 8%. While Zuanic concedes that in December Tilray still held the #1 position in rec, it only claimed a 10.8% share, with the figure amounting to an 8-point year-over-year drop. However, Zuanic does note that TLRY’s share may be higher as Hifyre “tends to underestimate Quebeq exposure, where we understand TLRY is overindexed vs. most peers ex-HEXO.” As for the other indicators, Zuanic expects export trends to remain “stable” although he is concerned that based on “operating deleverage and ongoing price deflation,” cannabis gross margins could drop from the August quarter’s 43%. Where the headline numbers are concerned (which Zuanic calls “less relevant”), he projects total sales of $163 million and total EBITDA of $10 million, compared to the Street’s forecast of $174 million and $14 million, respectively. Overall, Zuanic believes Tilray’s cannabis business is currently valued “well above the peer group average,” and as such, the analyst rates TLRY as a Neutral (i.e., Hold), while the price target gets a trim from $11.80 to $7.40. Nevertheless, there’s still upside of 15% from current levels. (To watch Zuanic’s track record, click here) Rating wise, Zuanic’ colleagues agree. Barring 1 Buy and Sell, each, all 5 others say Hold, culminating in a Hold consensus rating. However, the average target remains a bullish one; at $10.52, investors could see returns of 64% over the one-year timeframe.
