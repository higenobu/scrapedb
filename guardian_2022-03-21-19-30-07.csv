3/21/2022,"Toward the Unknown Region, Manchester’s celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Ralph Vaughan Williams, shared between the BBC Philharmonic and Hallé orchestras, does not confine itself to the nine symphonies. So although the second concert in the series, conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, included two of Vaughan Williams’s greatest orchestral achievements, only one of those was a symphony. That was the Fourth, which was played alongside the ballet score composed immediately before it, the “masque for dancing”, Job. The brutal power unleashed by the BBC Philharmonic in the Fourth provided more than enough symphonic substance for one concert, however. Davis never attempted to soften any of its raw edges, or play down the grotesqueries, whether in the grinding dissonances of the opening, the violent changes of mood in the scherzo, with its clod-hopping trio, or the militaristic swagger of its finale. Nothing else in Vaughan Williams’s output is quite like it. Certainly the contrast between the primary-coloured symphony and the refinement and pastel shades of much of Job was a telling one. There are many moments of savagery in the ballet score, as well as brilliant orchestral characterisations, such as the use of a wheedling solo saxophone to personify Job’s comforters. But the music that really defines the work is rapturous and contemplative, and that is epitomised by the epilogue, which Davis lulled into silence with exquisite tact. Joined by the Hallé Choir, he and the orchestra had begun with the carefully shaped account of the work that gives the series its title, and which here provided a reminder of where Vaughan Williams’ personal musical journey had begun. Walt Whitman’s poetry may not have been the most obvious text for an aspiring British composer in the early 1900s, but the solid, four-square choral setting of it in Toward the Unknown Region is an mistakable legacy of Victorian England; after it would come more Whitman settings in A Sea Symphony, and there the real composer would emerge for the first time.

3/21/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine has defied an ultimatum by the Russian military for its forces to surrender the city of Mariupol, as shelling continued in Kyiv and the US president, Joe Biden, announced that he would visit Ukraine’s western neighbour Poland this week. Despite Mariupol being besieged by Russian forces for almost four weeks, the Ukrainian government in Kyiv gave short shrift to Moscow’s demand for the city’s defenders to “lay down arms” by 5am Moscow time (2amGMT) on Monday. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said that there could be no question of surrender. Meanwhile, Biden will fly to Europe for the summit with Nato allies, G7 leaders and European Union leaders and will then travel to Poland on Friday to discuss the “humanitarian and human rights crisis” Russia’s actions have caused, the White House said on late last night. What did Vereshchuk say? “There can be no talk of any surrenders, laying down of arms. We have already informed the Russian side about this,” she said. Are diplomatic efforts continuing? Yes, Biden will host a call today with president Emmanuel Macron of France, chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi, and the British prime minister Boris Johnson. What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 26 of the invasion. Ketanji Brown Jackson appears before the Senate judiciary committee today, at the start of confirmation hearings that could see her become the first Black woman to sit on the US supreme court since it was founded more than two centuries ago. The hearings, scheduled to run for four days, are critical not just for their history-making potential. Whether Joe Biden succeeds in placing his nominee on the nation’s highest court, ideally with bipartisan backing, could help to make or break his presidency. Jackson, at 51, would be the second youngest member of the nine-person court after Amy Coney Barrett, should she survive the upcoming white-water ride. Though her appointment would leave the six-to-three rightwing balance of the court – she would replace fellow liberal-leaning Stephen Breyer – she could play a seminal role in shaping the country’s legal landscape for decades to come. What happens today? Today’s hearing will be devoted to opening statements from Jackson and from the committee’s 22 senators, who are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. When will a decision be made? Two days of questioning of the candidate will follow today’s hearing, with outside witnesses called on Thursday. A full vote of the Senate is expected to determine Jackson’s fate before a recess on 8 April. A Chinese airliner with 133 people onboard has crashed in the southern province of Guangxi, sparking a mountainside fire, state media reported. Broadcaster CCTV said the crash, involving a China Eastern 737, occurred near the city of Wuzhou in Teng county. It said rescuers had been dispatched and there were no immediate details of the numbers of dead and injured. The Boeing 737 plane went down in the countryside near Wuzhou city, Guangxi region, and caused a mountain fire, CCTV said, citing the provincial emergency management bureau. Local media reported that China Eastern flight MU5735 had not arrived at its scheduled destination in Guangzhou after it took off from the city of Kunming shortly after 1pm (5am GMT) on Monday, citing airport staff. Has China Eastern commented yet? No. There was no immediate response from China Eastern when contacted by AFP. The US is likely to see an increase in Covid cases like that in Europe and the UK as a result of the BA.2 virus subvariant, but not a dangerous surge, Anthony Fauci said yesterday. Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser also said the US was “clearly going in the right direction” on the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans who support Vladimir Putin over the Russian invasion of Ukraine are “lonely voices” in the party, Mitch McConnell said. Republicans in Washington have expressed concern that Carlson has veered too close to defending the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The Biden administration intends to declare that Myanmar’s years-long repression of the Rohingya Muslim population is a “genocide”, US officials said yesterday. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to make the long-anticipated designation today at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Morad Tahbaz, the British-Iranian-American citizen left behind last week when two dual nationals were allowed to return home to the UK, has been taken from Evin prison to a hotel in Tehran after representations by the British and American governments, the UK’s Foreign Office has said. When an essay from a prominent Shanghai scholar suggested China needed to cut ties with Putin as soon as possible over the Ukraine war, the online reaction was swift. Despite being published late on a Friday evening in the Carter Center’s US-China Perception Monitor, Hu Wei’s essay soon gained a million views in and outside China, and was republished into Chinese blogs, non-official media sites and social media accounts. Then came the backlash and by yesterday morning, their websites were blocked in China. Chloë Sevigny has had a unique career path. She’s switched between indie films and sitcoms, taken risky roles and lived a parallel life as a style idol, which has given her a cult celebrity. She has skirted the mainstream for years, never quite becoming a household name. But to some – those who grew up reading the magazines that tracked her years as a 1990s cool girl via films such as Kids and Gummo – she is a fashion and arthouse superstar. Here she tells Emine Saner about about being an indie icon. Sleep-deprived Americans may be rejoicing, if they have the energy: it could be the last time daylight saving time kills a precious hour of snoozing. But those extra hours of evening light could come at a cost. Last Tuesday, days after we moved our clocks forward, the Senate – which refuses to tackle the climate crisis or ensure people can vote – somehow managed to unanimously support a bill to make daylight saving time permanent. But sleep experts warn they are taking the wrong approach to a real problem. Startling heatwaves at both of Earth’s poles are causing alarm among climate scientists, who have warned the “unprecedented” events could signal faster and abrupt climate breakdown. Temperatures in Antarctica reached record levels at the weekend, an astonishing 40C above normal in places. At the same time, weather stations near the north pole also showed signs of melting, with some temperatures 30C above normal, hitting levels normally attained far later in the year. What’s causing ‘extraordinary’ heating in polar regions? Here’s what the experts have told us about how unusual this is and why it is happening. Bewley’s Cafe on Grafton Street has been a Dublin institution ever since it opened almost 100 years ago but it is facing an existential threat over a plan to sell the six large stained glass windows in the main coffee hall in a dispute over rent. The question as to whether they are windows or decorative panels, which can be removed altogether, is now at the centre of a high court battle – with the commercial tenants arguing that they are movable artworks, not windows.

3/21/2022,"The headteacher of Eton college has said its plans to open three “Etons of the north” in deprived areas of England would not “cream off the bright kids” from local schools, amid concern from educators. The world’s most famous private school is planning to open free elite selective sixth-form colleges in Oldham, Dudley and Middlesbrough by 2025 in partnership with Star Academies. The announcement has been met with a mix of glee from local leaders and consternation from some headteachers. One said teachers were “upset and angry” while another questioned the need for more provision at time when colleges are being merged. Simon Henderson, Eton’s headteacher, said the new sixth-forms – which would each admit 240 students annually – would “raise standards for everybody” and close the gap between pupils who do well at GCSEs but fail to achieve strong A-levels. He said: “Some critics say ‘well, you’re just creaming off the bright kids – these kids were going to do well anyway’. The evidence suggests that’s not actually true. “We hope that some of the partnership work we’ll be doing with the 11-to-16 schools in the area will benefit all of the students in those schools, not just the ones that end up coming to [Eton-Star’s] schools.” Pupils at the new “Etons of the north” will be selected based on GCSE results and their background. Priority will be given to those eligible for free school meals, looked-after children, those from the most deprived postcodes and those who would be the first in their family to go to university. Henderson said a rigorous admissions policy was being drawn up to prevent middle-class parents from “gaming” the system to monopolise places. The proposals will be put forward to the government’s free schools programme, a key part of its levelling up agenda. In what may come as a relief to the teenagers of Oldham, Middlesbrough and Dudley, Henderson said it was “unlikely” they would wear the traditional Eton uniform of white tie and black tailcoat. However, he said there would be “certain features of an Eton experience that we definitely want to replicate”. Students will be able to join debating clubs, learn Latin, be taught by Eton “beaks” in Oxbridge-style tutorials, attend summer school at the 582-year-old institution. The schools could also take on the Eton name, although that is yet to be decided. Henderson said the three chosen areas all had a gap between students who perform well in GCSEs but fail to achieve strong A-level results. Each of the areas would need more sixth-form provision in the coming years, he said, and were chosen partly due to their good transport links. Arooj Shah, the leader of Oldham council, hailed the initiative as a “gamechanger” for the borough and said it would benefit families “for generations to come”. There has been concern, however, that the elite schools will only benefit a small number of already high-achieving pupils and would not improve attainment overall. Tom Richmond, director of the thinktank EDSK and a former policy adviser at the Department for Education, said it was “astonishing” that the government’s levelling up plans “include a policy that, by definition, will only benefit a tiny number of pupils”. He pointed to research showing that selective schools have no overall impact on attainment levels in particular areas, adding that Eton should have instead shared its resources to all schools in Oldham, Middlesbrough and Dudley rather than “locking away their supposed expertise in a very small number of schools to benefit only a very, very small number of pupils”. Darren Hankey, the principal of Hartlepool College of Further Education, said he was concerned that the plans would have a “detrimental effect” on other schools and colleges in those areas who would lose students and staff. He said ministers should instead better fund the existing providers, including school sixth-forms where per pupil funding has been slashed by 25% in real terms since 2010, adding that opening new institutions seemed to contradict government policy to shrink the higher education field. Another school leader in one of the chosen areas, who did not want to be named, said teachers were “perplexed, upset and angry”. “If you said what’s top of my list for improving opportunities for children here, I would have got to 99 and still not mentioned a new sixth form.”",News/Education,Headteacher defends plan for free ‘Etons of the north’ sixth forms,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/21/headteacher-defends-plan-for-free-etons-of-the-north-sixth-forms
3/21/2022,"As more and more people return to the workplace in person, there’s a lot to be unenthusiastic about – micromanaging bosses, hellish commutes, that one colleague you just can’t stand. There’s also the bane of women in the workplace: heels. Women have long bemoaned the unfair and sexist norms that require many of us to wear heels at the office – from the physical discomfort of having to work in stilettos for hours, to the misogynistic tropes that get projected on to women who wear high heels, especially in male-dominated spaces. Finally, though, there’s new research to validate those experiences. To find out how heels really affect women’s careers, University of North Carolina professor Sreedhari Desai and her team conducted a series of studies looking at how people evaluated women in a variety of work settings. These scenarios included leading a class, giving a presentation, interviewing for a job, and taking part in a negotiation, with the only variable being whether the woman was wearing high heels or flats. The results? Women wearing flats were deemed more capable and prepared, and earned higher evaluations from both men and women in their 20s through their 50s. There’s truly no winning. On the one hand, women working in corporate jobs, retail and the hospitality industry are often required to wear heels as part of their dress code. It’s a norm that’s built on centuries of dressing women according to the male gaze, and forcing them to subscribe to misogynistic standards of femininity. But, as the study proves, women in heels are also taken far less seriously at work than women who wear flats. Even outside the workplace, the choice to wear high heels continues to be loaded with cultural and political baggage. Women are simultaneously sexualized, thought of as powerful, and dismissed – all based on how we choose to protect our feet from the elements. And for as long as women have known that they were being treated differently because of the kind of shoes they wear, questions of gender discrimination based on clothing have been dismissed as inane and superficial. Desai is right when she describes her research into heels as “a keyhole … through which we can examine the broader issue of how gender inequality is created or re-created and maintained over time in organizations”. Heels can work to both highlight and deepen workplace gender inequities, and are just one of the many ways that women at work are stripped of agency over their own bodies. In a now infamous 2016 example, London-based Nicola Thorp was sent home without pay from her job at PricewaterhouseCoopers for refusing to wear two- to four-inch heels in compliance with the company’s dress code for female employees. The incident sparked outrage across the globe, and reignited conversations about gender-based dress codes and how harmful they can be. PwC has since changed its policy, but the legacy of that incident coupled with research like Desai’s is crucial – not only because they affirm what women have always known anecdotally, but because they help provide a starting point for how to actually deal with this issue at a systemic level. Thorp’s case led to a British House of Commons petition that would make it illegal to require women to wear heels to work, and in recent years governments around the world are taking a hard second look at what employers have been allowed to enforce when it comes to dress codes. So does this mean the days of high heels at work are finally coming to an end? Well, it’s clear the tide is already shifting. And as the pandemic gives us more and more reasons to reckon with the nature of our relationship to work, we can look forward to the day when women can show up to work and be assessed on the merit of their work, not how they were dressed that day.

3/21/2022,"Three years have passed since 17-year-old Yousef Makki was killed on a suburban Manchester street, but for his sister Jade Akoum, he remains a constant presence. At her home in Burnage, a portrait of Yousef has pride of place on the living room wall; her youngest son, now 18 months old, was named after him. On the last anniversary of his death, the family set up a foundation in Yousef’s name, to provide financial support for other local working-class boys with dreams like his. And thoughts of her brother consume Akoum’s every waking hour. A lengthy murder trial has already come and gone, but, like the inquest that followed, Akoum believes it raised more questions than it answered. “We feel fed up with the system,” she says, a numbness to her voice. “I don’t trust any more. I don’t have faith in the police, in the courts. The idea that we’re all equal and are treated the same regardless of class and money? I’m naive to have believed it.” It’s a grey March morning and Akoum is sitting on her sofa, tea in hand, with Mazen, her husband of 14 years, while their toddler pops in and out of the room. Yet again, she finds herself going over the circumstances surrounding her brother’s death: how he was stabbed on the evening of 2 March 2019 and the series of events that followed, which she feels resulted in a string of prosecution and police failures. At the inquest last November, the coroner announced that the circumstances of Yousef’s death were so unclear she couldn’t even deliver an open verdict. “Sometimes, I don’t mind talking about it at all – it’s like I need to,” Akoum says. “Other days I can’t face it and really struggle.” But it is a burden she has to shoulder. On Monday, Killed By a Rich Kid – a Channel 4 documentary two years in the making – will bring the story of Yousef’s death back into the public eye. When the documentary team got in touch, she didn’t hesitate about taking part. “It was our only way of getting someone to really investigate, with proper resources, what happened.” Akoum, Yousef and their two siblings grew up just down the road from where she lives today. They were a tight-knit family. While Akoum was 11 years Yousef’s senior, their bond was precious. “I mothered him quite a lot,” she says, “always lecturing him and telling him what to do. Yousef was an amazing child – he was about three when we noticed he wasn’t like most other kids. He was mature for his age, always thinking of others.” Yousef was sporty and academic, and teachers at his state primary school believed he would thrive at one of Manchester’s competitive – and expensive – independent schools. “We come from a working-class area,” says Akoum. “None of us had been to them, we knew so little about them. We were all so hopeful for him.” Their mum, Debbie, didn’t believe Yousef could pull it off. “They made a deal,” Akoum says with a brief smile. “If Yousef got into one of those schools, she’d find the money to pay for a fancy car to pick him and his friends up on their final day of primary.” Sure enough, Yousef and his classmates clambered into a chauffeur-driven limousine at the end of summer term. He had been awarded a full scholarship to the prestigious Manchester Grammar school. It may have been just a couple of miles down the road from the family home, but with fees of more than £13,000 a year it was a world away; without a full bursary, it would never have been possible. Still, finding the money to pay for the uniform and other trappings was far from easy. “We got to know Paul the loan man pretty well,” Akoum says. “He’d come round collecting the debts he was owed. But Mum never let it faze her.” This was an investment in Yousef’s future. The plan was to study medicine, with talk of Oxbridge. Yousef spent the evening of 1 March 2019 training at his boxing club. The next morning, he woke up feeling unwell; his mum said he could spend the day in bed recovering. “I think he just fancied a day at home,” says Akoum, “because, by lunchtime, he was asking to take one of my kids for a walk to the shops.” It’s a fair reflection of Yousef, Akoum believes, that he saw equal value in his education and being an uncle. “Later in the afternoon, Yousef asked to go on a bike ride with a friend. He had a shower, caught the tram and said goodbye. That was the last time I saw him.” Yousef had arranged to spend the night at the home of a schoolfriend, Adam Chowdhary, in the affluent Hale Barnes suburb. The boys had been close since year 7; their parents had spoken to confirm the arrangements. That evening, Akoum was putting her kids to bed when her phone rang. Her mum was calling. All she said, clearly in a state of distress, was: “Get down to the hospital.” The following afternoon, Akoum stood in a freezing mortuary, confronted by the body of her “invincible” brother. “I wanted to hug him and to hold his hand, but they told me I could only touch his face,” Akoum recalls, “because there was ‘an ongoing murder investigation’.” Only then did she start to question what had happened. “His hair was gelled just as he liked it. I kept expecting him to jump up and say: ‘Surprise! I tricked you’ … But he didn’t.” Just 15 weeks later, a trial began at Manchester crown court. To the family – with no experience of the justice system – it felt a surprisingly short window between alleged crime and prosecution. Asked to comment, the Crown Prosecution Service stated: “As is common practice with cases involving youths, the court decided this trial should take place as soon as possible. We ensured the case was in the strongest position ahead of the trial.” In the dock were two friends of Yousef’s, both of whom were then still 17. The first was Josh Molnar, charged with murder, perverting the course of justice, possession of a bladed article and conspiracy to rob. The other? Adam Chowdhary, the friend from the sleepover, charged with the same offences except murder. Both boys came from wealthy families; they were defended by three senior QCs and a well-respected junior. Akoum says the family had been instructed by the authorities not to speak to the press or to make public statements. “I remember snippets of the case starting,” she says. “The police saying the boys had gone to buy cannabis; that Molnar had been beaten up for some reason by some other lads. And then there’d been some tension between these three boys in the aftermath, which somehow had led to Yousef’s stabbing.” Memories of the three-week trial aren’t just blurred because of the long and agonising days. After the first day, Yousef’s loved ones were told to sit upstairs in the public gallery. It meant they could barely keep track of what was happening. “My mum was disabled. Yousef’s dad has a bad back and uses crutches, so they struggled to make it up there,” says Akoum. “We couldn’t hear or see anything, either.” The court gave family, friends and teachers only three headsets to share to listen in with. “We complained every day, but nobody took any notice.” “It was the first time we’d felt let down by the justice system,” says Akoum, “but we’d been assured by the police and CPS that the case was solid and they’d succeed.” The location where Yousef had been stabbed was in a CCTV blank spot, and the prosecution case, as Akoum understands it now, hinged on a complex narrative that these three boys had indulged themselves in a gangster fantasy, ordered flick-knives online and plotted a robbery at a low-value drug deal. Prosecution lawyers alleged that once the plan failed, Molnar became angry and attacked Yousef. The defence, meanwhile, claimed that Yousef was the aggressor, and that when Molnar stabbed him in the heart, he was acting in self-defence. “It felt like both sides were attacking Yousef’s character to sell their own version of events,” Akoum says. (Because Molnar’s case was that he acted in self-defence, the judge allowed his legal team to present “bad character” evidence about Yousef.) “But the picture they painted wasn’t one anybody who knew him recognised.” Something didn’t add up, she felt. “Yousef was presented as this aggressive, knife-wielding working-class lad with a temper amid two wealthy boys from good families, which just wasn’t true. We expected it from the defence, but I didn’t understand why the prosecution was trying to tarnish him. “We asked if we could submit a character reference about Yousef to the court,” Akoum continues. “We wanted to show the real Yousef to the jury. The school offered to write one – one of us could, too – but we were told, no, you can’t do that for the deceased. It felt so unreasonable.” On 12 July, both defendants were convicted of being in possession of a bladed article; Molnar alone of perverting the course of justice. Molnar was sentenced to a 16-month detention and training order, while Chowdhary was given a four-month detention order. When it came to the murder and manslaughter charges, however, the jury found Molnar not guilty. “The foreperson stood up,” says Akoum, “and I just heard all these not-guilty responses. The room spun; we were in shock. Dad shouted: ‘There’s no justice for my son’ before collapsing.” Even now, she struggles to believe it. “The whole way through the trial we’d been told not to speak to the press,” says Akoum. “Not to give our side of Yousef’s story. Then, as soon as the trial was over – which we could barely understand – it was like the story had already been decided. But I knew it wasn’t the truth. I was certain. First Yousef was killed, then his character was trashed.” In the years since Yousef’s death, the family, and the support base they have built up, have tirelessly campaigned to expose what they believe to be a miscarriage of justice. They argue it was a consequence of poor decision-making and inequalities in the legal system. They allege there were a number of identifiable failures in the way the prosecution was handled – not least that the “botched drug deal” may never have happened. As the head of Greater Manchester police’s (GMP) major crime review unit, Martin Bottomley, put it at the inquest, his “firm view” was that the incident that preceded that stabbing was “not a drug deal gone wrong” but a “revenge attack” on Molnar. An internal report by GMP, which has been seen by the Guardian, found further problems with the investigation. According to the report, gaps in intelligence were left unfilled and inconsistencies in some witness statements were not fully explored. This was a complex murder investigation being conducted in a short period of time, yet GMP’s major incident support unit was not engaged to work on it. Unusually, given the seriousness of the charges, Molnar was granted bail. And, after the police were called to the crime scene, only one of the two boys present was initially detained, despite – as the Channel 4 film highlights – inconsistencies in their initial accounts. For two and a half hours, Chowdhary was left unsupervised by police before he was arrested, during which time mobile phone data was deleted. As the report states: “There is no way to know what material had been deleted from [his] phone and was unable to be recovered.” A spokesperson for GMP told the Guardian that while the review raised “learning points, mainly in relation to internal practices, [it] concluded that there was nothing the investigation team could have done differently which would have necessarily affected the outcome of the trial”. As the inquest verdict has been referred for judicial review, GMP stated it would be “inappropriate to comment on specific details”. In April 2020, the Independent Office for Police Conduct dropped its own investigation into the GMP’s handling of the case after finding no evidence of “potential misconduct by any individual officer”. “We tried to appeal the sentences,” says Akoum, “but it didn’t happen. There was also talk of trying to fundraise for a private prosecution through a civil case.” But they were told they would need £100,000 to proceed. “If we’d been rich, we might have been able to do it.” It was only with the help of a lawyer acting pro bono that an inquest was ultimately granted. At the inquest last November, the coroner recorded a narrative verdict, finding that Yousef died from “complications from a stab wound the precise circumstances of which cannot, on the balance of probabilities, be ascertained”. She said she could not, on the balance of probabilities, conclude his death was unlawful killing, accidental death or misadventure, or even deliver an open verdict. After the inquest, a statement issued on Molnar’s behalf by his solicitors said the conclusion was “consistent with the evidence and the verdict of the jury”, adding: “Josh has accepted responsibility for his involvement in Yousef’s death. His remorse is genuine and heartfelt. He will live with this for the rest of his life. This was a truly tragic incident between friends.” Akoum and the family’s legal team, however, have requested a judicial review of the coroner’s conclusion, not in the hope of seeing Molnar and Chowdhary’s sentences – now served – extended, but to clear Yousef’s name. And they hope to highlight how the justice system favours those with cash, whether defendants or victims. “Class played such a big part in what has happened,” argues Akoum. “These were rich families who had money for the best lawyers, suits and publicists. If Yousef had been the one accused, we couldn’t have paid for an expensive lawyer. We just know he’d have been found guilty.” Had the tables been turned, Akoum argues, Yousef would never have had the privilege of being seen as a promising young man caught up in a tragic accident. “We understand [Yousef’s family] are frustrated about the outcome of the trial,” the CPS says. “While we did everything we could to secure a murder conviction, we respect the jury’s verdict.” “Even if this is painful, I don’t want to one day look back and regret not doing more,” says Akoum. “I know that if I don’t carry on I’ll feel guilty for ever. That’s not something I can live with.” Killed By a Rich Kid is on Channel 4 at 9pm on 21 March.",News/UK news,‘Some days I really struggle’: Jade Akoum on the killing of her schoolboy brother,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/some-days-i-really-struggle-jade-akoum-on-the-killing-of-her-schoolboy-brother-yousef-makki
3/21/2022,"Mercury contamination is widespread among skin lightening and anti-ageing creams sold on online platforms like eBay, Alibaba and Amazon, a new analysis of hundreds of products has found. The Zero Mercury Working Group (ZMWG) tested 271 products bought in 15 countries over a 13-month period and found nearly half to be contaminated with the dangerous heavy metal at levels above 1 part per million (ppm), the legal limit in the US. The EU, meanwhile, doesn’t allow any mercury in cosmetics. “It’s really concerning that these online manufacturers continue to sell and flaunt and profit from illegal products that are doing significant damage to consumers,” said Michael Bender, international coordinator with the Mercury Policy Project. Mercury is used as a skin whitening agent because it blocks production of melanin, which gives color to skin, and it can be used to remove spots, freckles, blemishes and wrinkles. Some analysts expect skin lightening product sales to reach nearly $12bn globally by 2026, ZMWG said. Mercury poisoning can cause significant injury, including rashes, kidney disease and nervous system damage. In 2019, a California woman who used mercury- contaminated skin lightening products slipped into a coma. ZMWG, which is an international coalition of more than 110 public health advocacy groups, detected levels as high as 65,000ppm. “We’re not finding 1ppm – we’re finding products that are hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of times above [1ppm],” Bender said. “These levels are astronomical.” Most of the contaminated products were not made by large American or European brands, but were found in Pakistani, Mexican, Chinese and Thai brands that are sometimes popular in those regions. The most recent analysis builds on three previous rounds of testing by ZMWG. After previous tests, some brands allegedly pulled contaminated batches from shelves, but the most recent study revealed many of the same companies were still selling mercury-contaminated products. “Seeing the high result is like ‘here we go again’, because it’s the same brands over and over again,” said Elena Lymberidi-Settimo, international co-coordinator with ZMWG. In some cases, the products are simply made in someone’s home, she added, so it’s difficult for authorities to find the operation and shut it down. In a statement to the Guardian, Amazon said it removed the products in question, and it has put “proactive measures in place to prevent suspicious or non-compliant products from being listed”. The report comes as public health advocates and e-commerce platforms battle over liability. Companies like Amazon have generally claimed that third-party vendors who use its site are responsible for the product’s safety, because Amazon and similar companies merely provide a platform. The companies are “evading responsibility”, Bender said. “They knowingly profit from the illegal trade of highly toxic products,” he charged. That question is playing out in court in California, where a suit against Amazon alleged the company violated the Toxic Enforcement Act, or Proposition 65, because it sold skin lightening creams contaminated with mercury. A lower court sided with Amazon, but the California court of appeals ruled last week that the company must warn consumers when they or their third-party vendors are selling mercury-contaminated products, or other goods with some dangerous toxins. Bender called it a victory that marked a shift in case law away from shielding e-commerce sites from liability, but he noted the ruling affects only products sold in California when national and global strategies are needed. “These individual court cases aren’t going to solve these problems,” Bender added. The US Food and Drug Administration late last year issued an import warning on skin lightening products, but advocates say the agency has limited authority and resources. The Environmental Working Group, which is part of the ZMWG coalition, noted the cosmetics section of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was last updated in 1938, and should be modernized. Perhaps the most promising development is the Minamata Convention, a recent global treaty in which signatories must ban the manufacture, import or export of cosmetics with more than 1ppm of mercury. “That is the gamechanger,” Bender said. “We really need international cooperation.”",News/Society,Mercury found in skin lightening and anti-ageing creams sold online – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/21/skin-lightening-anti-ageing-creams-mercury-contamination-study
3/21/2022,"Weep you no more, sad fountains Weep you no more, sad fountains;What need you flow so fast?Look how the snowy mountainsHeaven’s sun doth gently waste.But my sun’s heavenly eyesView not your weeping,That now lie sleepingSoftly, now softly liesSleeping. Sleep is a reconciling,A rest that peace begets.Doth not the sun rise smilingWhen fair at even he sets?Rest you then, rest, sad eyes,Melt not in weepingWhile she lies sleepingSoftly, now softly liesSleeping. This week’s poem is from The Third and Last Book of Songs or Aires by John Dowland (1563-1626), Elizabeth I’s court musician. It’s been suggested that the song alluded to the queen, who, after increasingly poor health, died in 1603, the year of the book’s publication. Obituaries are written in advance, so why not an elegy? And perhaps some would argue it’s not an elegy at all, but a lullaby in praise of sleep. Whatever its origins, Dowland’s song seems charged with personal emotion. Three challenges are directed to the “sad fountains” at the start of the first verse: the fountains are told to “weep no more”, questioned as to why they need to “flow so fast”, and, in consequence, asked to turn their attention to the melting snow on the mountains. The fountains are not, I think, to be taken literally. The singer-lover is addressing his own grief in the form of his own weeping eyes. The questions surrounding this “conceit” help build its artistry. The imagery of the sun “[that] doth gently waste” the snowy mountains, and the rapid streams of snow-melt, deflects the speaker from self-absorption. “Heaven’s sun” is a destroyer but a “gentle” and necessary one: the picture presented is, after all, that of the spring thaw. The rhetorical device is meant to question the need for any competition from human tears, but these lines present the mountains, the sun and the pouring streams, as if the writer could see them. The conceits serve the poem by heightening metaphorical possibilities and emotional connections. Cleverly, after the naturalism of lines three and four, the sun is reborn to human identity and intimacy with the speaker: “my sun’s heavenly eyes”. The play on words (“Heaven’s sun”, “my sun’s heavenly eyes”) performs a beautiful figure, which may also be part of a larger revision to a tired convention. The eyes of the mistress often have the power to destroy poetic suitors. Here, pathos intensifies because the woman’s eyes are closed in sleep, oblivious to the overflowing eyes of her lover. There’s no cruelty from her, no request from him for her pity: she remains asleep, so “softly” perhaps, that she no longer stirs at all. The second verse continues the lover’s argument with himself, but in a different key. The diction at first is somewhat abstract, wonderfully nuanced but perhaps more a matter of received wisdom than it was earlier: “Sleep is a reconciling, / A rest that peace begets.” There seems little doubt that the poet, as before, is talking about death, not sleep. A muted Christian analogy with resurrection underlies the rhetorical flourish, “Doth not the sun rise smiling / When fair at even he sets?” Mourning, it seems, is un-Christian. The repentant dead are at peace in a more heavenly and sun-like place. The mourner’s tears are wasted snow-melt, and, implicitly, selfish. In each verse, the last two lines of the refrain bring about a shift of rhythm, a pulse fading from four beats to one. This rhythm, on the page, is more interesting than the language itself: “softly, now softly lies / sleeping”). It suggests that the composer or singer is being offered an opportunity for personal embellishment. Otherwise, from the metaphorical ingenuity of the first verse to the subtle reprise, in the last, of the opening themes and images, this song surely has the power to stand alone as a poem. It has a complex life on the page, and, by words alone, creates that indispensable “voice” that is heard only inside a reader’s head.",Arts/Books,"Poem of the week: Weep you no more, sad fountains by John Dowland",https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/mar/21/poem-of-the-week-weep-you-no-more-sad-fountains-by-john-dowland
3/21/2022,"Hong Kong will lift a ban on flights from nine countries and reduce hotel quarantine alongside a “roadmap” towards eased restrictions that suggest a departure from the territory’s zero-Covid policy, its leader has announced. From 1 April, fully vaccinated Hong Kong residents who have received a negative PCR test will be allowed to enter on flights from the UK, Australia, Canada, France, India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and the US. Arrivals have to undergo seven days’ hotel quarantine, down from 14 previously. The “circuit breaker flight ban” was no longer necessary for those nine countries because the situations there were “no worse” than that in Hong Kong, the chief executive, Carrie Lam, told the media on Monday, acknowledging the anxiety restrictions had caused to Hongkongers stranded overseas. Hong Kong has maintained some of the world’s strictest border rules, blocking non-residents from entry, enforcing 21-day quarantines, and punitively banning airlines for carrying Covid-positive passengers. Lam also announced social restrictions on gathering limits, mask-wearing, and business and venue operations would begin easing in three phases from 20 April. Schools will resume face-to-face classes from 19 April, and plans for a controversial mandatory mass testing rollout were suspended, citing advice from mainland experts. Lam emphasised the roadmap was subject to change, but ruled out anything being relaxed earlier than stated. “People may be desensitised to Covid positive numbers,” she said. “I would urge the members of the public to be more patient with this timetable and roadmap. As long as the trend is coming down in four weeks’ time we should be able to resume normal life.” The roadmap echoes those put in place by other countries as they transitioned away from harsh restrictions to living with the virus, often after being overwhelmed by an Omicron outbreak. Hong Kong has been committed to a “dynamic zero” policy of eliminating each outbreak as it occurs, but had begun introducing mitigation strategies as infections and fatalities rose. On Monday, Lam would not say if her announcement was an admission that Hong Kong would have to live with the virus, telling reporters not to “draw any conclusions”. Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney, said the new policy setting “does look as though it’s signalling to move away from a Covid- zero or a dynamic-zero aim”. Prof Martiniuk said no country so far had experienced a large Omicron wave and completely contained it. “Covid-zero becomes extremely difficult to maintain once it’s out of the bag in a large way,” she said. “Keeping public health protections in place but letting go of the concept of Covid-zero does sound like where Hong Kong is going.” The government of mainland China – which is also battling its own, smaller Omicron outbreak – has previously said Hong Kong must maintain a Covid-zero policy before it would reopen the border between them. Hong Kong’s government had prioritised reopening to the mainland over the rest of the world, but on Monday, Lam said Hong Kong would always have to take into account “connectivity with the outside world” as well as with the mainland. Health authorities say the city is past the peak of an Omicron outbreak that infected at least 1 million people, but potentially half the population, overwhelming hospitals. More than 5,000 people have died. The government did not put the city under lockdown, but instead introduced or reintroduced a range of social restrictions, including some that sparked confusion and frustrating, such as the closure of beaches. The restrictions have put pressure on residents, who are leaving in droves. Net departures have surpassed 54,000 for this month, after 71,000 in February, Reuters reported. Kenneth Tang, a 24-year old project executive, said he and his friends had grown frustrated and sometimes very distressed under Hong Kong’s restrictions and the devastating outbreak. “The impact in my personal life is serious, the psychological impact has affected my body. Hongkongers have to find ways to save themselves,” he said. “I think we should take references from other countries. It’s not possible to have Covid zero now,” he said. “So we should see what the UK, Australia, and Canada do. We can do a similar solution to them. I think it is very important to lift the flight bans, and they should help to maintain our mental health as soon as possible.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin and Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,Hong Kong eases travel rules in apparent shift from zero-Covid policy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/hong-kong-eases-covid-travel-rules
3/21/2022,"There is “no particular cause for concern” about the UK’s rapidly rising number of Covid cases, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has said, saying that England was demonstrating to the world a successful model for living with the virus. Despite survey data showing almost 5% of the population in England had Covid earlier this month, and record infection levels among the over-70s, Javid said the “wall of defence” from vaccines was keeping the situation stable. From Monday, 5 million people across England at higher risk from Covid – the over-75s, care home residents and those who are immunocompromised – will be able to book a second booster jab in the coming weeks. Javid confirmed that a wider booster programme, most likely aimed at the over-50s, was expected in the autumn. “Our level of concern hasn’t changed,” Javid told BBC1’s Breakfast programme. “Although the case numbers are rising, infections are rising, and indeed hospital numbers are rising, they are still way below their peak. “It’s also important for us when we review this to understand why they are rising. And that is primarily down to the increased social mixing we are seeing, as our country has opened up, but also the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron, which we know is, on the one hand more infectious, but on the other hand we know that our vaccines work just as well against this. “Taking all that into account, of course we keep the data under review, but there’s no particular cause for concern at this point.” Asked about the case numbers in a later interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Javid said that while 11,500 people in hospital in England had Covid, 60% of these were being treated for non-Covid reasons. “There’s no particular cause for concern at this point,” he said. “The reason why things are stable and we are learning to live with Covid is because of our vaccine wall of defence.” There is particular concern about the scale of infections in older people, while school leaders fear preparations for A-levels and GCSEs are being disrupted by outbreaks among staff and students. The ongoing Office for National Statistics Covid survey, based on swab tests taken in the community, found that almost 5% of the population in England had Covid in the week ending 12 March, including 3.5% of people in the oldest age group. The high prevalence among older people has prompted unease, after reports this week that vaccine immunity declines steeply in care-home residents. It is six months since many people in this age group had their last vaccine dose. Javid dismissed the idea of complacency. He said: “For anyone to suggest that the government or our advisers are unbothered would be clearly wrong. We have a plan for how, as a country, we learn to live with Covid, and that plan is working.” England was, he added, “successfully showing the world” how to live with the virus. While free Covid testing for most people will end in April, Javid said the ONS survey and similar ongoing studies, such as one based in care homes, would help track the progress of the virus. He said: “Because of that we will still have excellent data on a very regular basis about what is going on with the virus in the country. But the one thing that we will remain focused on is the the vaccination programme.”",News/World news,"UK Covid case numbers ‘no particular cause for concern’, says Javid ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/uk-covid-case-numbers-no-particular-cause-for-concern-says-javid
3/21/2022,"As dawn creeps over the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia, a small group of children trek downhill carrying cameras and sketch pads. Each month, they come to an ancient site scattered with hundreds of petroglyphs – smooth stones etched with patterns – to create their own images of the art of their ancestors. The project is run by the public library in Atánquez, a tranquil mountainside town of 10,000 people in the Kankuamo indigenous reserve. Atánquez, the capital of the Kankuamo people, surrounded by the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Atánquez’s Kankuaka library is more than just a space to house books, it is the centre of the indigenous people’s initiatives to preserve their history and strengthen their identity. A pavilion and mud-brick round houses behind the main building host community gatherings. Youth activities include the petroglyph outings, photography workshops and gatherings with tribal elders. “[The rock carvings] are memories of the ancestors,” says Mariham Martinez Daza, seven, who is part of the programme. “They’re beautiful.” Petroglyphs near Atánquez. Children visit the stones as part of a cultural recovery project Sahian Maestre, 13, adds: “They show us as another part of who we are. They tell us about the past and explain how indigenous people saw things. It is also another way of seeing each other, and how our ancestors believed each one of us is connected.” But her favourite trips are those to meet Kankuamo elders, to learn about traditional music, recipes and how people have changed over the years. One early project of the library had children collecting stories from their grandparents and adapting them into stop-motion videos. Top: people sit around the fire in a kankurua, a Kankuamo ceremonial centre, where the community share their thoughts. Above: Souldes Maestre, who helped found the library in Atánquez “For us, it is essential that certain memories cannot be transmitted if it is not orally,” says Souldes Maestre, the librarian and one of the library’s founders. Legends are meant to be told, not just read in books, he says. “We want the children to begin to create an interest in knowing, in asking questions.”In February 2013, Atánquez had just a box of unopened books sent by the National Network of Public Libraries. When a group of young people found out that a government official was due to come and remove them because of disuse, they decided to act. They peeled off the plastic wrappings and hastily arranged the books in an abandoned community building. The official was sceptical of this “library”. But, Maestre says, they told her: “If we are capable of putting this together in one night, you cannot imagine what we are capable of in a year.” The official gave them a year, as well as tables and chairs, and new books arrived. In 2015, Atánquez was a finalist for Colombia’s national library award, winning it in 2017. Clockwise from top: a street in Atánquez; children draw petroglyphs discovered on an earlier morning visit; a bust believed to be of Simón Bolívar; Marian Leonor Martinez, seven, reads in a hammock at the library Patrick Morales, coordinator of ethnic affairs at the National Centre for Historical Memory in Colombia, says the Kankuamo story is symbolic of Latin America’s indigenous people, many of whom attempted to assimilate in the 1950s and 1960s, and then returned to their roots. But the Kankuaka library is unique in its focus on audiovisual narratives and intergenerational exchanges. “The Kankuamo are very committed to working with boys and girls, because for them they are the heirs of this fight for memory,” says Morales. During the pandemic, they gave tape recorders to children to record interviews with family, handed out seeds and bought groceries for families in need. Vaccines were even administered at the library. There are about 35,000 Kankuamo, 28,000 of whom live on the reserve, and they are one of the four indigenous groups of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Like many other indigenous people, their culture is threatened by modernisation and conflict. Violence from guerrilla and paramilitary groups in the 1980s and 1990s killed, orphaned and displaced hundreds, separated families, and targeted leaders and religious authorities. For years, being Kankuamo was seen as shameful and many people tried to distance themselves from their culture, but the early 1990s saw a change. “Little by little our people are falling in love and valuing what they are as indigenous peoples,” says Ener Crispin Cáceres, a Kankuamo elder. Clockwise from top left: Ener Crispin Cáceres, a Kankuamo elder, uses a poporó to meditate; Cáceres mixes ambil, a paste made from cooked tobacco leaves, with the leaves of anyu (coca) to use his poporó; children play traditional instruments in Kankuamo dress; a kankurua built at the back of the library. The national and international recognition the library has gained has brought in prize money to keep it afloat, but organisers are trying to raise funds to buy computers. John Robert Torres Maestre, the former cabildo, or chief of Atánquez, helped get the library off the ground. He says that 40 years ago, a generation went off to university never to return, which is why it is so important to cultivate a love of learning alongside a love of heritage, so that those who pursue higher education come back. A mural at the back of the library reads, ‘Kankuamos, united for ancestral memory’ This identity is increasingly important as the region faces threats from proposed coal, coltan and oil mining projects nearby that would damage land and poison rivers. For Maestre, there is a clear link between the library’s work and the community’s ability to defend itself. Seteyuman, a traditional place of passage and entrance to the Kankuamo territory “For us, the concept of memory is not like a museum, something that can be seen, but rather represents survival,” says Maestre “If we do not have that memory, if we do not have those stories, we cannot continue to be Kankuamos.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘Legends are to be told’: Colombian library goes beyond books to keep stories alive,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/21/legends-are-to-be-told-colombian-library-goes-beyond-books-to-keep-stories-alive
3/21/2022,"The war in Ukraine risks putting global targets on the climate out of reach, the UN secretary general has warned, if countries respond to Russia’s aggression by increasing their use of fossil fuels. António Guterres said the aim of limiting global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the goal set out at the Cop26 UN climate summit last year, was in peril as countries sought alternatives to Russian oil and gas supplies. “The fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine risks upending global food and energy markets, with major implications for the global climate agenda. As major economies pursue an ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to replace Russian fossil fuels, short-term measures might create long-term fossil fuel dependence and close the window to 1.5C,” he warned, in a video address to a conference on sustainability run by the Economist newspaper in London on Monday. “Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use,” he went on. “This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.” Europe is dependent on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany’s reliance even higher at 60%. The EU is embarking on a plan to cut its use of Russian gas by two-thirds this year, and eliminate it in future years. As part of that plan, as well as expanding renewable energy generation, EU member states are seeking fossil fuels from other nations, such as gas from Qatar and oil from Saudi Arabia. Some may also consider an increase in coal-fired power generation. In the UK the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is considering a cut in fuel duty, to offset some of the price increases that have taken petrol near record highs. Critics warned such a cut would have little impact on poorer households. Guterres said turning to fossil fuels would only store up further problems. “As current events make all too clear, our continuing reliance on fossil fuels puts the global economy and energy security at the mercy of geopolitical shocks and crises,” he said. “Instead of hitting the brakes on the decarbonisation of the global economy, now is the time to put the pedal to the metal towards a renewable energy future.” The UN secretary general acknowledged widespread concern among climate experts that the progress on display at the Cop26 summit was in danger of dissipating under the pressure of soaring energy prices and greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency found that annual carbon dioxide emissions from energy jumped by 6% last year to their highest levels in history, as economies rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic. The “green recovery” that many governments promised from the crisis has not materialised. Guterres warned: “If we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5C goodbye. Even 2C may be out of reach. That would be catastrophe.”",News/Environment,"Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/ukraine-war-threatens-global-heating-goals-warns-un-chief
3/21/2022,"An alleged gang rape in broad daylight has shone a harsh spotlight on the pervasiveness of rape culture in Argentina and prompted fresh calls for men to play a bigger role in the country’s battle against gender violence. The assault of a 20-year-old woman by six men allegedly happened on a holiday Monday afternoon in February, in a parked car in Palermo, one of Buenos Aires’ busiest neighbourhoods. Two men kept watch outside, strumming a guitar in an apparent attempt to conceal the attack, as four others allegedly took turns assaulting the woman in the vehicle. A couple came to the young woman’s rescue, and a crowd formed afterwards, screaming insults at the men who sat handcuffed next to a police cruiser. All six, aged between 20 and 24, are charged with rape, aggravated by the involvement of two or more people. Two have denied the allegations, but all remain in custody and a court has placed an embargo on their assets. Argentina is at the forefront of Latin America’s trans feminist movement: it legalized abortion in 2020 and has introduced a raft of government policies aimed at eradicating gender-based violence. But cis and trans femicide rates are still shockingly high, with about one woman killed every 30 hours. Like a notorious assault in Pamplona, Spain, by a group of men who called themselves “the wolfpack”, the Palermo case has sparked a national debate with intense discussion of the way rape is habitually described as an isolated act rather than a reflection of broader society. “It’s your brother, your neighbour, your father, your son, your friend, your colleague at work,” Elizabeth Gómez Alcorta, Argentina’s minister of women, gender and diversity, declared in a tweet following the attack. “It’s not a beast, it’s not an animal, it’s not a pack with unstoppable instincts. None of the acts that horrify us are isolated. Everyone responds to the same cultural matrix,” said Alcorta. “We need men to be part of the [feminist] struggle.” Members of the political opposition attacked Alcorta, saying she was painting wide swaths of society as rapists – with some even suggesting that such framing justified those who commit abhorrent crimes. Luciano Fabbri, president of the Institute of Masculinities and Social Change, said there was still an inclination to see these cases as an exception from the norm, rather than a reflection of the way men are socialized to accept that violence and feel entitled to women, their bodies and their time. “Just because we don’t kill or rape doesn’t mean that we don’t have a responsibility for the societal change that the women’s movement is pushing for,” said Fabbri. “We have to figure out how we are still participating – through omission or complicity – in those power relations that legitimize gender violence.” At a protest in Buenos Aires after the Palermo assault, the indignation was palpable. “I’m fed up. I’m tired,” said Ornella Michetti, a teacher. “There’s this feeling that despite all the effort we have put into this, it’s just not enough.” Nadia Vega, a vegan food vendor at the march, said: “It’s horrible that this keeps happening and that we have to keep telling [men]: don’t give us flowers, start talking about this with your friends.” For Magdalena Morgenstern, the Palermo attack triggered an uncomfortable conversation with her partner, who revealed he had gone to school with one of the accused and stayed silent when he acted improperly with women. “I have a father and boyfriend who have micro-machismos and I love them a lot. So I feel conflicted about that, obviously,” said Morgenstern, 19. “And while we’re all in this process of breaking down who we are, rapes and femicides keep happening.” Adriana Morgenstern, her mother, saw such discussions as a sign of progress. “I think about myself at her age, and who I am years later and how I went changing and positioning myself according to my own rights. It’s a collective construction. We are transforming together.”",News/World news,Alleged gang rape in Argentina fuels calls for men to fight gender violence,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/argentina-gang-rape-allegation-feminism-men
