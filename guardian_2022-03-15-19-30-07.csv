3/15/2022,"The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia are travelling to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv even as pre-dawn Russian shelling killed more civilians in an apartment building in Ukraine’s capital. In statements from their respective capitals, the three leaders said they would be offering their support to Ukraine’s president as representatives of the other 24 EU heads of state and government. The move by Poland’s Mateusz Morawiecki, his Czech counterpart, Petr Fiala, and Slovenia’s Janez Janša was said to be an attempt to bolster Ukraine in its fight for its sovereignty. They will also meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Fiala tweeted: “The aim of the visit is to express the European Union’s unequivocal support for Ukraine and its freedom and independence. “At the same time, we will present a broad package of support for Ukraine and its citizens during the visit. The international community has also been informed of this visit by international organisations, including the United Nations.” The announcement came as the emergency services in Kyiv said said two people had died in an attack on a 15-storey apartment building shortly before dawn on Tuesday. A downtown subway station that had been used as a bomb shelter was also damaged. City authorities tweeted an image of its blown-out facade. Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February but the Russian military has been gradually encircling the capital. The Polish government said the visit by the three EU leaders to Ukraine and its capital was being made in agreement with the presidents of the European Commission and Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel. EU leaders met in Versailles on Thursday and Friday last week to discuss further ways to pile pressure on Vladimir Putin. The leaders would be in Kyiv, the statement said, as “representatives of the European Council”. “The purpose of the visit is to confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and to present a broad package of support for the Ukrainian state and society,” the Polish government’s statement said. They will meet as talks resume between Russian and Ukrainian representatives, with Zelenskiy suggesting that the previous round had gone “pretty well”. While earlier negotiations focused on humanitarian issues, the latest talks aim to achieve a ceasefire, securing Russian troop withdrawals and establishing security guarantees for Ukraine. The Russian delegate Leonid Slutsky had suggested draft agreements may not be far off. The EU member states formally agreed on a fourth sanctions package on Tuesday morning, including an asset freeze and travel ban on the Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich. He is described in the EU’s legal text as “a Russian oligarch who has long and close ties to Vladimir Putin”. “He has had privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him,” the text adds. “This connection with the Russian leader helped him to maintain his considerable wealth. “He is a major shareholder of the steel group Evraz, which is one of Russia’s largest taxpayers.” The new round of sanctions against Putin’s regime includes an EU import ban on a range of sensitive steel products and a ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector, with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU. The EU is also imposing a ban on the export of luxury goods, such as cars and jewellery, with a value of €300 (£250) or more. A ban on the rating of Russia and Russian companies by EU credit rating agencies and the provision of rating services to Russian clients will also be imposed. The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said: “As President Putin’s war against Ukrainian people continues, so does our resolve to support Ukraine and cripple the financing of Kremlin’s war machinery. “This fourth package of sanctions is another major blow to the economic and logistic base upon which Russia relies on to carry out the invasion of Ukraine. The aim of the sanctions is that President Putin stops this inhuman and senseless war.”",News/World news,"Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers travel to Kyiv",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/polish-czech-and-slovenian-prime-ministers-travel-to-kyiv-ukraine
3/15/2022,"The UK is to ban the export of luxury products to Russia including fashion and valuable artworks, as well as raising tariffs on key Russian products including vodka and fur, as part of the latest sanctions measures. Following a similar move in Washington, the UK is to deny Russia and Belarus access to most favoured nation tariff for hundreds of their exports – a key benefit of World Trade Organization membership. More sanctions on individual oligarchs and elites, as well as businesses, politicians and organisations are also expected to be announced this week after the passage of the economic crime bill, intended to make it swifter and easier to target oligarchs and Russian interests. The government said £900m-worth of goods would be subject to huge additional tariffs as a fresh barrier to trade with Russia, coming into force next week. Among the initial list of Russian goods facing additional 35% tariffs are Russian fur, vodka and other spirits, white fish, as well as industrial products such as fertilisers, tyres and cement. The export ban will include luxury vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art going from the UK to Russia. The Treasury said it would also no longer issue any new guarantees, loans and insurance for exports to Russia and Belarus. It said that without government export credit support, any financial backing from the private sector to the region was “virtually impossible”. The Department for International Trade said 54 licences for exports to Russia have already been voluntarily surrendered by UK businesses. Further individual sanctions are also expected to be announced. On Monday, MPs and peers sat late into the night to ensure the passage of the economic crime bill, which redrew some sanctions law, which ministers said would make sanctions and other economic measures easier. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has promised a “hit list” of hundreds more oligarchs, Russian elites, politicians, businesses and organisations that the UK will target, having been previously criticised for the slow pace of the sanctions. “Liz has moved heaven and earth to get this legislation done. It transforms our ability to sanction Russia and go further and faster than before,” one government source said.",News/Politics,UK imposes sanctions on Russian products and bans some exports,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/15/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-products-and-bans-some-exports
3/15/2022,"The British-Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has had her British passport returned, her MP, Tulip Siddiq, has said. The Hampstead and Kilburn MP tweeted: “I am very pleased to say that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been given her British passport back. “She is still at her family home in Tehran. I also understand that there is a British negotiating team in Tehran right now. I will keep posting updates as I get them.” There were reports that the UK government had paid a decades-old £400m debt to Iran in a move that could facilitate Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release from Tehran and that of another British-Iranian, Anoosheh Ashoori. There was no independent confirmation of the payment from the families of the two detainees, or from the UK Foreign Office. It has been widely accepted, but not officially confirmed by either government, that the payment of the debt, a source of deep anger for Tehran, would lead to their release and that they have in effect been kept as state hostages to persuade the UK to release the cash. Previous deals have collapsed, and the official government position for the last two years is that the debt is owed by the UK, but the US economic sanctions have meant it was not possible to pay the debt to any Iranian government organisation. Ashoori was sentenced to 10 years for spying and is held in Evin jail. He was arrested in Iran after flying out to see his mother in 2017. He was convicted in July 2019 of spying for Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has already served a five-year jail sentence following her arrest in 2016 when she went to visit her parents. She has been out on a tag in Tehran staying at her parent’s home, and in April 2021 was sentenced a second time to a further year in prison, but has not yet been called to jail. She could be required to return to jail at any time. The British Foreign Office has refused to describe her as a state hostage, a decision that has infuriated Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s family and legal advisers Redress. The payment of the debt would come as talks on reviving the Iran nuclear deal reach a climax in Vienna. Moscow has introduced some last-minute demands delaying a deal, including a requirement that any trade between Iran and Moscow is not subject to sanctions imposed by Washington due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Iranian foreign minister was due in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the Russian intervention and whether it could mean the near complete deal could be signed off.

3/15/2022,"In April 2020, while Covid-19 spread around the country, and millions of people were sheltering at home, Shay Meyers, the CEO of Owyhee Produce, one of the largest onion growers in the US, asked his workers to bury thousands of pounds of onions. The restaurants, school dining halls, and event centers that normally bought his onions were all shuttered. His cold storage was full. Even though the demand for onions in American kitchens remained as high as – or even higher than – before the pandemic, there simply wasn’t a way to get the food into the hands of those who needed it. In April alone, Owyhee Produce buried four million onions. “I was extremely worried about going out of business,” Myers said. Long before most of the emergency rooms were overloaded, it was the food system that showed the first signs of the enormous impact the pandemic would have. Empty shelves at the supermarket. Closed restaurants. Farmers dumping milk out into their fields or euthanizing animals as meat processing plants became overwhelmed or shut down. And it wasn’t just farmers or the restaurant owners or the agricultural industry that suffered: hunger spiked across the country. Food insecurity in the US increased from 11% to 15% during the pandemic, with at least 60 million Americans visiting a food bank during 2020, an increase of 50% from the year before. “The pandemic shifted everyone’s understanding of food as something we buy and sell,” said Michael Fakhri, UN special rapporteur on the right to food. People are finally realizing that food is more than just a commodity, he said. “Food is how we take care of each other, and most importantly, it’s how we take care of the land and water.” Covid’s upturning of the US food system gave those in the industry a preview of a future where pandemics, global conflict and extreme weather events exacerbated by the climate crisis will wreak havoc on our ability to provide food reliably and equitably (the latest IPCC report on the climate crisis warns about exactly this). Fast forward two years and many of the bottlenecks have been resolved. Restaurants are opening back up. Schools are full. Supermarket shelves are stocked. But as the food system begins to return to normal, voices throughout the industry are pushing for change. “The biggest problem is power – and power being concentrated in the hands of a few.” said Fakhri. A Guardian analysis found nearly 80% of dozens of everyday grocery items are supplied by just a handful of companies. Only four firms control half the market in chicken processing, almost 70% of pork and more than 80% of beef, while four biotech seed companies control half the world’s seed supply. Consolidation of power plays out even when looking at food insecurity, said Andy Fisher, the author of Big Hunger. Food banks and food stamps programs “are all tied into corporations”, he said, adding that the vast majority of food stamps goes to superstores and supermarkets, such as Walmart, Target, and Costco. “Food banks are the same thing,” Fisher said. “You see huge ties between food banks and industrial agriculture, whether it’s board members, volunteers, cash, or food donations. It’s all about propping up our agricultural markets.” The pandemic laid bare the problems with consolidation. Four large conglomerates control approximately 55-85% of the market for pork, beef, and poultry, according to an analysis cited by the White House as part of its recent efforts to boost competitiveness, particularly in meat processing. When just a few of slaughterhouse shut down due to Covid outbreaks, it left farmers with no way of getting their livestock processed and ready for distribution. When just a few of these shut down due to Covid outbreaks, it created a massive bottleneck, leaving farmers with no way of getting their livestock processed and ready for distribution. For Liz and Nate Brownlee of Nightfall Farms, the shortage of meat processors is not a new challenge. The Brownlees raise pigs, chickens and lambs and sell their meat locally in southern Indiana. “Back in 2018, farmers [in Indiana] were saying, ‘There’s not enough butcher shops, this is a bottleneck,’” said Liz Brownlee. This already tenuous situation became worse during the pandemic. When big meat suppliers such as Tyson and Perdue had to shut down their processing plants due to Covid outbreaks and grocery stores ran out of meat, demand for local products exploded. Farmers started raising more livestock, worsening the bottleneck. “All of a sudden, the butcher shops that we normally work with went from scheduling out three months to scheduling out a year,” Liz Brownlee said. For the Brownlees, this meant ending up with a product that’s harder to sell. “If the pigs grew slow because it was really cold, we get less meat back so we have smaller pork chops to sell. And the same thing is true on the other side. If they’re growing too fast, it’s just as hard to sell pork chops the size of dinner plates.” Two years after the pandemic began, small farmers in the US face the same mountain of challenges as before: high land costs, a system that favors corporate players, distribution built for scale and a labor supply at the mercy of changing immigration policy. They all just intensified. Until policies and systems adapt to support them, small farmers are left to their own devices to overcome systemic barriers. The Brownlees, who currently work part-time outside the farm to supplement their income, are hopeful they can find creative ways to turn their farm into a sustainable business. In 2017, they looked into starting their own small butcher shop. They ultimately decided not to move forward but shared their analysis with another local farm, which is opening the shop themselves. Another solution the Brownlees have discovered is running their own CSA (community supported agriculture), selling chicken, pork, lamb and eggs directly to customers through monthly membership boxes. “That reliability during the start of Covid was incredibly important to us. Our members stayed with us the entire time and we actually picked up more,” said Nate Brownlee. One of the things that makes our food system fragile, Fakhri said, is the lack of redundancy. When supermarkets run out of a type of food, there’s nowhere else for most people to get it from. “We have this mentality coming out of the ’80s and ’90s of ‘just in time’ delivery and of things being extremely streamlined. Things not sitting in warehouses, no storage, no backup,” Fakhri said. “Treating the supply of food by using the same model they use for the production of cars is part of the problem.” Solutions such as CSAs are the kind of redundancies that will help our food system prepare for the future, Fakhri said. “We need to create multiple supply chains.” Mandela Grocers, a small employee-owned cooperative grocery store in Oakland, California, was prepared for the particular problems of the pandemic. It gets its produce and meat from local producers. “We didn’t face those [supply chain] challenges because our supply chain is a lot shorter. There aren’t a lot of hands between our producers and our customers,” said Adrionna Fike, who works at the grocery store and like all seven workers, is a co-owner. “You won’t see Tyson meat here. We only sell one brand of chicken, that’s Mary’s chicken, because we trust Mary,” said Fike. The only things the store ran out of were gloves and paper bags, neither of which it sourced locally. Mandela offers steep discounts for people on food stamp programs or those who live in low income housing. Its workers earn $18 to $24 an hour, have benefits and participate in a profit-sharing model. It’s a stark contrast to some of the bigger grocery chains which have made huge profits during the pandemic, while their workers struggle. A recent report found that more than 75% of Kroger’s employees experience food insecurity. “At the height of the pandemic, we were having the biggest profits of our lives,” Fike said but Mandela’s took precautions to prevent burnout, including deciding against extending working hours to meet demand and closing on Sundays to give people an extra day of rest. Those decisions paid off – the store made it through the pandemic without a Covid outbreak or having to close due to staffing shortages. They raised wages in 2021 and employees earned the same even with closing on Sundays. Fike says that even if the wages aren’t grossly more than a chain grocery, their total compensation package is unmatchable by a chain grocery store. “No chain grocery store can do what we do.” Creating resilience in the face of global upheaval means focusing on the wider system, not just one aspect, said Fakhri. “You can have a shorter supply chain that will then reproduce the same problem of power and [lack of] accountability.” He believes the answer lies in transparency and accountability: knowing who is producing food and under what conditions, using government subsidies to support better farming and ensuring legal repercussions for worker exploitation, animal mistreatment and environmentally-harmful farm practices. As much as changes within the industry have an impact, experts warn that the most significant changes needed are policy changes. More robust anti-trust laws, something the Biden administration has indicated interest in, would be one of the most powerful ways to hold businesses accountable and limit the power being concentrated in just a few hands, Fakhri said. “Make markets work for people as opposed to the other way around. Right now, we’re all at the mercy of the markets.” When it comes to solving food insecurity, Fisher said that we need to stop looking at food banks and free food as solutions, and instead look at things like universal basic income, higher minimum wages, affordable housing, universal health care, and affordable childcare. “What we’ve developed is a system where we won’t give you money, but we’ll give you food, which has its roots in agricultural support programs.” “The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted what we have known for decades,” Fakhri wrote last year, “hunger, malnutrition and famine are not caused by inadequate amounts of food. They are caused by the political failures that restrict people’s access to adequate food.”",News/Environment,Covid exposed the cracks in the US food system – meet the people trying to fix them ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/covid-coronavirus-us-food-system-pandemic-cracks
3/15/2022,"The Red Tractor scheme, used to mark food produced to a “high standard”, is failing to regulate the use of pesticides on farms, a report has found. As the UK’s biggest farm and food assurance scheme, which certifies about 50,000 farmers, Red Tractor is relied upon to uphold environmental standards. The products are sold in all major UK supermarkets. However, most farmers surveyed by the Nature Friendly Farming Network said that the scheme did not help them to reduce pesticides. Overall, farmers felt Red Tractor was failing to help them to consider their pesticide management in any meaningful way, and was ineffective at assisting them to reduce pesticide use. Only five of the 24 survey respondents said they had been encouraged by Red Tractor to review their pesticide management. Martin Lines, a co-author of the report and chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said: “Our interviews with Red Tractor certified farmers have revealed that the standards are barely encouraging – let alone supporting – farmers to reduce their pesticide use. “There are many UK farmers working hard to switch to using non-chemical alternatives and it is time Red Tractor, as our largest farm and food assurance scheme, becomes a key player in driving the transition to more sustainable farming systems. Farmers want – and need – their support to work with nature instead of against it.” The report also pointed out that Red Tractor had no targets to reduce use of these harmful chemicals. Recent studies have revealed alarming global declines in insect populations, with more than 40% of insect species declining and a third endangered. Alongside habitat loss, pesticides have been identified as one of the key factors driving these declines. In the UK, butterflies have declined by 50% since 1976 and 13 species of bee have gone extinct. Perhaps as a result of the decline in insects, further up the food chain farmland birds have declined by 54% since 1970 and hedgehog numbers have fallen by up to 50% in rural areas since 2002. In addition, those pesticides that pose highest risks to human health and the environment, known by the UN as “highly hazardous pesticides”, are not being targeted for a phase-out by the scheme. Red Tractor standards do not include any additional restrictions concerning which pesticides farmers are allowed to use. Josie Cohen, head of policy and campaigns at Pesticide Action Network UK, said: “If we are to have any hope of solving the biodiversity crisis then we must move away from our dependence on pesticides. But Red Tractor standards continue to prioritise the use of chemicals, without placing limits on how much or where they can be used. Unlike many UK supermarkets, Red Tractor allows its farmers to use any legal pesticide product, regardless of concerns over impacts to human health or the environment.” Red Tractor responded that the sector as a whole needed to change its attitude towards pesticides, otherwise large numbers of farmers would be left behind and locked out of standards schemes. It added that the new report “makes some constructive suggestions about how Red Tractor content may evolve to meet these challenges and we welcome this contribution to the debate”.",News/Environment,Red Tractor ‘failing to regulate’ pesticide use for UK supermarket products,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/red-tractor-failing-to-regulate-pesticide-use-for-uk-supermarket-products
3/15/2022,"Dolma Sherpa worked as a nail technician for four years in New York City, up until the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the industry and left her with severely reduced work hours when the industry reopened. The work was already unstable, Sherpa explained, as she often worked seven days a week during busy times of the year, and then struggled to get hours and work through the winter. In 2019, Sherpa and other workers organizing in the nail salon industry succeeded in their fight for a $15 minimum wage, eliminating the tipped minimum wage in the industry that was driving wages down, but she noted there are still many employers who aren’t following the law or have found other ways to cut corners at the expense of workers. “They’re cutting tips, they’re cutting commissions. We don’t have control over schedules, they’re cutting our days, hours, and it’s not fair,” said Sherpa. “There are just so many ongoing challenges, despite what we’ve won in the past, whether it’s a lack of benefits, a lack of ventilation, health and safety issues, and retaliation.” She is now an organizer with Adhikaar, a non-profit worker center organizing Nepali-speaking communities. It is also one of the groups currently advocating for a bill introduced this year in the New York senate and assembly that would create a nail salon industry council with powers to establish workplace standards throughout the industry in the state. Sherpa argued nail salon workers deserve to be valued with fair wages, benefits and working conditions as professionals in other industries, as nail technicians undergo significant hours of training, courses and exams to obtain licenses to work in the industry. “This campaign is a continuation of our work and a way for us to make sure that we can speak up without fear and get some permanent changes to the industry,” added Sherpa. “What we’re proposing is something for not just now, but for the future and the creation of something that will exist for a very long time if we can win this.” The council would be the first of its kind in the nail salon industry in the US, similar to efforts in California to establish a fast-food sector council. The council would include 15 voting members and six non-voting members, including six workers, six employers, three public representatives, and three representatives each for employers and workers. “Creating an industry-wide body that brings workers, salon owners and the state together to bargain and establish a uniform set of expectations and standards is how we ensure that every worker has recourse and authority to fight back against their exploitation,” said state senator Jessica Ramos, co-author of the legislation, in a press release on the bill’s introduction. “Any policies that are made for workers need to be developed with workers at the table.” Both assembly and senate versions of the bill are currently in the committee phase, awaiting a decision on whether the bills will be reported to the full legislature for a vote. The need for change seems urgent. There are about 4,000 nail salons in New York City and 7,000 throughout the state. The nail salon industry in New York has an egregious record of abuses and exploitation of workers. In 2015, New York passed several laws aimed at reining in abuses, wage theft, and exploitation in the industry in response to a New York Times expose on the industry in New York City, but workers and organizers say there remains a significant lack of enforcement as these issues persist in the industry.

My joints are in pain,” added Ovalles. “I’ve had gastritis and had to remove my gallbladder from stones because we never were able to have a full lunch break. We used to eat at 4 or 5pm and had to rush to get back to work.”",News/US news,"Long hours, dangerous chemicals: nail salon workers fight for industry change",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/new-york-nail-salon-industry-council-workers

An explicit and honest discussion of sex by educator Ruby Rare, In Touch is a refreshing rejoinder to British reserve, extending “an intimate and playful education” around the different ways we connect to our bodies and to each other. Recent episodes on pornography and non-monogamy challenged widespread assumptions, misconceptions and taboos from an intersectional feminist perspective, with a view to making sex better for everyone. “By not talking about it, we’re unable to acknowledge how impactful it is, for good and for bad,” says Rare. Thanks in large part to Rare’s nuanced and empathic hosting, In Touch feels like a safe space from which to expand one’s mind.

A recent episode, for example, explores the possibility of transitioning to another economic model, challenging the prevailing principles of scarcity and offering comforting words from an imagined post-capitalist future. The result is an often uplifting insight into “other ways of working and living” – if you can look past the killer robots. Flash Forward recently went on hiatus after seven years, but will be returning later this year.

3/15/2022,"In the grip of the energy crisis, gas prices are already due to increase by 50% in April, and will spike higher later in the year, while the chancellor’s modest mitigations do little for unaffordable bills. Boris Johnson is about to produce an energy strategy to cut reliance on Russian imports and speed UK generation. He wobbles on fracking. But before he boasts some “world-beating” plan, hold on to this salient fact. If the Tories had not blocked progress on renewables and insulation over the last decade, Britain would already be generating more clean energy than the amount provided by the fuels imported from Russia. Tories may recall those sunlit days leading up to the 2010 election when David Cameron, as the green man of folklore, posed in the Arctic cheerily driving a husky team, as he rebranded his party with an oak tree and a Vote Blue, Go Green slogan. His greenery was environmental gauze to signify an end to the nasty party: he did the job pretty well. He did preserve Labour’s green policies initially, but in 2013 Cameron panicked when Labour’s Ed Miliband pledged a price freeze, after energy prices had risen by 37% in three years. Cut the “green crap” Cameron ordered, which was duly splashed across the Sun’s front page. The consequences were far-reaching. Stripping out green subsidies caused the number of homes getting loft or cavity wall insulation to plummet immediately by 92% and 74% respectively: those figures never recovered. He scrapped zero carbon building regulations, so a million homes have been built since 2016 with poor energy standards: our energy bills are £2.5bn higher as a direct result, says Simon Evans of Carbon Brief. Remember Cameron trying to fix a wind turbine to his roof as a charming gesture? Notting Hill in west London wasn’t windy enough. But later he axed the “green crap” levy on energy bills that subsidised wind and solar: that trifling 9% could have been replaced from general taxes. The industry says that onshore wind was on the verge of profitability when Cameron caved in to shire nimbys and effectively banned it, by allowing any objections to bar turbines. Virtually no energy was generated from new onshore wind afterwards. Solar was getting close to viability when his subsidy axe crashed the industry, costing thousands of jobs. Stuck in planning limbo, 649 onshore wind and solar schemes await consent: they could generate more than enough power to replace Russian imports, says Evans. Johnson may well green light them in his new policy but we should remember the lost decade of clean energy. Onshore windfarms have had strong public support in national polling yet small groups in Tory seats held sway. On the Somerset Levels, I argued with a tiny group protesting against four planned wind turbines beside eyesore pylons, the M5 and the Hinkley Point nuclear site, despite the climate crisis having recently caused disastrous local floods. I find wind turbines beautiful, like the wings of benevolent albatrosses sweeping across the sky. But beauty is subjective: their purpose makes them magnificent to me, while anti-greens hate them for their virtue signalling. Though offshore wind has not been as badly affected, uncertainty caused by the Cameron subsidy axe ended the world’s biggest offshore windfarm plan, the £4bn Atlantic Array in the Bristol Channel. Still local protesters, backed by celebrities, fight large solar farms in Suffolk and the necessary electric substations for a huge offshore windfarm that is planned (not very) close to Aldeburgh, with the capacity to power 1.4m homes. Johnson’s plan needs to include a generous bonus to compensate local communities for projects that are benefiting not only the nation but also the planet. Labour pledges a £28bn green recovery, with Ed Miliband laying out his plans for a “clean energy sprint” for a huge expansion in renewables and insulation. That’s the challenge for Johnson to meet: he is yet to spell out the politically difficult staging posts to net zero. His green homes grant scheme failed abysmally through incompetence, a £1.5bn fiasco that the National Audit Office found had insulated fewer than 10% of homes promised. Keeping his Cop26 pledges means rejecting the frackers: Jacob Rees-Mogg in this cabinet, Steve Baker and loud noises off from Nigel Farage. The right’s fracking fascination is a mystery when it would take years for the gas to flow, if it works at all without damage, amid ferocious local opposition. Why aren’t mighty turbines just as excitingly macho? The Renewable Energy Association’s CEO, Nina Skorupska, tells me that the companies she represents, “could construct more than the terawatt-hours imported from Russia within 18 months if the obstacles were unblocked”. Even before the impact of the invasion of Ukraine, gas already cost about four times more than the price of energy from wind and solar. UK windfarms are starting to repay the Treasury, earning more than the contract price agreed for their subsidy. Renewables are faster and cheaper than shale or new North Sea drilling, that would warp future investment towards fossil fuels. The frackers are plain perverse, unless you subscribe to the view that they’re in hock to big oil – or even to Vladimir Putin. Bizarrely, the Mail on Sunday raises questions about Frack Off’s funding and whether its campaigning benefits Putin. Will there be energy rationing, as in wartime, or blackouts as in the 1970s? Turning down thermostats and reducing the national speed limit to 55mph can avoid that. Road pricing needs accelerating, too, in the switch to electric cars. People will only make sacrifices if pain is fairly distributed and the weak protected with a more generous Warm Homes Discount. This Ukraine horror drives climate terror from front pages, but February’s IPPC report shows global warming gathering speed. And yet easing energy shortages by hastening global annihilation is the right’s strange cause. The Tories have conveniently forgotten their own “green crap” contribution to the energy gap.

3/15/2022,"Kali learned how to use technology by playing with his grandfather’s phone. Now, the Swiss teenager is trying to paralyse the digital presence of the Russian government and the Belarussian railway. Kali – and many others who contributed to this article – declined to share his real name because some of the action he is taking is illegal and because he fears Russian retaliation. He one of about 300,000 people who have signed up to a group on the chat app Telegram called “IT Army of Ukraine”, through which participants are assigned tasks designed to take the fight to Vladimir Putin. In so doing, they are trying to level the playing field between one of the world’s superpowers and Ukraine as it faces bombardment and invasion. The sprawling hacker army has been successful in disrupting Russian web services, according to NetBlocks, a company that monitors global internet connectivity. It says the availability of the websites of the Kremlin and the Duma – Russia’s lower house of parliament – has been “intermittent” since the invasion started. The sites for state-owned media services, several banks and the energy giant Gazprom have also been targeted. “The crowdsourced attacks have been successful in disrupting Russian government and state-backed media websites,” says Alp Toker, the director of NetBlocks. He adds that Russia has attempted to mitigate the attacks and deter hackers by filtering access to certain websites, which has caused further disruption. We are creating an IT army. We need digital talents. All operational tasks will be given here: https://t.co/Ie4ESfxoSn. There will be tasks for everyone. We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists. Like many of his peers, Kali was directed to the Telegram group, which has Ukrainian- and English-language versions, by Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister and minister for digital transformation. Fedorov, 31, has been using his vastly expanded Twitter profile to plead with executives at the world’s biggest tech firms to cut ties with Russia. On 26 February, he posted a link to the Telegram group, which was set up by his ministerial department. “We need digital talents,” he said. “There will be tasks for everyone.” While his home country has long maintained a policy of military neutrality, Kali was spurred to action when he saw Fedorov’s tweet. “I wanted to help and use my attacking skills to help Ukraine,” he says via Telegram. “I’m from Switzerland, but I’m a strong hacker and I’m so sorry for every Ukrainian. I do it because I stand with Ukraine and I want to help somehow. I think if we hack Russia’s infrastructure they will stop, maybe, because nothing will work any more.” Kali says his parents aren’t especially keen on what he is doing, although he tries not to tell them much about it. And he is not the only one. Caroline, a twentysomething from the New York metropolitan area, told her parents she had enlisted into the IT army just hours before we speak on the phone. “They’re starting to get concerned,” she says. Having watched in horror as Twitter and Instagram videos revealed the devastating impact the conflict is having on Ukrainian civilians, Caroline felt compelled to act when she saw Fedorov’s tweet. She had seen how destructive the spread of disinformation had been during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. “The 2016 election was an eye-opener to the unfortunate effects of these things, and how it really does affect some of our relationships out in the real world.” There was just one problem: she didn’t know what Telegram was. Unlike Kali, the former preschool teacher isn’t much of a hacker. At first, she was concerned that the app – which was founded by the exiled Russian billionaires Pavel and Nikolai Durov – was a trap. But, after some research, she downloaded it and joined the group. She felt out of her depth when the group’s administrators asked for hackers to bombard Russian state websites with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, by which websites are bombarded with traffic to make them unreachable. This is how many Russian government websites have been disabled since the invasion began. But Caroline realised things were getting lost in the torrent of information. Messages in the Ukrainian-language version of the group, for instance, can rack up hundreds of comments in less than an hour. So, she has been helping the English-language group by collating information for a website on how to support Ukraine and fight Russian disinformation campaigns. “I enjoy acting as that filter – as that wind to push the sails in the right direction,” she says. She spends hours every day sharing information in the Telegram chat to help the masses of subscribers. “I can’t explain it,” she says. “It’s just something that’s so innately human that has been inspiring me, the more involved I get. I recognise I’m not special by any means, so all I’m doing is gathering all this information to try to dismantle these campaigns of disinformation that are going on.” Enrique is a Lithuanian IT expert in his mid-30s. He felt that joining the Telegram group was “the right thing to do”. “Growing up with your parents telling you stories about how they were exiled to Siberia lives with you your whole life,” he says. “We are scared that we will be next.” He had largely overlooked the Russian occupation of the Donbas, an area in eastern Ukraine that Putin’s army invaded in 2014 and claimed as Russian territory. But as the news became more urgent on Lithuanian television, he couldn’t ignore the situation any longer. He is less focused on wrecking the Russian internet and more on co-opting ordinary Russians to rise up against their dictator. “I hope the world can put pressure on Russian people so much that they would be willing to re-evaluate their upbringing, understand that people are asking them to help, look at what is really happening and perhaps they will rise up that way,” he says. Enrique has been inspired by the bravery of the Ukrainian people. That includes those who have taken to the streets to defend their country – and those who have taken to their keyboards. Ukraine has 290,000 people who work in IT and is the world’s outsourcing tech desk. While many of them have given up their day jobs to fight for the army, others have signed up to the IT army. That includes Sam, who works for a global advertising-technology company. He has been using his expertise to send what he calls “counter-propaganda” to Russians through advertising platforms. “We’ve been in a hybrid war and a direct war with Russia since 2014,” he says. “It was the same, but on a smaller scale. We understand how Russia acts: they do propaganda here, then inside their country, then try to share their vision to the global community.” The Ukrainian advertising industry has sent what Sam calls “aggressive” videos that show captured Russian soldiers pleading with their mothers and trying to convince them about the reality of war in Ukraine. Others highlight the impact of sanctions on Russia and the strength of the Ukrainian army. “They will move everyone to act,” says Sam. About 100 advertising specialists from 50 agencies are designing and disseminating adverts to try to raise awareness within Russia and Belarus of what Russia is doing, ducking and diving around advertising bans and platform closures. Enrique has been impressed by the teamwork of the volunteer IT army. “I have never seen so many people wanting to do something in my whole life,” he says. “You ask for participants to crash something [break it] or run something and you have it.” The immediacy of social media – and the thrill of seeing instantaneous results – has become intoxicating. “Everything is live,” he says. “Everything is being streamed to everybody. Everything is online and easy to understand how to damage.” Alex, a Ukrainian software engineer, says the Telegram group is mostly used for DDoS attacks. “I wish there were more things to do in terms of helping the IT part [of the war].” He doesn’t want to cut off Russia from the internet, but rather find a way of showing Russians images of the war. This is what Anonymous, a hacking collective, claimed to have done with Russian TV channels this month. “My ideal way would be to do something that will demonstrate the truth for [Russians],” says Alex. However, suggestions for DDoS attacks are eagerly carried out. When links for target websites go up in the Telegram group, he says, “all of them are down” within half an hour. Some cybersecurity experts are worried, though. “There are some risks in having this volunteer army,” says Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey. He is concerned about the lack of accountability regarding who is directing the battle plan and the overarching strategy. “At best, what they’re doing is running interference,” he says. “It may be a nuisance to the Russians, but the attacks we’ve seen so far haven’t really affected the Russian fighting capability to any decisive effect.” Woodward says an army of 300,000 hackers will invariably include some bad seeds. “These volunteers might start attacking targets that are not really what the Ukrainian government wants,” he says. “This could be accidental. How often has ransomware spilled over and affected, say, a hospital? I don’t think anyone wants that.” There is also a risk that such an open call could easily be co-opted by the Russians to generate negative headlines. “You never quite know who is in a volunteer group,” he says. “Not only could they do something unwanted in the name of Ukraine, but they could also do something that plays directly into the Russians’ rhetoric.” The fear of infiltration is something that also concerns Agnes Venema, a national security and intelligence academic at the University of Malta. “How useful they are depends on how well you can vet them, how well you can coordinate them and how skilled they are,” she says. “Renaming Putin’s yacht is cute, but does the hacking of Russian television stations to play the Ukrainian anthem help the Ukrainians achieve their strategic goals?” Despite her misgivings, Venema finds the corralling of volunteer forces remarkable. “I’m not one for throwing superlatives around, but I would say this level of civic engagement is unprecedented,” she says. Nonetheless, she says, it could quickly backfire. As soon as hackers start taking orders from the Ukrainian army, they drop their status as civilians and could be considered combatants, she says. “That means that these people are legitimate military targets,” she says. Whether those defending Ukraine’s right to exist know or worry about that is another question. “I don’t care about it,” says Kali, who as we spoke was trying to DDoS a Russian news website that the Ukrainian IT army administrators had flagged as a source of disinformation. “I’ve never worried about it.”",News/World news,"‘It’s the right thing to do’: the 300,000 volunteer hackers coming together to fight Russia",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/volunteer-hackers-fight-russia
3/15/2022,"Two weeks ago, I walked into an upscale restaurant for a networking dinner. I was brand new to Miami, a city whose residents pride themselves on two-story strip clubs, too-orange spray tans, and rented Ferraris. I didn’t want to be here – neither at this dinner, nor in Miami – but since I was supposed to spend six months stuck in this city receiving medical treatment for a weird dizziness issue I’d been dealing with, I figured I’d try my best to make friends with any non-terrible Miamians I could find. Cue networking dinner. “Sir,” the maitre d’ told me, “you can’t come in wearing shorts and sandals.” I sprinted to a TJ Maxx and, not knowing anything about clothes, I put on the first thing in my size, threw my shorts and sandals into a plastic shopping bag, and returned to the restaurant anew. Upstairs in the dining room, Eric, the dinner host, walked over. He’s a bro. I’d had a phone call with him a week prior through a friend of a friend, and he kept using the word “sick”. Eric gave me a fist bump and then pointed to my seat next to a tall man wearing a blazer, who looked both nerdy and kind. Perhaps this man could be my new friend. I caught Blazerman mid-sentence: “ … and I minted two NFT bananas last week and then resold them for 5x the next day,” he said. Oh no. I don’t do crypto people, I thought. I turned to the attractive woman across the table. She appeared to be in her late 30s, had dark brown hair wound tightly in a bun, and wore an expensive-looking suit. Her name was Janine. “I haven’t touched NFTs yet,” Janine said to Blazerman. “But I might finally step out of Ethereum and check out Solana.” “Solana’s all hype. I’m only touching Avax for now,” chimed another man next to me who did his best to show that he wore a nice watch. On all sides, trapped. Over the past few years, there’s been an explosion in crypto. In the US, 86% of us have heard of it, and 16% have bought it. This seems to make sense. In our uncertain political times, the case for crypto feels more and more grounded: “The stock markets are riskier than ever! Keep your assets safe! Don’t let big scary governments block access to your hard-earned money!” All around me, culty, shortsighted sheeple seem to yell at me, ordering me to buy digital Jpegs of apes or sell my children for two Ethereum. Here in Miami, where the municipality itself has already made $7m off of “MiamiCoin”, the sheeple yell louder. Though I wanted to leave the dinner right there and then, I wanted to make friends even more. I soon realized that my role of ill-informed cynic who thinks all cryptopeople are incels who sit in dark basements using semi-clean spoons to eat out of ice cream cartons would only hold up for so long. I looked at Janine and figured I’d try engaging her again. I noticed her perfect red nails and good posture. She was probably powerful and important, I thought. Like a prosecutor, or some kind of big wig exec who manages gigantic factories where children make shoes. “What do you do for work?” I asked. “Well,” she said, sipping a glass of dark red wine. “My company helps organizations move Fiat off their balance sheets and into crypto.” Goddamn it. “What about you, Alex?” she asked as everyone turned to me. “Are you into crypto?” I hesitated. “Well … I bought a little bit on Coinbase last year, but most of my money is in stocks. It feels more secure?” The cold faces around the table pressed me to continue: “… But I’m definitely going to trade much more crypto soon.” Janine didn’t like this. “You’re very late to the game,” she said in a voice that sounded like I had told her I had just learned about the picture phone. “Yeah. I know. I just don’t want too much of my money in it. It could go down at any point.” Blazerman interjected. “At your age, it’s better to have more of your portfolio allocated to riskier bets, obviously.” “Mmhmm. Obviously,” I said, wondering how old he thought I was, all the while realizing that I still hadn’t found a Miami derm for Botox. I looked back to Blazerman. “Do you trade crypto, then? Like, is that your job?” I asked. “Ha,” he laughed flatly. “I used to daytrade Eth,” he said. “But now the fees are too high. Recently I’ve just been buying and holding L2s.” I stared. “L2s are layer-twos,” he said, excited to share the gospel. He used words like protocol and settling and bridging. Words that seemed to almost mean something, but not to me. “Oh, gotcha,” I said. Janine tried to help – she jumped in to offer an analogy her son had come up with – about how lazy teachers give out group projects to their classrooms so that there’s less grading per student, which is the same as L2s and L1s and reducing something called gas fees. “Your son came up with that?” Blazerman asked. “How old is he again?” “Fourteen,” she said. Impressive, I thought. Perhaps I should divert the conversation to finding out who did her botox. “He’s part of a new generation of degens,” Blazerman said, using the slang word for “degenerate”, a term adopted by the crypto community for someone who throws money at trades without researching what’s happening. It’s a label proudly worn. Janine smiled. The appetizer arrived. It looked like some sort of dairy dish, which I tend to avoid because dairy gives me acne, but I didn’t want to be the TJ Maxx-dressed, anti-crypto newb who also had dietary restrictions. “So. OK, I still don’t get what the big deal is,” I said. “If there are these things called gas fees, which just sound like transaction fees, and none of it is as safe as money, then why does any of it matter? Like, it’s not better than Venmo or Zelle or any of those. And no one really uses it to pay for things …” “I mean, not yet,” Janine said. “But the market is growing, and outside the US, many people are using it to pay for things. In Switzerland and Turkey, 11% of people own crypto, and in Nigeria, it’s 32%.” “Crypto is going to change everything,” Blazerman pressed on. “Especially with decentralized exchanges.” “Oh, like Coinbase?” I asked. “Ha. No.” They laughed at the idiot. “Coinbase is a centralized exchange,” Janine said. “That means Coinbase knows each person that is buying and selling. They make the transaction go through and they get in trouble when things go wrong, which is the opposite of something like a decentralized exchange, where the traders may be anonymized,” he said. “I mean. That sounds scary,” I said. “What if I’m giving my money to a drug dealer? Or a sex trafficker, or maybe even a gun lobbyist?” The joke at the end didn’t land. I was still in Florida. “Fintech’s wild west,” Blazerman said. The waiter arrived holding steak and cheesy pasta. I had worked up the courage to say something about dairy but the host, Eric, was walking over and I wanted to impress. I bit my tongue and accepted my pimpley fate. “Alex!” said Eric. “You getting the lay of the crypto land?” “Ha! I guess. I don’t really get it, but it seems like lots of people are making money, so …” Eric smiled. “Yeah, man. It’s about being early to these things. Most of the liquidity to projects nowadays is coming from traditional institutions starting to pour in,” he said, not really addressing my comment. “Let’s face it, the financial systems are crumbling, and we’re building the lifeboats.” I looked around to see if this sounded crazy to anyone else. “In time, you’ll come around,” he said, sounding like a Scientologist. “Yeah,” Blazerman said, “Alex’ll be a degen in no time.” “OK. So …” I began. “Let’s say I was potentially interested in this. I don’t want the world to crumble or whatever, but if I can make some money … I mean ... I’m not a developer.” “Oh, you’re fine. You don’t need to learn Solidity or anything. That’d be overkill. Just put some cash into things and join some Discords. You’ll be up all night. That’s what happened to EthMaxiPad over here,” he said, looking at Janine. “Dude, no,” said Janine, shooting him a look for having revealed her tasteless Discord name. Discord is like Slack, but for people with no jobs. “Eth maxi pad?” I asked Janine. “I changed it,” she said, “I was getting too much hate.” “She’s an eth maximalist. Thinks that Ethereum is the best,” Blazerman said. “Which, I don’t know that she’s wrong, but Alex, if you really wanna make money, it’s all about the L2s. Riskier, but more upside.” I pulled out my phone and texted myself: It’s all about the L2s. “Just go start placing tiny bets on things that sound fun. Follow crypto accounts on Twitter,” Eric said. “Get on Telegram. Watch the Bankless dudes,” said Janine. I texted myself again: Watch the Bankless dudes. “And then I just become rich?” I asked, half-joking. “Haha, sure, man,” Eric said as he turned around and sailed on his lifeboat, back to the other side of the room. The dinner continued like this for another hour or so. I took notes about things I don’t think anyone actually understands, like yield farming, cold storage, and stablecoin treasuries. And then I went home and fell into a hole of radicalization, learning about how our financial system is to be replaced by what I still think might just be a well-marketed Ponzi with a very loyal tribe. But that was two weeks ago. Now, I’m sitting at my desk in the dark with a semi-clean spoon and a carton of non-dairy ice cream, while I learn a programming language called Solidity. For the next few months I’ll be stuck here, dizzy in Miami, where people pride themselves on two-story strip clubs, too-orange spray tans, and rented Ferraris. Tomorrow, I’ll be going to a karaoke event with a group of degens, who are only mildly terrible and will undoubtedly continue to do their best to convince me about an impending financial crisis that I don’t know I believe will ever arrive. But hey, if I’m wrong, I’ll be thankful to them for having given me a lifeboat.",Lifestyle/Life and style,It happened to me: I accidentally attended a crypto bro dinner,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/15/cryptocurrency-coinbase-fintech-bros
3/15/2022,"A murder investigation is under way in Liverpool after a man was found stabbed to death in the street and a woman was found with knife injuries nearby. Merseyside police said they were called to reports of a man with “significant injuries” in the Old Swan area at 8.55pm on Monday.
